i 
must 
have 
struck RelNScrEv_bicycle
something 
while 
riding ScrEv_ride_bike
my 
bike 
because 
it 
suddenly 
lost RelNScrEv_bicycle
all 
its 
pressure 
. 
upon 
closer 
examination 
, 
i 
found ScrEv_notice_problem
a 
screw 
in 
it 
. 
i 
sighed UnrelEv_bicycle
with 
frustration 
and 
laid ScrEv_lay_bike_down
the 
bike 
on 
its 
side 
. 
i 
took+out ScrEv_get_tools
a 
wrench 
, 
a 
tube 
, 
and 
a 
tire 
tool 
out 
of 
my 
bag 
. 
i 
loosened ScrEv_loose_nut
the 
nut 
holding UnrelEv_bicycle
the 
wheel 
on 
my 
bike 
with 
the 
wrench 
and 
then 
undid ScrEv_free_wheel
the 
rest 
with 
my 
hands 
. 
when 
the 
wheel 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
free 
, 
i 
took RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
tire 
tool 
and 
wedged RelNScrEv_bicycle
it 
between 
the 
wheel 
and 
tire 
to 
remove ScrEv_take_tire_off
the 
rubber 
. 
i 
examined ScrEv_examine_tire
the 
inner 
tube 
and 
it 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
definitely 
beyond 
repair 
. 
i 
removed ScrEv_remove_tire
the 
damaged 
tube 
and 
replaced ScrEv_put_new_tire
it 
with 
the 
new 
one 
. 
i 
put ScrEv_put_new_tire
the 
tire 
back 
onto 
the 
wheel 
and 
pulled ScrEv_pull_air_pin
the 
air 
pin 
through 
the 
hole 
on 
the 
wheel 
. 
i 
took+out ScrEv_get_tools
my 
air 
pump 
and 
began UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
refill ScrEv_refill_tire_air
the 
tire 
with 
air 
. 
<end_of_story>_bicycle 
i 
ride ScrEv_ride_bike
my 
bike 
to 
work 
everyday 
. 
i 
also 
ride ScrEv_ride_bike
for 
pleasure 
on 
the 
weekends 
. 
this 
morning 
i 
was 
pedaling ScrEv_ride_bike
along 
and 
all 
of 
the 
sudden 
i 
could 
feel ScrEv_notice_problem
the 
gritty 
pavement 
scraping UnrelEv_bicycle
the 
rim 
. 
i 
got ScrEv_get_off
off 
the 
bike 
and 
sure 
enough 
the 
front 
tire 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
flat 
. 
well 
that 
is UnrelEv_bicycle
bad 
but 
not 
as 
bad 
if 
the 
rear 
tire 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
flat 
and 
i 
had 
to 
take ScrEv_other_bicycle
the 
chain 
off 
. 
i 
always 
carry UnrelEv_bicycle
a 
spare 
inner 
tube 
and 
have UnrelEv_bicycle
a 
pump 
on 
the 
frame 
of 
my 
bike 
. 
this 
was 
going 
to 
be UnrelEv_bicycle
easy 
as 
i 
have 
done UnrelEv_bicycle
this 
many 
times 
before 
. 
i 
loosened ScrEv_loose_nut
the 
lock 
nuts 
that 
hold UnrelEv_bicycle
the 
front 
tire 
in 
place 
and 
pulled ScrEv_take_tire_off
the 
tire 
from 
the 
frame 
. 
i 
looked RelNScrEv_bicycle
in 
my 
bike 
pack 
and 
found RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
tool 
that 
helps UnrelEv_bicycle
take ScrEv_take_tire_off
the 
tire 
off 
the 
rim 
. 
this 
took UnrelEv_bicycle
all 
of 
523 
minutes 
. 
when 
i 
had UnrelEv_bicycle
that 
off 
i 
took UnrelEv_bicycle
the 
old 
inner 
tube 
and 
placed UnrelEv_bicycle
it 
in 
my 
backpack 
to 
patch ScrEv_put_patch/seal
later 
. 
i 
then 
fit ScrEv_put_new_tire
the 
good 
inner 
tube 
inside 
the 
tire 
and 
in 
reverse 
order 
fitted ScrEv_put_new_tire
the 
tire 
to 
the 
rim 
. 
i 
next 
took ScrEv_get_tools
my 
pump 
and 
filled ScrEv_refill_tire_air
it 
up 
to 
the 
correct 
pressure 
. 
i 
put ScrEv_put_new_tire
the 
tire 
back 
on 
the 
front 
fork 
and 
tightened RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
locking UnrelEv_bicycle
nuts 
and 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
on 
my 
way 
. 
i 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
n't 
even 
late 
for 
work 
. 
<end_of_story>_bicycle 
the 
other 
day 
, 
my 
best 
friend 
and 
i 
were 
riding ScrEv_ride_bike
to 
his 
house 
. 
when 
we 
were UnrelEv_bicycle
almost 
there 
, 
i 
noticed ScrEv_notice_problem
that 
the 
front 
tire 
on 
my 
bicycle 
felt ScrEv_notice_problem
rather 
wobbly 
and 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
most 
likely 
flat 
. 
i 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
in 
luck 
however 
, 
as 
my 
friend 
had UnrelEv_bicycle
a 
bicycle 
repair 
kit 
and 
some 
spare 
tires 
. 
once 
we 
arrived UnrelEv_bicycle
at 
my 
friend 
's 
house 
, 
i 
asked UnrelEv_bicycle
my 
friend 
if 
he 
let UnrelEv_bicycle
me 
borrow UnrelEv_bicycle
his 
bicycle 
repair 
kit 
. 
first 
, 
i 
turned RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
bike 
over 
and 
removed ScrEv_take_tire_off
the 
front 
tire 
and 
tube 
. 
next 
i 
filled RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
tube 
with 
air 
to 
check ScrEv_examine_tire
where 
the 
tube 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
damaged 
, 
and 
found ScrEv_examine_tire
a 
small 
glass 
shard 
which 
had 
punctured RelNScrEv_bicycle
through 
it 
. 
after 
making UnrelEv_bicycle
ensure 
the 
tube 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
fully 
deflated 
, 
i 
repaired ScrEv_put_patch/seal
the 
puncture 
in 
the 
tube 
by 
using UnrelEv_bicycle
glue 
and 
applying ScrEv_put_patch/seal
a 
patch 
on 
top 
, 
then 
slid ScrEv_put_new_tire
it 
back 
onto 
the 
tire 
using UnrelEv_bicycle
my 
hands 
. 
next 
, 
i 
placed ScrEv_put_new_tire
and 
pushed ScrEv_put_new_tire
the 
tire 
back 
onto 
the 
tube 
. 
after 
which 
, 
i 
reconnected ScrEv_put_new_tire
the 
tire 
onto 
the 
bicycle 
. 
finally 
, 
i 
pumped ScrEv_refill_tire_air
air 
into 
the 
tire 
until 
it 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
filled+up ScrEv_refill_tire_air
and 
the 
bicycle 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
ready 
to 
be 
ridden ScrEv_ride_bike
again 
. 
<end_of_story>_bicycle 
last 
weekend 
i 
took ScrEv_ride_bike
a 
bike 
ride 
around 
my 
neighborhood 
. 
when 
i 
got UnrelEv_bicycle
back 
home 
, 
i 
noticed ScrEv_notice_problem
that 
my 
front 
tire 
looked UnrelEv_bicycle
low 
. 
i 
looked ScrEv_examine_tire
at 
the 
tire 
and 
realized UnrelEv_bicycle
there 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
a 
nail 
stuck RelNScrEv_bicycle
in 
it 
. 
i 
took RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
nail 
out 
. 
then 
removed ScrEv_take_tire_off
the 
tire 
from 
the 
bike 
. 
inside 
the 
tire 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
a 
bike 
tube 
. 
the 
air 
goes UnrelEv_bicycle
in 
the 
bike 
tube 
, 
but 
it 
was 
leaking RelNScrEv_bicycle
because 
of 
the 
hole 
the 
nail 
put RelNScrEv_bicycle
in 
it 
. 
i 
found ScrEv_get_tools
my 
patch 
kit 
, 
and 
glued ScrEv_put_patch/seal
a 
bike 
tube 
patch 
over 
the 
hole 
. 
then 
i 
got ScrEv_get_tools
my 
air 
pump 
. 
i 
pumped ScrEv_refill_tire_air
and 
pumped ScrEv_refill_tire_air
until 
the 
tube 
was 
inflated ScrEv_refill_tire_air
. 
afterwards 
, 
i 
put RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
bike 
tube 
in 
water 
to 
see ScrEv_check_new_tire
if 
there 
were UnrelEv_bicycle
any 
air 
bubbles 
. 
air 
bubbles 
in 
the 
water 
mean UnrelEv_bicycle
there 
's UnrelEv_bicycle
still 
a 
leak 
. 
luckily 
for 
me 
, 
it 
was 
no 
longer 
leaking RelNScrEv_bicycle
air 
! 
i 
put ScrEv_other_bicycle
the 
tire 
back 
over 
the 
top 
of 
the 
bike 
tube 
and 
put ScrEv_put_new_tire
the 
tire 
back 
on 
my 
bicycle 
. 
i 
looked ScrEv_check_new_tire
at 
it 
carefully 
, 
then 
hopped UnrelEv_bicycle
on 
for 
another 
ride 
around 
the 
neighborhood 
, 
this 
time 
avoiding UnrelEv_bicycle
any 
nails 
. 
<end_of_story>_bicycle 
i 
was 
riding ScrEv_ride_bike
down 
the 
sidewalk 
and 
noticed ScrEv_notice_problem
that 
my 
bicycle 
tire 
had 
gone RelNScrEv_bicycle
flat 
. 
i 
took UnrelEv_bicycle
my 
bike 
home 
and 
attempted UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
put ScrEv_refill_tire_air
air 
in 
the 
tire 
. 
i 
noticed ScrEv_notice_problem
a 
hissing UnrelEv_bicycle
noise 
coming UnrelEv_bicycle
from 
the 
tire 
and 
realized UnrelEv_bicycle
that 
it 
had UnrelEv_bicycle
a 
hole 
in 
it 
. 
i 
had UnrelEv_bicycle
a 
can 
of 
tire 
patch 
on 
the 
shelf 
in 
the 
garage 
. 
i 
took ScrEv_get_tools
a 
screwdriver 
and 
loosened ScrEv_take_tire_off
the 
tire 
from 
the 
metal 
rim 
of 
the 
bicycle 
. 
after 
i 
got ScrEv_take_tire_off
the 
tire 
off 
, 
i 
opened RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
can 
of 
tire 
patch 
and 
, 
with 
a 
wooden 
spatula 
, 
i 
applied ScrEv_put_patch/seal
some 
of 
the 
black 
tire 
patch 
to 
the 
inside 
of 
the 
tire 
where 
the 
hole 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
. 
i 
allowed UnrelEv_bicycle
it 
to 
dry RelNScrEv_bicycle
for 
a 
few 
hours 
. 
i 
put ScrEv_put_new_tire
the 
rubber 
tire 
back 
on 
the 
tire 
rim 
, 
and 
added ScrEv_refill_tire_air
air 
. 
the 
tire 
held UnrelEv_bicycle
air 
and 
there 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
no 
longer 
a 
hissing UnrelEv_bicycle
noise 
. 
i 
hope UnrelEv_bicycle
my 
repair 
holds UnrelEv_bicycle
for 
a 
long 
while 
. 
<end_of_story>_bicycle 
some 
years 
ago 
, 
i 
used ScrEv_ride_bike
my 
bike 
to 
get UnrelEv_bicycle
around 
town 
a 
lot 
. 
of 
course 
, 
came UnrelEv_bicycle
the 
time 
when 
you 
have 
to 
make+repairs Evoking_bicycle
. 
i 
found+out UnrelEv_bicycle
a 
lot 
about 
bicycle 
tires 
during 
this 
time 
. 
my 
tire 
had RelNScrEv_bicycle
a 
leak 
so 
i 
bought ScrEv_get_tools
a 
repair 
kit 
. 
i 
had UnrelEv_bicycle
no 
idea 
how 
to 
use UnrelEv_bicycle
it 
but 
i 
did 
find+out UnrelEv_bicycle
. 
i 
had 
to 
take ScrEv_free_wheel
the 
whole 
wheel 
off 
the 
bicycle 
. 
next 
i 
pried ScrEv_take_tire_off
the 
tires 
from 
the 
rim 
and 
that 
took UnrelEv_bicycle
some 
doing UnrelEv_bicycle
. 
okay 
once 
i 
got ScrEv_take_tire_off
that 
off 
i 
had 
to 
take ScrEv_take_tire_off
the 
inner 
tube 
out 
also 
and 
i 
learned UnrelEv_bicycle
that 
i 
had 
to 
be UnrelEv_bicycle
very 
careful 
with 
the 
inner 
tube 
because 
i 
could 
cause UnrelEv_bicycle
more 
damage 
by 
being UnrelEv_bicycle
rough 
. 
next 
, 
i 
took UnrelEv_bicycle
the 
inner 
tube 
to 
the 
gas 
station 
to 
get UnrelEv_bicycle
air 
since 
i 
did 
n't 
have UnrelEv_bicycle
a 
manual 
air 
pump 
. 
i 
learned UnrelEv_bicycle
really 
quickly 
that 
i 
needed 
to 
fill ScrEv_refill_tire_air
the 
inner 
tube 
with 
care 
or 
i 
would 
be 
buying UnrelEv_bicycle
another 
one 
since 
the 
air 
fills ScrEv_refill_tire_air
it 
quickly 
and 
the 
tube 
can 
pop UnrelEv_bicycle
. 
once 
i 
put RelNScrEv_bicycle
a 
little 
air 
in 
the 
tube 
i 
had 
to 
listen ScrEv_examine_tire
as 
i 
pressed RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
air 
out 
to 
determine ScrEv_examine_tire
where 
the 
leak 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
actually 
at 
. 
once 
the 
leak 
location 
was 
identified RelNScrEv_bicycle
then 
i 
was 
able 
to 
take UnrelEv_bicycle
the 
tube 
home 
and 
use UnrelEv_bicycle
the 
glue 
from 
the 
kit 
and 
apply ScrEv_put_patch/seal
the 
rubber 
patch 
. 
of 
course 
i 
had 
to 
allow UnrelEv_bicycle
the 
tube 
to 
dry RelNScrEv_bicycle
and 
then 
deflate RelNScrEv_bicycle
it 
to 
get ScrEv_put_new_tire
it 
back 
on 
the 
bicycle 
. 
once 
i 
got UnrelEv_bicycle
it 
all 
put ScrEv_put_new_tire
back 
together 
i 
walked UnrelEv_bicycle
my 
bike 
back 
to 
the 
gas 
station 
for 
air 
. 
<end_of_story>_bicycle 
i 
went UnrelEv_bicycle
out 
to 
ride ScrEv_ride_bike
my 
bicycle 
one 
morning 
, 
only 
to 
find ScrEv_notice_problem
that 
my 
front 
tire 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
very 
flat 
. 
i 
grabbed ScrEv_get_tools
my 
manual 
air 
pump 
and 
tried UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
put ScrEv_refill_tire_air
air 
into 
it 
, 
but 
it 
would 
not 
hold UnrelEv_bicycle
any 
and 
kept UnrelEv_bicycle
going RelNScrEv_bicycle
flat 
. 
i 
heard UnrelEv_bicycle
a 
hissing UnrelEv_bicycle
sound 
, 
so 
i 
knew UnrelEv_bicycle
i 
had 
punctured RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
tire 
somehow 
. 
luckily 
i 
had UnrelEv_bicycle
a 
spare 
inner 
tube 
that 
i 
could 
put+on ScrEv_put_new_tire
. 
i 
flipped RelNScrEv_bicycle
my 
bicycle 
over 
and 
took ScrEv_get_tools
a 
wrench 
to 
remove ScrEv_take_tire_off
the 
tire 
from 
the 
spokes 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
kind 
of 
greasy 
and 
messy 
, 
but 
i 
did 
n't 
mind UnrelEv_bicycle
. 
i 
was 
able 
to 
get ScrEv_take_tire_off
it 
off 
pretty 
easily 
. 
i 
then 
pushed ScrEv_take_tire_off
the 
tire 
off 
of 
the 
rim 
all 
the 
way 
around 
. 
when 
the 
tire 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
off 
the 
rim 
, 
i 
took RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
spare 
tube 
i 
had UnrelEv_bicycle
and 
put ScrEv_put_new_tire
it 
all 
around 
the 
inside 
of 
the 
tire 
. 
i 
then 
pushed ScrEv_put_new_tire
the 
tire 
back 
onto 
the 
rim 
. 
it 
did 
not 
go+on UnrelEv_bicycle
as 
easily 
as 
it 
came+off UnrelEv_bicycle
, 
and 
it 
took UnrelEv_bicycle
a 
bit 
of 
struggling UnrelEv_bicycle
with 
the 
tire 
to 
get ScrEv_put_new_tire
it 
back 
on 
. 
finally 
i 
had UnrelEv_bicycle
it 
on 
. 
i 
took ScrEv_get_tools
my 
manual 
air 
pump 
and 
pumped ScrEv_refill_tire_air
up 
the 
tube 
inside 
of 
the 
tire 
. 
it 
held UnrelEv_bicycle
air 
very 
nicely 
, 
and 
i 
did 
n't 
hear UnrelEv_bicycle
any 
hissing UnrelEv_bicycle
and 
it 
did 
not 
go RelNScrEv_bicycle
flat 
. 
i 
then 
put ScrEv_other_bicycle
the 
tire 
back 
on 
the 
front 
bicycle 
fork 
, 
and 
tightened ScrEv_other_bicycle
the 
nuts 
so 
it 
would 
hold UnrelEv_bicycle
very 
well 
and 
not 
slip UnrelEv_bicycle
or 
come+off UnrelEv_bicycle
. 
i 
then 
flipped RelNScrEv_bicycle
my 
bicycle 
over 
and 
made+sure ScrEv_check_new_tire
the 
tire 
was 
still 
holding UnrelEv_bicycle
air 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
, 
so 
i 
put+on UnrelEv_bicycle
my 
helmet 
, 
and 
finally 
was 
able 
to 
enjoy UnrelEv_bicycle
my 
morning 
bike+ride ScrEv_ride_bike
. 
<end_of_story>_bicycle 
my 
bike 
tire 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
flat 
so 
i 
went RelNScrEv_bicycle
to 
the 
bike 
shop 
and 
bought RelNScrEv_bicycle
a 
replacement 
. 
i 
first 
took ScrEv_take_tire_off
the 
old 
tire 
off 
of 
my 
bike 
. 
then 
i 
set RelNScrEv_bicycle
my 
bike 
on 
a 
rack 
to 
that 
the 
flat 
tire 
would 
be UnrelEv_bicycle
easy 
to 
get UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
. 
then 
i 
put RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
new 
tire 
around 
the 
wheel 
to 
see RelNScrEv_bicycle
if 
it 
fits UnrelEv_bicycle
. 
it 
did UnrelEv_bicycle
. 
then 
i 
put ScrEv_put_new_tire
the 
new 
tire 
into 
the 
grooves 
inside 
the 
wheel 
. 
then 
i 
walked UnrelEv_bicycle
with 
my 
bike 
to 
the 
gas 
station 
just 
around 
the 
corner 
to 
fill ScrEv_refill_tire_air
it 
up 
with 
air 
. 
i 
put UnrelEv_bicycle
a 
quarter 
into 
the 
air 
machine 
and 
put UnrelEv_bicycle
my 
bike 
next 
to 
the 
air 
hose 
and 
filled ScrEv_refill_tire_air
the 
tire 
up 
. 
i 
checked ScrEv_check_new_tire
the 
air 
pressure 
with 
a 
gauge 
and 
it 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
alright 
. 
i 
felt ScrEv_check_new_tire
around 
the 
tire 
to 
make+sure ScrEv_check_new_tire
that 
it 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
solidly 
in 
place 
and 
it 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
. 
<end_of_story>_bicycle 
while 
i 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
out 
riding ScrEv_ride_bike
my 
bike 
one 
warm 
spring 
day 
, 
one 
of 
the 
tires 
went RelNScrEv_bicycle
flat 
. 
fortunately 
i 
had UnrelEv_bicycle
a 
repair 
kit 
with 
me 
in 
a 
pouch 
on 
the 
bike 
. 
i 
always 
kept UnrelEv_bicycle
it 
with 
me 
on 
rides ScrEv_ride_bike
just 
in 
case 
of 
such 
an 
occurrence 
. 
i 
got+off ScrEv_get_off
and 
went RelNScrEv_bicycle
to 
the 
side 
of 
the 
trail 
out 
of 
the 
way 
of 
other 
bikers 
and 
runners 
. 
i 
lay ScrEv_lay_bike_down
the 
bike 
on 
its 
side 
and 
got ScrEv_get_tools
the 
repair 
kit 
out 
of 
the 
pouch 
. 
the 
repair 
kit 
contained UnrelEv_bicycle
a 
new 
inner 
tube 
which 
i 
inflated ScrEv_refill_tire_air
. 
i 
then 
pulled ScrEv_take_tire_off
the 
outer 
tire 
off 
of 
the 
inner 
tube 
. 
i 
replaced ScrEv_put_new_tire
the 
flattened RelNScrEv_bicycle
inner 
tube 
with 
the 
new 
one 
and 
replaced ScrEv_put_new_tire
the 
outer 
tire 
over 
it 
. 
i 
rode+off ScrEv_ride_bike
slowly 
to 
make+sure ScrEv_check_new_tire
everything 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
correctly 
in 
place 
. 
once 
i 
got UnrelEv_bicycle
home 
, 
i 
replaced UnrelEv_bicycle
the 
spare 
tire 
kit 
with 
a 
new 
one 
so 
that 
i 
would 
be UnrelEv_bicycle
prepared 
on 
my 
next 
ride ScrEv_ride_bike
. 
<end_of_story>_bicycle 
while 
riding ScrEv_ride_bike
down 
the 
street 
i 
got RelNScrEv_bicycle
a 
flat 
tire 
on 
my 
bike 
. 
i 
found+out ScrEv_examine_tire
for 
sure 
that 
the 
tire 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
actually 
flat 
by 
trying UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
fill RelNScrEv_bicycle
it 
up 
and 
see ScrEv_examine_tire
if 
it 
held UnrelEv_bicycle
air 
. 
it 
did 
not 
stay UnrelEv_bicycle
inflated 
so 
i 
thought UnrelEv_bicycle
that 
i 
needed 
to 
replace ScrEv_put_new_tire
the 
inner 
tube 
. 
i 
went UnrelEv_bicycle
and 
got ScrEv_get_tools
my 
dad 
's 
adjustable 
wrench 
from 
the 
garage 
, 
hoping UnrelEv_bicycle
he 
would 
not 
be UnrelEv_bicycle
angry 
. 
i 
removed ScrEv_free_wheel
the 
wheel 
by 
loosening ScrEv_loose_nut
the 
two 
nuts 
using UnrelEv_bicycle
the 
wrench 
and 
almost 
caught UnrelEv_bicycle
my 
finger 
in 
the 
chain 
. 
after 
the 
wheel 
had 
been 
removed ScrEv_free_wheel
, 
i 
removed ScrEv_take_tire_off
the 
tire 
and 
tube 
from 
the 
wheel 
rim 
and 
nearly 
cut UnrelEv_bicycle
my 
hand 
again 
. 
i 
removed ScrEv_remove_tire
the 
old 
-lrb- 
flat 
-rrb- 
inner 
tube 
and 
replace ScrEv_put_new_tire
it 
with 
a 
new 
tube 
that 
i 
bought RelNScrEv_bicycle
at 
the 
store 
down 
the 
street 
. 
the 
guy 
at 
the 
store 
said UnrelEv_bicycle
that 
if 
the 
hole 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
small 
enough 
, 
i 
could 
possibly 
patch ScrEv_put_patch/seal
the 
hole 
using UnrelEv_bicycle
a 
tire 
patch 
kit 
. 
i 
told UnrelEv_bicycle
the 
man 
that 
the 
hole 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
523 
inches 
long 
and 
he 
said UnrelEv_bicycle
i 
needed 
to 
replace ScrEv_put_new_tire
the 
inner 
tube-but 
i 
already 
figured UnrelEv_bicycle
that 
out 
because 
it 
happened UnrelEv_bicycle
last 
summer 
too 
. 
when 
i 
finally 
had UnrelEv_bicycle
the 
new 
tube 
in 
the 
tire 
, 
i 
put ScrEv_put_new_tire
the 
tire 
back 
on 
the 
rim 
and 
made+sure ScrEv_check_new_tire
that 
the 
tube 
stem 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
in 
the 
right 
place 
. 
i 
had UnrelEv_bicycle
some 
lemonade 
and 
then 
i 
put ScrEv_other_bicycle
the 
wheel 
back 
on 
the 
bike 
and 
tightened ScrEv_other_bicycle
the 
nuts 
. 
then 
i 
inflated ScrEv_refill_tire_air
the 
tire 
and 
rode ScrEv_ride_bike
to 
my 
friend 
steve 
's 
house 
to 
play UnrelEv_bicycle
video 
games 
. 
<end_of_story>_bicycle 
yesterday 
afternoon 
, 
i 
decided UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
ride ScrEv_ride_bike
my 
bike 
to 
central 
park 
. 
i 
rode ScrEv_ride_bike
my 
bike 
to 
the 
park 
from 
my 
apartment 
, 
it 
took UnrelEv_bicycle
me 
about 
523 
minutes 
. 
i 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
very 
excited 
and 
happy 
because 
i 
have 
n't 
rode ScrEv_ride_bike
my 
bike 
in 
a 
very 
long 
time 
. 
i 
missed UnrelEv_bicycle
the 
experience 
of 
feeling UnrelEv_bicycle
the 
window 
blowing UnrelEv_bicycle
against 
my 
face 
, 
and 
feeling UnrelEv_bicycle
my 
hair 
float UnrelEv_bicycle
in 
the 
air 
. 
when 
i 
finally 
got UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
the 
park 
, 
i 
decided UnrelEv_bicycle
that 
i 
would 
ride ScrEv_ride_bike
around 
the 
park 
a 
few 
times 
. 
it 
was 
going 
to 
be UnrelEv_bicycle
a 
great 
form 
of 
exercise 
. 
however 
, 
after 
i 
rode ScrEv_ride_bike
the 
bike 
a 
few 
times 
around 
the 
park 
, 
my 
front 
bicycle 
tire 
suddenly 
started UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
lose RelNScrEv_bicycle
air 
. 
i 
safely 
got+off ScrEv_get_off
and 
examined ScrEv_examine_tire
the 
tire 
wheel 
. 
i 
checked ScrEv_examine_tire
if 
there 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
any 
rips 
or 
holes 
on 
the 
wheel 
. 
perhaps 
i 
rode ScrEv_ride_bike
over 
something 
sharp 
. 
i 
found RelNScrEv_bicycle
a 
few 
small 
holes 
on 
the 
bike 
and 
realized UnrelEv_bicycle
the 
culprit 
for 
my 
flat 
tire 
. 
i 
was 
forced UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
carry RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
bike 
home 
in 
order 
to 
repair+it Evoking_bicycle
. 
there 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
no 
way 
i 
would 
repair+it Evoking_bicycle
at 
the 
park 
. 
once 
i 
brought RelNScrEv_bicycle
it 
home 
, 
i 
brought RelNScrEv_bicycle
it 
to 
my 
basement 
. 
i 
turned RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
bike 
over 
so 
that 
it 
stood UnrelEv_bicycle
on 
its 
seat 
and 
handle 
bars 
. 
i 
let RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
remaining UnrelEv_bicycle
air 
out 
of 
the 
tube 
of 
my 
broken 
tire 
. 
once 
the 
tire 
was 
deflated RelNScrEv_bicycle
, 
i 
took ScrEv_take_tire_off
the 
tire 
off 
the 
rim 
. 
i 
found RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
part 
of 
the 
tire 
with 
the 
multiple 
holes 
. 
i 
spread RelNScrEv_bicycle
a 
thin 
layer 
of 
glue 
around 
the 
holes 
. 
then 
i 
looked+around RelNScrEv_bicycle
for 
my 
tire 
patch 
kit 
. 
once 
i 
found RelNScrEv_bicycle
it 
, 
i 
applied ScrEv_put_patch/seal
it 
on 
to 
the 
holes 
and 
covered RelNScrEv_bicycle
over 
them 
. 
i 
then 
placed ScrEv_put_new_tire
the 
tire 
back 
on 
the 
rim 
and 
inflated ScrEv_refill_tire_air
it 
again 
. 
<end_of_story>_bicycle 
last 
week 
on 
a 
bike+ride ScrEv_ride_bike
to 
my 
friends 
house 
, 
i 
was 
traveling ScrEv_ride_bike
on 
a 
very 
rough 
road 
with 
a 
lot 
of 
rocks 
on 
the 
side 
of 
it 
. 
i 
realized ScrEv_notice_problem
after 
about 
523 
minutes 
into 
my 
ride ScrEv_ride_bike
that 
i 
had UnrelEv_bicycle
a 
very 
bad 
flat 
tire 
. 
thankfully 
i 
carry UnrelEv_bicycle
the 
proper 
tools 
and 
items 
with 
me 
to 
fix+it Evoking_bicycle
. 
i 
pulled RelNScrEv_bicycle
off 
the 
road 
and 
opened RelNScrEv_bicycle
my 
bag 
with 
my 
tools 
. 
after 
removing ScrEv_take_tire_off
the 
tire 
and 
the 
tube 
inside 
, 
i 
used UnrelEv_bicycle
my 
tools 
to 
put ScrEv_put_new_tire
a 
brand 
new 
tube 
inside 
of 
the 
tire 
. 
i 
checked ScrEv_check_new_tire
it 
to 
make+sure ScrEv_check_new_tire
that 
i 
had 
aligned UnrelEv_bicycle
everything 
correctly 
and 
after 
ensuring ScrEv_check_new_tire
that 
i 
did UnrelEv_bicycle
, 
i 
placed ScrEv_put_new_tire
the 
tire 
back 
onto 
the 
bike 
. 
i 
then 
used UnrelEv_bicycle
my 
portable 
pump 
to 
make+sure ScrEv_check_new_tire
that 
i 
had UnrelEv_bicycle
the 
proper 
amount 
of 
air 
pressure 
inside 
of 
it 
, 
because 
i 
did 
n't 
want UnrelEv_bicycle
another 
flat 
. 
after 
checking ScrEv_check_new_tire
everything 
twice 
, 
i 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
on 
my 
way 
again 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
an 
easy 
fix 
. 
<end_of_story>_bicycle 
i 
was 
riding ScrEv_ride_bike
my 
bike 
along 
the 
road 
when 
a 
tire 
blew+out RelNScrEv_bicycle
. 
i 
dragged RelNScrEv_bicycle
it 
back 
to 
my 
garage 
and 
began UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
repair+my+bicycle+'s+tire Evoking_bicycle
. 
i 
flipped RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
bike 
upside 
down 
and 
stood RelNScrEv_bicycle
it 
up 
so 
that 
i 
could 
work RelNScrEv_bicycle
on 
it 
from 
the 
bottom-up 
. 
i 
took+off ScrEv_take_tire_off
the 
old 
tire 
and 
began 
putting+on ScrEv_put_new_tire
the 
new 
one 
that 
i 
had UnrelEv_bicycle
around 
in 
my 
garage 
. 
once 
i 
replaced ScrEv_put_new_tire
the 
tire 
i 
flipped RelNScrEv_bicycle
it 
back 
around 
to 
make+sure ScrEv_check_new_tire
that 
i 
had 
put ScrEv_put_new_tire
it 
on 
correctly 
and 
once 
i 
had 
double 
checked ScrEv_check_new_tire
that 
it 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
on 
correctly 
i 
started UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
ride ScrEv_ride_bike
my 
bike 
down 
the 
road 
to 
test RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
bicycle 
and 
the 
tire 
so 
that 
if 
there 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
something 
wrong 
with 
it 
i 
could 
figure ScrEv_notice_problem
it 
out 
now 
and 
not 
after 
in 
case 
i 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
in 
a 
situation 
, 
such 
as 
going UnrelEv_bicycle
down 
a 
hill 
, 
that 
it 
could 
be UnrelEv_bicycle
harmful 
to 
me 
in 
any 
way 
. 
<end_of_story>_bicycle 
while 
i 
was 
riding ScrEv_ride_bike
my 
bike 
i 
accidentally 
ran+over RelNScrEv_bicycle
a 
nail 
. 
my 
rear 
tire 
quickly 
deflated RelNScrEv_bicycle
. 
i 
walked RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
bike 
home 
. 
my 
bike 
tire 
had UnrelEv_bicycle
an 
inner 
tube 
, 
and 
i 
had UnrelEv_bicycle
an 
extra 
one 
in 
my 
basement 
. 
i 
got RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
extra 
inner 
tube 
and 
went UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
work 
. 
in 
order 
to 
fix+my+tire Evoking_bicycle
, 
i 
had 
to 
pry ScrEv_take_tire_off
the 
rubber 
outer 
tire 
out 
of 
the 
wheel 
's 
metal 
rim 
. 
i 
got ScrEv_get_tools
a 
screwdriver 
and 
inserted RelNScrEv_bicycle
it 
between 
the 
metal 
and 
rubber 
, 
lifting ScrEv_take_tire_off
the 
rubber 
out 
. 
i 
went UnrelEv_bicycle
around 
the 
rim 
that 
way 
taking ScrEv_take_tire_off
the 
tire 
out 
of 
the 
rim 
. 
once 
it 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
out 
, 
i 
was 
able 
to 
pull ScrEv_take_tire_off
the 
broken 
inner 
tube 
out 
. 
as 
i 
'd 
figured UnrelEv_bicycle
, 
there 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
a 
big 
hole 
in 
it 
from 
the 
nail 
. 
i 
put ScrEv_remove_tire
the 
old 
inner 
tube 
aside 
and 
got RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
new 
one 
. 
there 
's UnrelEv_bicycle
a 
part 
on 
the 
tube 
where 
a 
valve 
comes+out UnrelEv_bicycle
. 
that 
's 
where 
you 
attach RelNScrEv_bicycle
a 
pump 
to 
fill ScrEv_refill_tire_air
the 
tube 
with 
air 
. 
i 
put RelNScrEv_bicycle
this 
valve 
through 
the 
hole 
in 
the 
rim 
that 
it 
's UnrelEv_bicycle
supposed 
to 
stick+through UnrelEv_bicycle
. 
then 
i 
went UnrelEv_bicycle
around 
the 
rim 
squeezing ScrEv_put_new_tire
the 
inner 
tube 
into 
the 
tire 
. 
once 
i 
had UnrelEv_bicycle
the 
inner 
tube 
in 
place 
, 
i 
went UnrelEv_bicycle
around 
the 
rim 
again 
pushing ScrEv_put_new_tire
the 
outer 
part 
of 
the 
tire 
back 
into 
the 
rim 
. 
that 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
hard 
work 
, 
but 
i 
finally 
managed UnrelEv_bicycle
it 
. 
once 
that 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
done 
, 
i 
got+out ScrEv_get_tools
my 
bike 
pump 
, 
fitted RelNScrEv_bicycle
it 
to 
the 
inner 
tube 
's 
valve 
, 
and 
filled ScrEv_refill_tire_air
the 
new 
tire 
with 
air 
. 
soon 
my 
tire 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
completely 
repaired Evoking_bicycle
and 
i 
was 
able 
to 
ride ScrEv_ride_bike
again 
! 
<end_of_story>_bicycle 
i 
was 
going 
to 
go ScrEv_ride_bike
on 
a 
bike 
ride 
with 
a 
friend 
. 
i 
pulled UnrelEv_bicycle
my 
bike 
out 
of 
the 
garage 
only 
to 
discover ScrEv_notice_problem
i 
had 
a 
flat 
tire 
. 
i 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
n't 
sure 
if 
the 
flat 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
just 
from 
a 
slow 
leak 
or 
a 
bad 
tube 
. 
if 
it 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
from 
a 
bad 
tube 
i 
would 
have 
to 
use UnrelEv_bicycle
tools 
to 
take ScrEv_take_tire_off
the 
tire 
completely 
off 
. 
then 
i 
would 
have 
to 
replace ScrEv_put_new_tire
the 
tube 
. 
if 
it 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
just 
a 
slow 
leak 
i 
could 
just 
inflate ScrEv_refill_tire_air
the 
tire 
with 
my 
air 
pump 
and 
be UnrelEv_bicycle
on 
my 
way 
. 
i 
decided UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
try UnrelEv_bicycle
the 
easy 
route 
first 
and 
inflated ScrEv_refill_tire_air
the 
tire 
with 
the 
pump 
. 
it 
felt ScrEv_check_new_tire
as 
if 
the 
tire 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
full 
and 
the 
problem 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
solved 
. 
i 
took ScrEv_ride_bike
the 
bike 
for 
a 
test 
ride 
around 
the 
neighborhood 
just 
to 
be UnrelEv_bicycle
sure 
that 
it 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
fully 
inflated ScrEv_refill_tire_air
and 
would 
stay UnrelEv_bicycle
that 
way 
. 
it 
stayed UnrelEv_bicycle
inflated ScrEv_refill_tire_air
and 
i 
set+off ScrEv_ride_bike
to 
meet UnrelEv_bicycle
with 
my 
friend 
. 
<end_of_story>_bicycle 
one 
time 
i 
drove ScrEv_ride_bike
over 
a 
piece 
of 
glass 
and 
it 
put RelNScrEv_bicycle
a 
hole 
into 
my 
bicycle 
tire 
. 
i 
had 
to 
walk RelNScrEv_bicycle
my 
bicycle 
all 
the 
way 
home 
, 
which 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
very 
unpleasant 
, 
and 
then 
i 
could 
not 
use ScrEv_ride_bike
my 
bike 
again 
until 
i 
had 
fixed+it Evoking_bicycle
. 
so 
i 
looked+up RelNScrEv_bicycle
online 
how 
to 
fix+a+punctured+tire Evoking_bicycle
, 
and 
went RelNScrEv_bicycle
to 
the 
hardware 
store 
to 
pick+up ScrEv_get_tools
the 
necessary 
tools 
. 
after 
purchasing ScrEv_get_tools
these 
tools 
i 
pumped ScrEv_refill_tire_air
some 
air 
into 
the 
tire 
to 
locate RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
hole 
and 
then 
i 
took ScrEv_take_tire_off
the 
tire 
off 
of 
the 
wheel 
to 
repair+it Evoking_bicycle
. 
i 
followed UnrelEv_bicycle
the 
directions 
on 
the 
repair 
kit 
which 
were UnrelEv_bicycle
actually 
very 
simple 
. 
after 
i 
had 
patched ScrEv_put_patch/seal
the 
hole 
, 
i 
waited RelNScrEv_bicycle
for 
the 
adhesive 
material 
to 
dry RelNScrEv_bicycle
and 
then 
i 
took ScrEv_ride_bike
the 
bike 
out 
for 
a 
short 
test 
run 
to 
make+sure ScrEv_check_new_tire
that 
if 
the 
tire 
failed RelNScrEv_bicycle
again 
i 
would 
not 
be UnrelEv_bicycle
far 
from 
home 
. 
<end_of_story>_bicycle 
if 
you 
have UnrelEv_bicycle
a 
flat 
tire 
it 
is UnrelEv_bicycle
quite 
easy 
to 
change+it Evoking_bicycle
yourself 
. 
the 
front 
tire 
is UnrelEv_bicycle
the 
easiest 
to 
change Unclear_bicycle
while 
the 
back 
will 
require UnrelEv_bicycle
more 
time 
and 
maybe 
additional 
tools 
. 
this 
is UnrelEv_bicycle
usually 
the 
back 
tire 
is UnrelEv_bicycle
where 
the 
chain 
and 
gears 
are 
connected UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
so 
it 
is 
harder 
to 
take+off ScrEv_free_wheel
the 
bike 
frame 
. 
sadly 
, 
most 
of 
the 
time 
a 
flat 
tire 
is UnrelEv_bicycle
the 
back 
tire 
because 
the 
back 
tire 
supports UnrelEv_bicycle
most 
of 
your 
weight 
on 
a 
bicycle 
. 
so 
you 
'll 
need UnrelEv_bicycle
a 
wrench 
to 
undo ScrEv_loose_nut
the 
bolts 
on 
both 
sides 
of 
the 
tire 
. 
this 
will 
allow UnrelEv_bicycle
you 
to 
take+off ScrEv_free_wheel
the 
entire 
tire 
. 
inside 
the 
tire 
is UnrelEv_bicycle
an 
innertube 
, 
and 
this 
is UnrelEv_bicycle
the 
part 
you 
either 
need 
to 
replace ScrEv_put_new_tire
or 
patch+up ScrEv_put_patch/seal
. 
if 
it 
is UnrelEv_bicycle
a 
small 
hole 
and 
you 
can 
easily 
find RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
hole 
, 
you 
can 
use UnrelEv_bicycle
a 
tire 
patch 
kit 
to 
fix ScrEv_put_patch/seal
the 
hole 
. 
other 
wise 
you 
may UnrelEv_bicycle
just 
replace ScrEv_put_new_tire
the 
entire 
innertube 
altogether 
. 
either 
way 
you 
will 
put ScrEv_put_new_tire
the 
innertube 
back 
, 
and 
then 
the 
tire 
back 
onto 
the 
bike 
frame 
. 
lastly 
, 
screw RelNScrEv_bicycle
back 
on 
the 
bolts 
and 
pump ScrEv_refill_tire_air
some 
air 
into 
the 
tire 
. 
you 
'll 
be UnrelEv_bicycle
ready 
to 
ride ScrEv_ride_bike
soon 
after 
! 
<end_of_story>_bicycle 
i 
was 
riding ScrEv_ride_bike
my 
bike 
around 
my 
house 
and 
noticed ScrEv_notice_problem
i 
had 
to 
peddle UnrelEv_bicycle
harder 
than 
i 
usually 
do UnrelEv_bicycle
. 
i 
got ScrEv_get_off
off 
my 
bike 
to 
see ScrEv_examine_tire
if 
everything 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
wrong 
. 
the 
front 
tire 
looked UnrelEv_bicycle
okay 
, 
the 
chain 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
still 
on 
the 
bike 
, 
but 
the 
back 
tire 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
flat 
unfortunately 
. 
i 
walked RelNScrEv_bicycle
my 
bike 
back 
to 
my 
house 
because 
it 
is UnrelEv_bicycle
not 
safe 
to 
ride ScrEv_ride_bike
a 
bike 
with 
a 
flat 
tire 
. 
i 
went RelNScrEv_bicycle
in 
my 
garage 
and 
looked RelNScrEv_bicycle
for 
the 
air 
pump 
. 
i 
connected RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
valve 
of 
the 
pump 
to 
the 
valve 
on 
the 
tire 
. 
i 
pumped ScrEv_refill_tire_air
the 
air 
pump 
and 
kept 
checking RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
tire 
to 
make+sure UnrelEv_bicycle
it 
was 
working UnrelEv_bicycle
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
hard 
work 
and 
it 
took UnrelEv_bicycle
longer 
than 
i 
thought UnrelEv_bicycle
. 
eventually 
, 
the 
tire 
seemed UnrelEv_bicycle
full 
with 
air 
. 
i 
put UnrelEv_bicycle
my 
ear 
next 
to 
it 
to 
see ScrEv_check_new_tire
if 
i 
could 
hear UnrelEv_bicycle
any 
air 
coming+out UnrelEv_bicycle
but 
i 
did 
n't 
hear UnrelEv_bicycle
any 
. 
i 
got RelNScrEv_bicycle
back 
on 
my 
bike 
and 
it 
rode ScrEv_ride_bike
fine 
. 
<end_of_story>_bicycle 
in 
a 
couple 
days 
, 
me 
and 
some 
friends 
were 
going 
to 
celebrate UnrelEv_bicycle
the 
good 
weather 
by 
going UnrelEv_bicycle
biking ScrEv_ride_bike
. 
i 
had UnrelEv_bicycle
my 
bike 
sit UnrelEv_bicycle
in 
my 
garage 
for 
a 
couple 
years 
not 
using UnrelEv_bicycle
it 
. 
so 
when 
i 
decided UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
get UnrelEv_bicycle
it 
out 
, 
to 
my 
surprise 
it 
had UnrelEv_bicycle
flat 
tires 
. 
i 
struggled UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
get UnrelEv_bicycle
the 
bike 
out 
of 
the 
garage 
with 
all 
the 
other 
junk 
in 
it 
, 
and 
found RelNScrEv_bicycle
my 
tire 
pump 
along 
with 
it 
. 
after 
i 
got UnrelEv_bicycle
my 
bike 
out 
, 
i 
kneeled UnrelEv_bicycle
near 
the 
bike 
and 
found RelNScrEv_bicycle
cap 
for 
the 
tire 
. 
i 
unscrewed ScrEv_pull_air_pin
it 
with 
a 
pair 
of 
pliers 
because 
it 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
on 
tight 
. 
i 
plugged RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
hose 
into 
the 
tire 
and 
started UnrelEv_bicycle
pumping ScrEv_refill_tire_air
until 
it 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
at 
a 
good 
level 
. 
i 
quickly 
unplugged RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
air 
pump 
and 
screwed RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
cap 
back 
on 
. 
after 
this 
i 
moved UnrelEv_bicycle
over 
to 
the 
rear 
tire 
, 
and 
repeated UnrelEv_bicycle
the 
same 
process 
to 
fix+my+flat+bicycle+tire Evoking_bicycle
. 
<end_of_story>_bicycle 
as 
an 
avid 
mountain 
biker 
, 
i 
have 
found UnrelEv_bicycle
myself 
in 
many 
precarious 
situations 
. 
from 
run 
ins 
with 
bears 
, 
to 
falling UnrelEv_bicycle
into 
prickly 
bushes 
. 
it 
is UnrelEv_bicycle
always 
an 
adventure 
when 
you 
are 
riding ScrEv_ride_bike
your 
mountain 
bike 
through 
the 
great 
outdoors 
. 
one 
particular 
issue 
that 
affects UnrelEv_bicycle
all 
mountain 
bikers 
, 
is UnrelEv_bicycle
flat 
tires 
. 
i 
have 
had UnrelEv_bicycle
numerous 
flat 
tires 
during 
my 
years 
riding ScrEv_ride_bike
. 
the 
first 
flat 
tire 
i 
ever 
had+left UnrelEv_bicycle
me 
stranded UnrelEv_bicycle
miles 
away 
form 
civilization 
. 
i 
had 
to 
hoof RelNScrEv_bicycle
it 
out 
on 
foot 
, 
carrying RelNScrEv_bicycle
a 
broken 
bike 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
an 
experience 
i 
did 
not 
want 
to 
relive UnrelEv_bicycle
again 
. 
from 
then 
on 
i 
purchased ScrEv_get_tools
and 
kept UnrelEv_bicycle
many 
bicycle 
tire 
tubes 
in 
my 
riding 
gear 
. 
to 
replace+a+bicycle+tire Evoking_bicycle
is UnrelEv_bicycle
now 
a 
simple 
process 
for 
me 
. 
you 
break RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
bead 
on 
the 
old 
tire 
shell 
and 
pull ScrEv_take_tire_off
it 
slightly 
to 
the 
side 
. 
you 
work ScrEv_take_tire_off
the 
tube 
out 
from 
between 
the 
rim 
and 
the 
tire 
itself 
. 
you 
then 
stuff ScrEv_put_new_tire
the 
new 
rubber 
tube 
where 
the 
old 
one 
was 
, 
making+sure RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
nipple 
matches UnrelEv_bicycle
with 
the 
nipple 
hole 
. 
you 
then 
move ScrEv_put_new_tire
the 
outer 
tire 
back 
into 
position 
and 
pump+up ScrEv_refill_tire_air
the 
tire 
. 
<end_of_story>_bicycle 
one 
day 
my 
bicycle 
tire 
got RelNScrEv_bicycle
flat 
due 
to 
hitting RelNScrEv_bicycle
some 
glass 
in 
the 
street 
. 
i 
then 
had 
to 
walk RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
rest 
of 
the 
way 
home 
. 
i 
took RelNScrEv_bicycle
it 
into 
my 
garage 
and 
tried UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
repair+it Evoking_bicycle
by 
putting ScrEv_put_patch/seal
some 
duct 
tape 
on 
it 
and 
pumping ScrEv_refill_tire_air
it 
with 
air 
. 
this 
, 
however 
, 
only 
made UnrelEv_bicycle
matters 
worst 
and 
all 
the 
air 
ended+up+making UnrelEv_bicycle
another 
hole 
in 
my 
tire 
because 
i 
over+inflated RelNScrEv_bicycle
it 
. 
i 
decided UnrelEv_bicycle
that 
i 
had UnrelEv_bicycle
no 
other 
options 
and 
i 
ordered ScrEv_get_tools
a 
new 
tire 
on 
amazon 
for 
my 
bike 
. 
once 
that 
came UnrelEv_bicycle
in 
the 
mail 
it 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
time 
to 
repair+my+broken+bike Evoking_bicycle
. 
i 
got ScrEv_get_tools
a 
socket 
wrench 
and 
unscrewed ScrEv_loose_nut
the 
nut 
of 
the 
bike 
that 
attached UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
the 
wheel 
. 
after 
that 
i 
got ScrEv_get_tools
my 
new 
bike 
tire 
and 
put ScrEv_put_new_tire
it 
on 
the 
frame 
of 
the 
bike 
and 
screwed ScrEv_other_bicycle
it 
back 
on 
. 
once 
that 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
complete 
my 
bike 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
as 
good 
as 
new 
and 
i 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
back 
to 
riding ScrEv_ride_bike
my 
daily 
bike 
trail 
by 
my 
house 
. 
<end_of_story>_bicycle 
it 
's UnrelEv_bicycle
a 
major 
bummer 
when 
you 
are UnrelEv_bicycle
excited 
to 
ride ScrEv_ride_bike
your 
bike 
only 
to 
find ScrEv_notice_problem
that 
you 
have 
somehow 
ended+up UnrelEv_bicycle
with 
a 
flat 
tire 
. 
i 
try 
to 
keep UnrelEv_bicycle
a 
repair 
kit 
on 
hand 
for 
just 
such 
an 
opportunity 
. 
the 
first 
thing 
i 
do+is UnrelEv_bicycle
determine ScrEv_examine_tire
what 
is UnrelEv_bicycle
the 
cause 
of 
the 
flat 
. 
perhaps 
the 
tire 
has 
been 
punctured RelNScrEv_bicycle
, 
or 
perhaps 
it 
is UnrelEv_bicycle
an 
older 
tire 
and 
the 
seal 
is 
failing RelNScrEv_bicycle
. 
if 
it 
is UnrelEv_bicycle
a 
puncture 
, 
i 
would 
do UnrelEv_bicycle
my 
best 
to 
seal ScrEv_put_patch/seal
the 
hole 
with 
my 
available 
materials 
and 
then 
allow UnrelEv_bicycle
the 
sealant 
to 
dry RelNScrEv_bicycle
for 
as 
long 
as 
is+required UnrelEv_bicycle
. 
i 
have UnrelEv_bicycle
my 
tire 
pump 
on 
hand 
, 
so 
when 
the 
tire 
is UnrelEv_bicycle
ready 
i 
can 
slowly 
pump ScrEv_refill_tire_air
air 
while 
also 
watching ScrEv_check_new_tire
to 
see ScrEv_check_new_tire
if 
i 
am 
losing UnrelEv_bicycle
air 
. 
if 
the 
seal 
holds UnrelEv_bicycle
, 
my 
bike 
is UnrelEv_bicycle
good 
to 
go UnrelEv_bicycle
. 
if 
i 
still 
feel ScrEv_check_new_tire
or 
see ScrEv_check_new_tire
a 
leak 
, 
i 
know UnrelEv_bicycle
there 
is UnrelEv_bicycle
a 
bigger 
issue 
to 
contend UnrelEv_bicycle
with 
. 
<end_of_story>_bicycle 
carrying UnrelEv_bicycle
a 
spare 
inner 
tube 
saves UnrelEv_bicycle
lots 
of 
time 
and 
trouble 
, 
since 
i 
have 
to 
carry UnrelEv_bicycle
a 
patch 
kit 
anyway 
. 
however 
, 
if 
i 
do 
n't 
have UnrelEv_bicycle
one 
, 
i 
can 
still 
fix+a+flat Evoking_bicycle
. 
first 
i 
turn RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
bike 
over 
, 
and 
remove RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
brake 
by 
opening RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
quick 
release 
lever 
. 
then 
i 
remove ScrEv_take_tire_off
the 
tire 
with 
its 
quick 
release 
lever 
. 
now 
i 
inspect ScrEv_examine_tire
the 
outside 
of 
the 
tire 
, 
to 
try UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
find ScrEv_examine_tire
the 
source 
of 
the 
problem 
. 
i 
look ScrEv_examine_tire
for 
imbedded 
glass 
, 
thorns 
, 
cuts 
or 
tears 
. 
if 
i 
find RelNScrEv_bicycle
a 
foreign 
object 
, 
i 
remove RelNScrEv_bicycle
it 
. 
then 
i 
take ScrEv_take_tire_off
the 
tire 
off 
. 
i 
deflate RelNScrEv_bicycle
it 
, 
and 
push RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
side 
of 
the 
tire 
towards 
the 
middle 
, 
trying UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
expose ScrEv_take_tire_off
the 
tube 
. 
if 
that 
fails UnrelEv_bicycle
, 
i 
use UnrelEv_bicycle
tire 
irons 
, 
if 
i 
have UnrelEv_bicycle
them 
. 
i 
shove RelNScrEv_bicycle
one 
in 
on 
the 
opposite 
side 
of 
the 
wheel 
form 
the 
valve 
, 
and 
lever RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
edge 
of 
the 
tire 
out 
of 
the 
rim 
. 
then 
i 
put+in RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
next 
tire 
iron 
about 
three 
spokes 
away 
and 
try UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
lift RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
section 
of 
tire 
in 
between 
up 
and 
away 
from 
the 
rim 
. 
this 
makes UnrelEv_bicycle
it 
possible 
to 
take ScrEv_take_tire_off
the 
whole 
tire 
out 
and 
remove ScrEv_remove_tire
it 
. 
i 
look ScrEv_examine_tire
for 
the 
leak 
inside 
the 
tire 
, 
and 
then 
on 
the 
tube 
. 
i 
deflate RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
tube 
by 
pushing RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
valve 
center 
until 
i 
hear UnrelEv_bicycle
air 
hiss UnrelEv_bicycle
. 
if 
i 
can 
not 
find RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
leak 
, 
i 
put RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
tube 
in 
a 
bucket 
of 
water 
and 
look ScrEv_examine_tire
for 
bubbles 
. 
if 
i 
can 
not 
do UnrelEv_bicycle
that 
, 
i 
listen RelNScrEv_bicycle
, 
and 
then 
i 
look ScrEv_examine_tire
around 
the 
valve 
. 
i 
also 
inspect ScrEv_examine_tire
the 
inside 
of 
the 
tire 
. 
now 
, 
i 
need UnrelEv_bicycle
a 
patch 
kit 
. 
i 
clean RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
outside 
of 
the 
tire 
near 
the 
leak 
as 
much 
as 
i 
can UnrelEv_bicycle
. 
then 
i 
roughen RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
area 
with 
the 
scratchy 
thing 
provided UnrelEv_bicycle
. 
i 
spread RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
foul-smelling UnrelEv_bicycle
glue 
, 
let UnrelEv_bicycle
it 
dry RelNScrEv_bicycle
until 
it 
is UnrelEv_bicycle
tacky 
, 
and 
press+on ScrEv_put_patch/seal
the 
patch 
, 
starting UnrelEv_bicycle
at 
its 
center 
, 
and 
being UnrelEv_bicycle
careful 
not 
to 
glue UnrelEv_bicycle
the 
tire 
to 
itself 
. 
now 
i 
partially 
re-inflate ScrEv_refill_tire_air
the 
tube 
, 
and 
replace ScrEv_put_new_tire
it 
in 
the 
tire 
, 
making+sure UnrelEv_bicycle
the 
spoke 
cushion 
stays UnrelEv_bicycle
in 
place 
. 
i 
put ScrEv_put_new_tire
the 
tire 
on 
the 
wheel 
, 
and 
check ScrEv_check_new_tire
to 
see UnrelEv_bicycle
that 
the 
valve 
is 
pointed UnrelEv_bicycle
straight 
to 
the 
center 
. 
i 
re-inflate ScrEv_refill_tire_air
the 
tube 
, 
and 
then 
replace ScrEv_other_bicycle
the 
wheel 
and 
reattach RelNScrEv_bicycle
it 
and 
reattach RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
brake 
. 
and 
i 
turn RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
bike 
over 
again 
and 
ride ScrEv_ride_bike
. 
<end_of_story>_bicycle 
when 
i 
was 
riding ScrEv_ride_bike
my 
bike 
this 
past 
summer 
, 
one 
of 
my 
tires 
went RelNScrEv_bicycle
flat 
. 
i 
noticed ScrEv_notice_problem
it 
went RelNScrEv_bicycle
flat 
because 
it 
felt ScrEv_notice_problem
bumpy 
while 
i 
was 
riding ScrEv_ride_bike
down 
the 
street 
. 
i 
wheeled ScrEv_get_off
my 
bike 
home 
while 
walking RelNScrEv_bicycle
next 
to 
it 
and 
pushing RelNScrEv_bicycle
it 
. 
i 
asked RelNScrEv_bicycle
my 
dad 
to 
help UnrelEv_bicycle
me 
fix+the+flat+tire Evoking_bicycle
because 
i 
had 
never 
done UnrelEv_bicycle
it 
before 
. 
he 
gave ScrEv_get_tools
me 
the 
materials 
i 
needed UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
fix+it Evoking_bicycle
, 
and 
he 
explained RelNScrEv_bicycle
how 
to 
go UnrelEv_bicycle
about 
fixing+it Evoking_bicycle
. 
to 
my 
surprise 
, 
it 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
very 
easy 
to 
fix+the+flat+tire Evoking_bicycle
. 
i 
just 
had 
to 
patch+up ScrEv_put_patch/seal
the 
hole 
with 
the 
materials 
he 
gave ScrEv_get_tools
me 
. 
after 
i 
patched+up ScrEv_put_patch/seal
the 
hole 
, 
i 
used RelNScrEv_bicycle
an 
air 
pump 
to 
put ScrEv_refill_tire_air
air 
in 
both 
of 
my 
tires 
. 
this 
completed UnrelEv_bicycle
the 
repair 
process 
for 
me 
. 
the 
next 
day 
, 
i 
rode ScrEv_ride_bike
my 
bike 
again 
and 
i 
did 
not 
have RelNScrEv_bicycle
any 
problems 
with 
the 
tire 
. 
<end_of_story>_bicycle 
my 
sister 
jane 
and 
i 
love UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
go UnrelEv_bicycle
bicycling ScrEv_ride_bike
. 
one 
warm 
day 
in 
june 
, 
we 
wanted UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
go UnrelEv_bicycle
out 
and 
ride ScrEv_ride_bike
but 
my 
bike 
had ScrEv_notice_problem
a 
flat 
tire 
. 
i 
carefully 
took ScrEv_take_tire_off
the 
tire 
off 
of 
the 
rim 
and 
then 
inflated ScrEv_examine_tire
it 
with 
a 
hand 
pump 
so 
i 
could 
find ScrEv_examine_tire
the 
leak 
. 
a 
blast 
of 
cool 
air 
on 
my 
fingers 
led ScrEv_examine_tire
me 
to 
the 
problem 
: 
a 
single 
round 
hole 
, 
probably 
caused UnrelEv_bicycle
by 
a 
nail 
or 
other 
sharp 
object 
. 
i 
got+out ScrEv_get_tools
my 
patch 
kit 
, 
and 
jane 
held+up RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
tire 
for 
me 
as 
i 
first 
applied ScrEv_put_patch/seal
glue 
and 
then 
placed ScrEv_put_patch/seal
a 
patch 
carefully 
over 
the 
damaged RelNScrEv_bicycle
area 
. 
i 
had 
to 
let UnrelEv_bicycle
it 
dry RelNScrEv_bicycle
, 
so 
we 
took UnrelEv_bicycle
turns 
riding RelNScrEv_bicycle
jane 
's 
bike 
for 
a 
while 
. 
then 
i 
inflated ScrEv_refill_tire_air
the 
tire 
and 
checked ScrEv_check_new_tire
the 
patch 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
good 
! 
the 
leak 
was 
repaired Evoking_bicycle
. 
i 
put ScrEv_put_new_tire
the 
tire 
back 
on 
my 
bike 
and 
we 
went+off ScrEv_ride_bike
on 
a 
nice 
long 
ride 
. 
i 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
happy 
to 
have 
my 
bike 
fixed Evoking_bicycle
again 
. 
<end_of_story>_bicycle 
i 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
about 
to 
go ScrEv_ride_bike
for 
a 
bicycle 
ride 
, 
but 
when 
i 
went RelNScrEv_bicycle
to 
the 
garage 
to 
get RelNScrEv_bicycle
my 
bike 
i 
realized ScrEv_notice_problem
the 
tire 
was+completely+flat Evoking_bicycle
. 
luckily 
i 
was 
prepared RelNScrEv_bicycle
for 
just 
such 
an 
event 
. 
i 
went RelNScrEv_bicycle
to 
a 
shelf 
and 
found ScrEv_get_tools
my 
bicycle 
repair 
kit 
. 
then 
i 
took ScrEv_examine_tire
a 
close 
look 
at 
the 
bicycle 
tire 
. 
if 
i 
could 
n't 
find ScrEv_examine_tire
the 
leak 
, 
i 
could 
always 
fill RelNScrEv_bicycle
a 
tub 
with 
water 
, 
put RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
tire 
under 
the 
water 
and 
see ScrEv_examine_tire
where 
the 
bubbles 
come+out RelNScrEv_bicycle
. 
luckily 
the 
leak 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
obvious 
. 
i 
applied ScrEv_put_patch/seal
some 
adhesive 
from 
the 
kit 
and 
put+on ScrEv_put_patch/seal
a 
rubber 
patch 
. 
then 
i 
got+down ScrEv_get_tools
my 
bicycle 
pump 
. 
i 
hooked ScrEv_pull_air_pin
the 
hose 
up 
to 
the 
nipple 
on 
the 
tire 
and 
then 
pumped ScrEv_refill_tire_air
up 
and 
down 
vigorously 
for 
a 
few 
minutes 
. 
i 
felt ScrEv_check_new_tire
the 
tire 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
nice 
and 
firm 
. 
success 
! 
i 
put+away ScrEv_other_bicycle
the 
pump 
and 
kit 
and 
hopped+on ScrEv_ride_bike
for 
my 
bike 
ride 
. 
<end_of_story>_bicycle 
i 
recently 
got+a+flat+bicycle+tire Evoking_bicycle
while 
riding ScrEv_ride_bike
home 
from 
work 
. 
as 
soon 
as 
i 
got RelNScrEv_bicycle
home 
, 
i 
removed ScrEv_remove_tire
the 
tire 
from 
the 
bike 
and 
checked ScrEv_check_new_tire
for 
the 
cause 
. 
sure 
enough 
, 
there 
was RelNScrEv_bicycle
a 
small 
puncture 
, 
i 
must 
have 
run RelNScrEv_bicycle
over 
something 
sharp 
while 
commuting ScrEv_ride_bike
home 
. 
i 
then 
went RelNScrEv_bicycle
to 
the 
local 
bike 
shop 
and 
the 
man 
at 
the 
shop 
recommended RelNScrEv_bicycle
that 
i 
buy ScrEv_get_tools
a 
patch 
kit 
, 
since 
doing UnrelEv_bicycle
so 
is UnrelEv_bicycle
much 
cheaper 
than 
replacing+the+entire+tube Evoking_bicycle
. 
the 
patch 
kit 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
very 
easy 
to 
use UnrelEv_bicycle
as 
the 
instructions 
were UnrelEv_bicycle
very 
details 
. 
first 
i 
added ScrEv_put_patch/seal
glue 
to 
the 
area 
and 
then 
put ScrEv_put_patch/seal
the 
patch 
on 
top 
. 
after 
holding RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
patch 
in 
place 
for 
a 
few 
minutes 
, 
i 
added RelNScrEv_bicycle
a 
little 
talc 
. 
i 
also 
added RelNScrEv_bicycle
a 
little 
talc 
to 
the 
inside 
of 
the 
tire 
. 
once 
everything 
was 
set RelNScrEv_bicycle
, 
i 
put ScrEv_put_new_tire
the 
wheel 
back 
on 
the 
bike 
and 
everything 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
good 
as 
new 
. 
<end_of_story>_bicycle 
my 
friend 
adam 
and 
i 
decided UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
go UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
the 
flea 
market 
today 
because 
the 
weather 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
nice 
and 
we 
were 
hoping UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
take UnrelEv_bicycle
some 
random 
junk 
home 
with 
us 
. 
we 
walked UnrelEv_bicycle
around 
for 
a 
while 
, 
but 
nothing 
really 
caught UnrelEv_bicycle
our 
attention 
. 
we 
were 
looking+for UnrelEv_bicycle
something 
special 
amount 
all 
this 
junk 
. 
suddenly 
something 
caught UnrelEv_bicycle
my 
eye 
, 
it 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
an 
old 
schwinn 
with 
a 
flat 
tire 
. 
the 
price 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
right 
so 
i 
decided UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
take UnrelEv_bicycle
it 
home 
with 
me 
. 
fixing+the+flat+tire Evoking_bicycle
was UnrelEv_bicycle
a 
trivial 
task 
, 
i 
could 
do UnrelEv_bicycle
it 
in 
my 
sleep 
. 
all 
i 
had 
to 
do+was UnrelEv_bicycle
remove RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
brakes 
off 
the 
back 
wheel 
, 
then 
i 
needed 
to 
remove ScrEv_free_wheel
the 
wheel 
from 
the 
axle 
, 
next 
i 
would 
take ScrEv_take_tire_off
the 
old 
tube 
off 
of 
the 
rim 
and 
replace ScrEv_put_new_tire
it 
with 
the 
new 
one 
, 
lastly 
i 
would 
just 
put ScrEv_put_new_tire
the 
tire 
back 
on 
the 
axle 
and 
reattach RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
brakes 
. 
with 
this 
little 
amount 
of 
effort 
i 
would 
have UnrelEv_bicycle
myself 
a 
brand 
new 
schwinn 
. 
<end_of_story>_bicycle 
yesterday 
i 
was 
riding ScrEv_ride_bike
around 
my 
neighborhood 
on 
my 
bicycle 
when 
i 
drove ScrEv_notice_problem
over 
a 
rusty 
nail 
hiding UnrelEv_bicycle
between 
the 
bricks 
on 
the 
sidewalk 
. 
i 
had 
to 
walk ScrEv_get_off
my 
bike 
home 
. 
today 
, 
i 
went RelNScrEv_bicycle
to 
the 
store 
to 
buy ScrEv_get_tools
a 
flat 
tire 
repair 
kit 
. 
i 
took ScrEv_remove_tire
the 
tire 
off 
the 
bike 
and 
located ScrEv_examine_tire
the 
nail 
so 
i 
could 
remove RelNScrEv_bicycle
it 
. 
after 
removing RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
nail 
, 
i 
let RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
remainder 
of 
the 
air 
out 
of 
the 
tire 
. 
the 
next 
step 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
pry ScrEv_take_tire_off
the 
tire 
off 
of 
the 
rim 
. 
i 
got ScrEv_get_tools
my 
flat 
head 
screwdriver 
and 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
able 
to 
separate ScrEv_take_tire_off
the 
rim 
from 
the 
tire 
and 
inner 
tube 
. 
i 
pumped ScrEv_examine_tire
just 
enough 
air 
to 
find ScrEv_examine_tire
the 
leak 
in 
my 
tire 
where 
the 
nail 
had 
penetrated RelNScrEv_bicycle
. 
after 
finding ScrEv_examine_tire
the 
hole 
, 
i 
buffed RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
area 
the 
hole 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
at 
and 
applied ScrEv_put_patch/seal
glue 
to 
it 
. 
then 
i 
put ScrEv_put_patch/seal
a 
tire 
patch 
over 
the 
glue 
and 
let UnrelEv_bicycle
it 
sit RelNScrEv_bicycle
for 
a 
few 
minutes 
. 
i 
put ScrEv_put_new_tire
the 
inner 
tube 
and 
tire 
back 
on 
the 
rim 
, 
and 
pumped ScrEv_refill_tire_air
my 
tire 
up 
with 
air 
. 
<end_of_story>_bicycle 
when 
riding ScrEv_ride_bike
bikes 
, 
sometimes 
the 
tires 
will 
go+flat Evoking_bicycle
. 
this 
can 
happen UnrelEv_bicycle
either 
because 
you 
ran RelNScrEv_bicycle
over 
something 
and 
there 
is UnrelEv_bicycle
a 
hole 
, 
or 
because 
the 
tire 
is 
leaking RelNScrEv_bicycle
air 
somewhere 
. 
sometimes 
you 
can 
just 
get ScrEv_get_tools
a 
pump 
and 
refill ScrEv_refill_tire_air
the 
tire 
with 
air 
, 
and 
sometimes 
you 
need 
to 
replace+the+entire+thing Evoking_bicycle
. 
there 
is UnrelEv_bicycle
this 
stuff 
that 
i 
have 
used UnrelEv_bicycle
before 
that 
worked RelNScrEv_bicycle
for 
small 
holes 
though 
, 
it 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
like 
this 
foam 
stuff 
that 
is UnrelEv_bicycle
in 
a 
bottle 
. 
you 
just 
spray ScrEv_put_patch/seal
it 
in 
and 
let UnrelEv_bicycle
it 
sit RelNScrEv_bicycle
for 
a 
little 
bit 
. 
the 
foam 
closes RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
hole 
up 
and 
you 
can 
refill ScrEv_refill_tire_air
the 
tire 
and 
everything 
works RelNScrEv_bicycle
again 
if 
the 
hole 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
n't 
a 
bad 
one 
. 
if 
the 
tire 
is 
too 
far 
gone RelNScrEv_bicycle
, 
you 
wo 
n't 
be UnrelEv_bicycle
able 
to 
repair+it Evoking_bicycle
with 
anything 
and 
will 
end+up UnrelEv_bicycle
replacing+the+whole+thing Evoking_bicycle
or 
risk UnrelEv_bicycle
riding ScrEv_ride_bike
on 
the 
metal 
rims 
which 
can 
seriously 
damage UnrelEv_bicycle
your 
bike 
. 
<end_of_story>_bicycle 
i 
went ScrEv_ride_bike
on 
a 
bike 
ride 
in 
the 
afternoon 
yesterday 
, 
the 
weather 
had UnrelEv_bicycle
an 
amazing 
break 
of 
sunlight 
, 
and 
i 
had 
to 
take UnrelEv_bicycle
advantage 
of 
it 
. 
gearing+up UnrelEv_bicycle
for 
the 
bike 
ride 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
n't 
very 
time 
consuming UnrelEv_bicycle
, 
it 
only 
took UnrelEv_bicycle
about 
523 
minutes 
to 
change UnrelEv_bicycle
, 
grab UnrelEv_bicycle
my 
helmet 
, 
and 
fill UnrelEv_bicycle
a 
water 
bottle 
from 
the 
sink 
. 
i 
left UnrelEv_bicycle
home 
, 
and 
progressed ScrEv_ride_bike
close 
to 
523 
miles 
before 
i 
heard ScrEv_notice_problem
a 
low 
hiss 
escape RelNScrEv_bicycle
from 
somewhere 
below 
where 
my 
feet 
were UnrelEv_bicycle
. 
i 
almost 
knew ScrEv_notice_problem
immediately 
that 
it 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
going 
to 
be+a+flat+tire Evoking_bicycle
. 
i 
had 
my 
friend 
pick ScrEv_get_off
me 
up 
, 
they 
helped UnrelEv_bicycle
get RelNScrEv_bicycle
me 
home 
without 
further 
incident 
. 
after 
getting ScrEv_lay_bike_down
my 
bike 
up 
on 
it 
's 
stand 
, 
i 
began UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
peel ScrEv_take_tire_off
the 
bad 
tire 
off 
the 
rim 
, 
finding ScrEv_examine_tire
the 
tube 
had RelNScrEv_bicycle
a 
small 
puncture 
. 
i 
decided UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
to 
replace ScrEv_put_new_tire
the 
tube 
entirely 
, 
and 
fitted ScrEv_put_new_tire
the 
tube 
and 
tire 
back 
onto

<end_of_story>_bicycle 
as 
i 
was 
bring RelNScrEv_bicycle
my 
bike 
out 
of 
the 
garage 
i 
realized ScrEv_notice_problem
the 
rear 
tire 
had RelNScrEv_bicycle
flat 
and 
there 
was RelNScrEv_bicycle
clearly 
a 
small 
hissing RelNScrEv_bicycle
sound 
where 
there 
was RelNScrEv_bicycle
a 
puncture 
. 
i 
got ScrEv_get_tools
my 
tools 
and 
loosened ScrEv_loose_nut
and 
removed ScrEv_loose_nut
the 
nuts 
holding RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
tire 
on 
the 
bike 
. 
using RelNScrEv_bicycle
a 
screwdriver 
i 
wedged RelNScrEv_bicycle
underneath 
the 
tire 
removing ScrEv_take_tire_off
it 
from 
the 
metal 
wheel 
. 
i 
removed ScrEv_remove_tire
the 
tire 
tube 
and 
cleaned+off RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
punctured RelNScrEv_bicycle
area 
with 
a 
dry 
cloth 
. 
i 
put ScrEv_put_patch/seal
tire 
repair 
glue 
on 
the 
hole 
and 
placed ScrEv_put_patch/seal
a 
tire 
patch 
on 
the 
glue 
and 
held RelNScrEv_bicycle
it 
tight 
for 
several 
minutes 
until 
the 
glue 
dried RelNScrEv_bicycle
. 
i 
filled ScrEv_refill_tire_air
it 
up 
to 
ensure ScrEv_check_new_tire
the 
hole 
was 
not 
leaking RelNScrEv_bicycle
any 
air 
. 
i 
put ScrEv_put_new_tire
the 
tube 
back 
in 
the 
tire 
and 
re-attached ScrEv_put_new_tire
it 
to 
the 
wheel 
tightening RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
bolts 
. 
again 
i 
filled ScrEv_refill_tire_air
the 
tire 
with 
air 
and 
took ScrEv_ride_bike
my 
bike 
for 
a

<end_of_story>_bicycle 
when 
you 
have+a+flat+bicycle+tire Evoking_bicycle
the 
first 
thing 
you 
need 
to 
do+is UnrelEv_bicycle
see ScrEv_examine_tire
where 
the 
hole 
is 
originating RelNScrEv_bicycle
from 
. 
you 
have 
to 
fully 
unscrew ScrEv_loose_nut
the 
tire 
first 
and 
take+off ScrEv_take_tire_off
the

to 
take+off ScrEv_take_tire_off

off 
of 
the

once

have UnrelEv_bicycle
the

try UnrelEv_bicycle
to

the

listening ScrEv_examine_tire

another 
method 
is UnrelEv_bicycle
filling RelNScrEv_bicycle
a

once 
the

you 
have 
to

<end_of_story>_bicycle 
i 
recently 
started UnrelEv_bicycle
biking ScrEv_ride_bike
to 
lose UnrelEv_bicycle
weight 
and 
for 
health 
. 
after 
a 
month 
of 
biking ScrEv_ride_bike
everyday 
, 
my 
bike 
hit ScrEv_notice_problem
a 
nail 
in 
the 
road 
which 
i 
think+is UnrelEv_bicycle
pretty 
dangerous 
. 
what 
if 
a 
kid 
was 
playing UnrelEv_bicycle
? 
i 
was 
pretty 
devastated UnrelEv_bicycle
. 
because 
of 
the 
expenses 
with 
school 
, 
i 
would 
not 
be UnrelEv_bicycle
able 
to 
afford RelNScrEv_bicycle
a 
new 
tire 
. 
so 
i 
thought UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
myself 
, 
maybe 
i 
can 
fix+it Evoking_bicycle
. 
i 
resolved UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
fix+it Evoking_bicycle
this 
sunday 
, 
because 
i 
figured UnrelEv_bicycle
friday 
and 
saturday 
would 
be UnrelEv_bicycle
too 
busy 
. 
i 
've 
never 
repaired+a+bike+tire Evoking_bicycle
before 
. 
so 
i 
searched RelNScrEv_bicycle
google 
for 
some 
tutorials 
. 
turns UnrelEv_bicycle
out 
, 
i 
can 
just 
use RelNScrEv_bicycle
a 
sticky 
material 
to 
cover ScrEv_put_patch/seal
the 
part 
that 
's 
broken RelNScrEv_bicycle
. 
i 
looked RelNScrEv_bicycle
at 
various 
online 
store 
. 
no 
one 
seemed UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
have RelNScrEv_bicycle
it 
. 
just 
my 
luck 
. 
then 
it 
occurred UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
me 
that 
maybe 
an 
automotive 
store 
would 
have RelNScrEv_bicycle
it 
, 
and 
they 
did UnrelEv_bicycle
! 
it 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
only 
$ 
523 
. 
stuck ScrEv_put_patch/seal
it 
in 
and 
inflated ScrEv_refill_tire_air
my 
tire 
. 
it 
's 
been 
working UnrelEv_bicycle
for 
months 
ever 
since 
! 
<end_of_story>_bicycle 
once 
, 
when 
i 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
523 
, 
i 
had 
a 
flat+bicycle+tire Evoking_bicycle
. 
i 
had 
ridden ScrEv_ride_bike
over 
a 
nail 
and 
my 
tire 
was 
punctured RelNScrEv_bicycle
and 
my 
tube 
popped RelNScrEv_bicycle
. 
in 
order 
to 
fix+it Evoking_bicycle
my 
brother 
took RelNScrEv_bicycle
me 
the 
store 
so 
i 
could 
buy RelNScrEv_bicycle
a 
patch 
to 
fix+the+tire Evoking_bicycle
. 
once 
we 
got RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
patch 
, 
we 
went RelNScrEv_bicycle
back 
to 
the 
house 
. 
in 
order 
to 
find ScrEv_examine_tire
the 
hole 
we 
filled RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
tub 
with 
water 
and 
put RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
tube 
in 
. 
we 
looked RelNScrEv_bicycle
to 
see ScrEv_examine_tire
where 
bubbles 
came+out RelNScrEv_bicycle
; 
where 
the 
bubbles 
came+out RelNScrEv_bicycle
told ScrEv_examine_tire
us 
where 
the 
hole 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
. 
once 
we 
noted ScrEv_examine_tire
the 
location 
of 
the 
hole 
we 
took RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
tube 
out 
of 
the 
tub 
and 
dried RelNScrEv_bicycle
it 
. 
to 
put+on ScrEv_put_patch/seal
the 
patch 
we 
had 
to 
put RelNScrEv_bicycle
a 
glue 
on 
the 
tube 
and 
then 
put+on ScrEv_put_patch/seal
the 
patch 
. 
we 
held RelNScrEv_bicycle
it 
there 
a 
few 
minutes 
to 
make+sure UnrelEv_bicycle
it 
would 
stay RelNScrEv_bicycle
, 
then 
we 
let UnrelEv_bicycle
it 
sit RelNScrEv_bicycle
for 
an 
hour 
to 
make+sure UnrelEv_bicycle
the 
glue 
would 
dry RelNScrEv_bicycle
. 
to 
make+sure UnrelEv_bicycle
it 
dried RelNScrEv_bicycle
well 
we 
placed RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
tube 
out 
in 
the 
sun 
so 
the 
the 
heat 
could 
help RelNScrEv_bicycle
it 
along 
. 
to 
be UnrelEv_bicycle
safe 
we 
waited RelNScrEv_bicycle
a 
day 
. 
the 
next 
day 
we 
took RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
tube 
and 
put ScrEv_put_new_tire
it 
back 
in 
the 
tire 
, 
then 
we 
put ScrEv_put_new_tire
the 
tire 
on 
the 
wheel 
. 
my 
bike 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
good 
to 
ride ScrEv_ride_bike
again 
. 
<end_of_story>_bicycle 
in 
order 
for 
a 
bike 
to 
be UnrelEv_bicycle
rideable 
, 
its 
tires 
must 
be UnrelEv_bicycle
full 
of 
air 
. 
if 
you 
ride ScrEv_ride_bike
over 
a 
sharp 
thorn 
or 
rock 
, 
you 
might 
get UnrelEv_bicycle
unlucky 
, 
and 
pierce RelNScrEv_bicycle
one 
of 
your 
tires 
. 
the 
air 
will 
rush RelNScrEv_bicycle
out 
of 
the 
hole 
, 
and 
you 
will 
have+a+flat+tire Evoking_bicycle
, 
often 
just 
called UnrelEv_bicycle
, 
a 
flat 
. 
if 
this 
happens UnrelEv_bicycle
, 
you 
mus 
n't 
continue UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
ride ScrEv_ride_bike
; 
you 
need 
to 
stop ScrEv_get_off
somewhere 
, 
and 
repair+the+tire Evoking_bicycle
. 
first 
, 
you 
'll 
need 
to 
remove ScrEv_free_wheel
the 
wheel 
that 
has+the+flat+tire Evoking_bicycle
. 
it 
is UnrelEv_bicycle
usually 
easier 
to 
remove ScrEv_free_wheel
the 
front 
wheel 
than 
the 
back 
, 
because 
of 
the 
gears 
in 
back 
. 
once 
you 
have ScrEv_free_wheel
the 
damaged RelNScrEv_bicycle
wheel 
off 
the 
bike 
, 
you 
need 
to 
remove ScrEv_remove_tire
the 
tough 
outer 
part 
of 
the 
tire 
by 
prying ScrEv_remove_tire
it 
, 
little 
by 
little 
, 
off 
of 
the 
rim 
of 
the 
wheel 
. 
the 
hole 
in 
the 
tough 
tire 
is UnrelEv_bicycle
not 
actually 
the 
problem 
; 
it 
's UnrelEv_bicycle
the 
hole 
in 
the 
inner 
tube 
that 
must 
be 
repaired Evoking_bicycle
. 
once 
you 
've 
pried ScrEv_remove_tire
the 
tire 
off 
the 
rim 
, 
it 
is UnrelEv_bicycle
easy 
to 
pull+out ScrEv_take_tire_off
the 
floppy 
tube 
. 
now 
you 
have 
to 
locate ScrEv_examine_tire
the 
hole 
. 
sometimes 
the 
hole 
is UnrelEv_bicycle
very 
obvious 
, 
just 
by 
looking ScrEv_examine_tire
. 
other 
times 
, 
you 
can 
submerge RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
tube 
under 
water 
, 
and 
look+for ScrEv_examine_tire
bubbles 
. 
once 
found ScrEv_examine_tire
, 
the 
hole 
can 
be 
easily 
patched ScrEv_put_patch/seal
using RelNScrEv_bicycle
a 
patch 
kit 
. 
test ScrEv_check_new_tire
to 
make+sure UnrelEv_bicycle
the 
hole 
is 
totally 
sealed ScrEv_put_patch/seal
before 
reassembling ScrEv_put_new_tire
the 
wheel 
! 
if 
the 
repaired Evoking_bicycle
tube 
holds ScrEv_check_new_tire
air 
well 
, 
you 
can 
put ScrEv_put_new_tire
the 
tube 
in 
the 
tire 
, 
and 
get ScrEv_put_new_tire
them 
back 
onto 
the 
rim 
of 
the 
wheel 
. 
now 
, 
pedal ScrEv_ride_bike
fast 
, 
to 
make+up UnrelEv_bicycle
for 
lost 
time 
! 
<end_of_story>_bicycle 
i 
was 
riding ScrEv_ride_bike
in 
the 
bike 
lane 
going UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
work 
when 
i 
felt ScrEv_notice_problem
my 
tire 
pop RelNScrEv_bicycle
and 
give+out RelNScrEv_bicycle
on 
me 
. 
i 
quickly 
pulled+over RelNScrEv_bicycle
to 
the 
side 
walk 
and 
got+off ScrEv_get_off
my 
bike 
to 
take ScrEv_examine_tire
a 
good 
look 
at 
it 
. 
a 
rock 
was 
embedded RelNScrEv_bicycle
into 
my 
tire 
tube 
. 
i 
pried RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
rock 
out 
with 
my 
fingers 
and 
got ScrEv_get_tools
my 
patch 
kit 
from 
my 
backpack 
. 
i 
made+sure ScrEv_examine_tire
there 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
no 
other 
debris 
in 
the 
tire 
and 
then 
applied RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
glue 
. 
i 
stuck ScrEv_put_patch/seal
the 
patch 
onto 
the 
glue 
and 
made+sure UnrelEv_bicycle
it 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
a 
nice 
fit 
and 
held RelNScrEv_bicycle
well 
. 
after 
that 
i 
pumped ScrEv_refill_tire_air
my 
tire 
back 
up 
with 
air 
and 
checked ScrEv_check_new_tire
to 
make+sure UnrelEv_bicycle
it 
would 
hold+up RelNScrEv_bicycle
to 
the 
rigors 
of 
the 
road 
. 
after 
that 
i 
hopped ScrEv_ride_bike
back 
on 
my 
bike 
and 
slowly 
rode ScrEv_ride_bike
to 
work 
careful 
of 
anymore 
rocks 
. 
i 
got UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
work 
on 
time 
. 
this 
is UnrelEv_bicycle
why 
i 
always 
carry RelNScrEv_bicycle
around 
my 
repair 
kit 
. 
<end_of_story>_bicycle 
today 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
take ScrEv_ride_bike
a 
ride 
on 
my 
bicycle 
but 
could UnrelEv_bicycle
n't 
because 
it 
had+a+flat+tire Evoking_bicycle
. 
so 
i 
loaded RelNScrEv_bicycle
my 
bicycle 
up 
into 
my 
car 
and 
took RelNScrEv_bicycle
it 
to 
the 
bike 
shop 
to 
be 
repaired Evoking_bicycle
. 
the 
man 
that 
worked RelNScrEv_bicycle
at 
the 
shop 
put ScrEv_lay_bike_down
my 
bicycle 
upside 
down 
on 
a 
rack 
that 
held RelNScrEv_bicycle
it 
in 
place 
. 
he 
removed ScrEv_take_tire_off
the 
tire 
from 
the 
rim 
. 
the 
rim 
is UnrelEv_bicycle
the 
silver 
part 
that 
makes UnrelEv_bicycle
the 
tire 
go UnrelEv_bicycle
around 
. 
he 
then 
removed ScrEv_remove_tire
a 
rubber 
tube 
from 
inside 
the 
tire 
and 
replaced ScrEv_put_new_tire
it 
with 
a 
new 
tube 
. 
next 
the 
man 
put ScrEv_put_new_tire
the 
tire 
back 
onto 
my 
bike 
. 
he 
then 
took RelNScrEv_bicycle
my 
bike 
down 
off 
of 
the 
rack 
and 
added ScrEv_refill_tire_air
air 
to 
the 
tire 
to 
pump ScrEv_refill_tire_air
it 
up 
. 
he 
had UnrelEv_bicycle
me 
sit RelNScrEv_bicycle
on 
the 
bike 
to 
make+sure ScrEv_check_new_tire
the 
correct 
amount 
of 
air 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
in 
the 
tire 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
perfect 
and 
i 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
ready 
to 
ride ScrEv_ride_bike
! 
<end_of_story>_bicycle 
the 
other 
day 
my 
dad 
was 
riding ScrEv_ride_bike
his 
bike 
and 
started UnrelEv_bicycle
having ScrEv_notice_problem
trouble 
steering RelNScrEv_bicycle
. 
he 
rode ScrEv_ride_bike
the 
bike 
back 
home 
and 
then 
took RelNScrEv_bicycle
it 
into 
the 
back 
yard 
to 
have ScrEv_examine_tire
a 
look 
at 
it 
. 
he 
noticed ScrEv_notice_problem
that 
the 
front 
tire 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
flat 
and 
was 
n't 
keeping RelNScrEv_bicycle
air 
in 
it 
. 
he 
took ScrEv_take_tire_off
it 
off 
the 
bike 
. 
first 
he 
pumped ScrEv_refill_tire_air
it 
up 
and 
tried UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
see ScrEv_examine_tire
if 
the 
tire 
would 
hold RelNScrEv_bicycle
air 
. 
it 
would UnrelEv_bicycle
not 
. 
then 
he 
rubbed RelNScrEv_bicycle
liquid 
dish 
detergent 
on 
the 
tire 
and 
pumped ScrEv_refill_tire_air
it 
up 
and 
looked+for ScrEv_examine_tire
where 
it 
bubbled RelNScrEv_bicycle
to 
see ScrEv_examine_tire
where 
the 
hole 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
. 
once 
he 
found ScrEv_examine_tire
the 
hole 
, 
he 
decided UnrelEv_bicycle
if 
it 
needed RelNScrEv_bicycle
a 
patch 
or 
a 
plug 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
a 
small 
round 
hole 
so 
he 
decided UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
put ScrEv_put_patch/seal
a 
plug 
in 
it 
. 
he 
got ScrEv_get_tools
the 
packages 
of 
plugs 
and 
found RelNScrEv_bicycle
one 
that 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
the 
right 
size 
. 
he 
followed RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
instructs 
on 
the 
package 
to 
insert ScrEv_put_patch/seal
the 
plug 
into 
the 
hole 
and 
secure ScrEv_put_patch/seal
it 
. 
he 
pumped ScrEv_refill_tire_air
the 
tire 
back 
up 
and 
it 
held RelNScrEv_bicycle
air 
. 
he 
put ScrEv_put_new_tire
the 
tire 
back 
on 
the 
bike 
. 
<end_of_story>_bicycle 
today 
i 
hopped RelNScrEv_bicycle
on 
my 
bike 
to 
take ScrEv_ride_bike
a 
ride 
to 
the 
supermarket 
. 
when 
i 
sat+down RelNScrEv_bicycle
, 
i 
noticed ScrEv_notice_problem
my 
tire 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
flat 
. 
i 
looked ScrEv_notice_problem
down 
, 
and 
sure 
enough 
there 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
no 
air 
in 
the 
tire 
. 
i 
went UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
go UnrelEv_bicycle
get ScrEv_get_tools
my 
air 
pump 
and 
fill+up ScrEv_refill_tire_air
the 
tire 
. 
i 
unscrewed ScrEv_pull_air_pin
the 
cover 
of 
the 
nozzle 
and 
then 
attached RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
bicycle 
pump 
to 
it 
. 
i 
then 
filled ScrEv_refill_tire_air
the 
bicycle 
tire 
with 
air 
. 
after 
that 
, 
i 
released RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
bicycle 
pump 
and 
screwed RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
cover 
back 
on 
. 
then 
i 
rode ScrEv_ride_bike
my 
bicycle 
a 
little 
bit 
to 
see ScrEv_examine_tire
if 
the 
tire 
would 
remain RelNScrEv_bicycle
inflated ScrEv_refill_tire_air
. 
after 
a 
couple 
of 
loops 
around 
the 
street 
, 
i 
noticed ScrEv_notice_problem
the 
tire 
was 
beginning UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
flatten RelNScrEv_bicycle
again 
, 
so 
i 
decided UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
replace+the+bicycle+'s+inner+tube Evoking_bicycle
. 
i 
went UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
get ScrEv_get_tools
my 
spare 
inner 
tube 
as 
well 
as 
a 
screwdriver 
and 
wrench 
. 
i 
unbolted ScrEv_loose_nut
the 
wheel 
from 
the 
bicycle 
with 
the 
wrench 
. 
then 
i 
used RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
screw 
driver 
to 
take ScrEv_take_tire_off
the 
tire 
and 
old 
inner 
tube 
out 
. 
i 
brought+out ScrEv_get_tire
the 
new 
inner 
tube 
and 
placed ScrEv_put_new_tire
it 
inside 
the 
tire 
, 
then 
put ScrEv_put_new_tire
both 
back 
on 
the 
wheel 
and 
put ScrEv_put_new_tire
the 
wheel 
on 
the 
bike 
. 
i 
took+out ScrEv_get_tools
my 
air 
pump 
and 
filled ScrEv_refill_tire_air
the 
tire 
with 
air 
until 
it 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
firm 
. 
when 
i 
rode ScrEv_ride_bike
around 
this 
time 
the 
tire 
remained RelNScrEv_bicycle
firm 
, 
so 
i 
put RelNScrEv_bicycle
my 
things 
away 
and 
rode ScrEv_ride_bike
to 
the 
supermarket 
. 
<end_of_story>_bicycle 
my 
husband 
was 
riding ScrEv_ride_bike
down 
a 
steep 
hill 
a 
few 
miles 
from 
home 
when 
he 
got+a+blow+out Evoking_bicycle
. 
he 
called RelNScrEv_bicycle
me 
to 
come RelNScrEv_bicycle
and 
get RelNScrEv_bicycle
him 
. 
luckily 
he 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
n't 
hurt 
. 
he 
had ScrEv_get_tools
the 
bicycle 
repair 
kit 
on 
him 
. 
we 
took ScrEv_take_tire_off
the 
tire 
off 
with 
some 
tools 
. 
we 
took ScrEv_remove_tire
the 
inner 
tube 
out 
. 
he 
checked ScrEv_examine_tire
the 
inner 
tube 
for 
holes 
by 
putting ScrEv_refill_tire_air
air 
in 
it 
. 
he 
found ScrEv_examine_tire
the 
hole 
and 
marked RelNScrEv_bicycle
it 
. 
that 
is UnrelEv_bicycle
the 
place 
where 
he 
put ScrEv_put_patch/seal
the 
patch 
and 
glued ScrEv_put_patch/seal
it 
. 
my 
husband 
put ScrEv_put_new_tire
the 
tube 
back 
in 
the 
bicycle 
. 
the 
frame 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
a 
little 
bent 
but 
the 
bike 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
okay 
. 
i 
followed UnrelEv_bicycle
him 
for 
a 
little 
while 
. 
he 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
almost 
to 
the 
park 
so 
i 
met UnrelEv_bicycle
him 
there 
. 
after 
a 
while 
we 
put UnrelEv_bicycle
the 
bike 
in 
the 
back 
of 
the 
truck 
and 
drove UnrelEv_bicycle
home 
. 
<end_of_story>_bicycle 
i 
got RelNScrEv_bicycle
my 
yeti 
523 
enduro 
bike 
out 
and 
had 
made UnrelEv_bicycle
some 
minor 
adjustments 
to 
the 
tuning 
. 
one 
other 
adjustment 
i 
made+was UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
put UnrelEv_bicycle
some 
road 
tires 
on 
it 
so 
i 
could 
ride ScrEv_ride_bike
capital 
circle 
road 
of 
tallahassee 
south 
to 
the 
major 
bike 
trail 
. 
as 
i 
made ScrEv_ride_bike
my 
way 
through 
traffic 
in 
the 
bike 
lane 
the 
wind 
blew UnrelEv_bicycle
on 
my 
face 
and 
the 
sun 
warmed UnrelEv_bicycle
my 
skin 
. 
i 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
in 
a 
great 
mood 
. 
then 
all 
of 
a 
sudden 
the 
mood 
was 
dampened UnrelEv_bicycle
and 
corrupted UnrelEv_bicycle
by 
that 
horrible 
noise 
of 
leaking ScrEv_notice_problem
air 
. 
i 
had 
hit RelNScrEv_bicycle
some 
road 
debree 
that 
caused+a+flat+tire Evoking_bicycle
. 
after 
cursing RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
event 
and 
going RelNScrEv_bicycle
through 
a 
small 
tantrum 
i 
consulted ScrEv_get_tools
the 
tools 
of 
my 
backpack 
which 
i 
always 
brought ScrEv_get_tools
with 
me 
. 
i 
took ScrEv_take_tire_off
the 
tire 
off 
, 
removed ScrEv_remove_tire
the 
tube 
, 
isolated ScrEv_examine_tire
the 
puncture 
, 
and 
then 
applied ScrEv_put_patch/seal
the 
patch 
. 
i 
reassembled ScrEv_put_new_tire
the 
tube 
and 
tire 
, 
pumped ScrEv_refill_tire_air
it 
up 
with 
my 
small 
hand 
pump 
, 
and 
made ScrEv_ride_bike
my 
way 
back 
home 
. 
<end_of_story>_bicycle 
i 
went UnrelEv_bicycle
out 
to 
my 
garage 
to 
get RelNScrEv_bicycle
my 
bike 
to 
go ScrEv_ride_bike
on 
a 
ride 
. 
when 
i 
saw RelNScrEv_bicycle
my 
bike 
i 
realized ScrEv_notice_problem
that 
one 
of 
the 
tires 
were UnrelEv_bicycle
flat 
. 
i 
needed 
to 
buy ScrEv_get_tire
a 
new 
tube 
in 
order 
to 
fix+the+flat Evoking_bicycle
. 
i 
drove RelNScrEv_bicycle
to 
the 
local 
bike 
shop 
and 
purchased ScrEv_get_tire
a 
tube 
that 
would 
fit RelNScrEv_bicycle
my 
bike 
's 
tire 
and 
then 
i 
drove RelNScrEv_bicycle
back 
home 
. 
i 
took ScrEv_get_tire
the 
tube 
out 
of 
the 
packaging 
and 
read RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
instructions 
on 
how 
to 
put ScrEv_put_new_tire
it 
on 
the 
bike 
. 
i 
removed ScrEv_take_tire_off
the 
tire 
from 
the 
bike 
and 
took ScrEv_remove_tire
out 
the 
old 
tube 
that 
was 
punctured RelNScrEv_bicycle
. 
i 
then 
inserted ScrEv_put_new_tire
the 
new 
tube 
onto 
the 
tire 
. 
i 
put ScrEv_put_new_tire
the 
tire 
back 
on 
the 
bike 
and 
pumped+up ScrEv_refill_tire_air
the 
tube 
with 
air 
until 
it 
was 
filled ScrEv_refill_tire_air
to 
the 
desired UnrelEv_bicycle
fill 
weight 
. 
i 
got RelNScrEv_bicycle
on 
the 
bike 
to 
test ScrEv_check_new_tire
it 
and 
it 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
in 
great 
shape 
. 
then 
i 
took+off ScrEv_ride_bike
on 
my 
bike 
ride 
. 
<end_of_story>_bicycle 
yesterday 
, 
my 
bike 
tire 
popped RelNScrEv_bicycle
while 
i 
was 
riding ScrEv_ride_bike
it 
. 
i 
had 
to 
walk ScrEv_get_off
523 
min 
home 
to 
get+it+fixed Evoking_bicycle
. 
i 
had 
tried UnrelEv_bicycle
riding ScrEv_ride_bike
it 
with 
a 
flat 
tire 
, 
but 
the 
bike 
dragged RelNScrEv_bicycle
on 
the 
cement 
and 
i 
did 
n't 
have UnrelEv_bicycle
the 
man 
power 
to 
turn RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
wheels 
. 
when 
, 
i 
got RelNScrEv_bicycle
home 
i 
asked RelNScrEv_bicycle
my 
father 
for 
help 
. 
we 
inflated ScrEv_refill_tire_air
the 
tire 
a 
little 
with 
a 
mechanical 
pump 
. 
you 
grab ScrEv_refill_tire_air
the 
pump 
with 
two 
hands 
, 
pull ScrEv_refill_tire_air
the 
lever 
up 
and 
then 
push+down ScrEv_refill_tire_air
with 
your 
whole 
body 
weight 
. 
we 
put RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
tire 
underwater 
to 
find ScrEv_examine_tire
where 
bubbles 
were 
coming+out RelNScrEv_bicycle
to 
find ScrEv_examine_tire
the 
hole 
. 
after 
we 
found ScrEv_examine_tire
the 
hole 
, 
we 
dried RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
tire 
and 
sprayed ScrEv_put_patch/seal
a 
rubber 
sealant 
to 
the 
tire 
to 
seal ScrEv_put_patch/seal
the 
hole 
. 
afterwards 
, 
we 
inflated ScrEv_refill_tire_air
the 
tire 
. 
then 
, 
i 
got ScrEv_ride_bike
on 
it 
to 
see ScrEv_check_new_tire
if 
it 
worked RelNScrEv_bicycle
. 
after 
a 
day 
or 
so 
, 
i 
rode ScrEv_ride_bike
it 
again 
to 
make+sure ScrEv_check_new_tire
the 
tire 
was 
n't 
deflating RelNScrEv_bicycle
. 
<end_of_story>_bicycle 
when 
i 
was 
riding ScrEv_ride_bike
my 
bike 
last 
week 
i 
must 
have 
ran RelNScrEv_bicycle
over 
something 
sharp 
, 
because 
when 
i 
got RelNScrEv_bicycle
home 
i 
noticed ScrEv_notice_problem
that 
the 
front 
tire 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
flat 
. 
this 
was 
annoying UnrelEv_bicycle
especially 
since 
i 
did 
n't 
have UnrelEv_bicycle
the 
equipment 
to 
fix+it Evoking_bicycle
. 
so 
later 
that 
day 
i 
drove RelNScrEv_bicycle
over 
to 
the 
local 
sports 
store 
and 
bought ScrEv_get_tire
a 
new 
tire 
inner 
tube 
and 
an 
air 
pump 
. 
when 
i 
got RelNScrEv_bicycle
home 
i 
took+out ScrEv_remove_tire
the 
old 
punctured RelNScrEv_bicycle
inner 
tube 
from 
the 
tire 
and 
replaced ScrEv_put_new_tire
it 
with 
the 
new 
once 
. 
i 
then 
unscrewed ScrEv_pull_air_pin
the 
air 
cap 
on 
the 
tire 
and 
attached ScrEv_refill_tire_air
the 
air 
pump 
. 
i 
began UnrelEv_bicycle
pumping ScrEv_refill_tire_air
air 
into 
the 
tire 
, 
it 
took UnrelEv_bicycle
about 
523 
pumps 
before 
it 
was 
fully 
filled+up ScrEv_refill_tire_air
with 
air 
. 
i 
then 
got ScrEv_ride_bike
on 
the 
bike 
and 
tested ScrEv_check_new_tire
it 
to 
see ScrEv_check_new_tire
how 
it 
would 
hold+up RelNScrEv_bicycle
. 
it 
felt UnrelEv_bicycle
good 
as 
new 
. 
i 
rode ScrEv_ride_bike
around 
happy 
that 
it 
was 
fixed Evoking_bicycle
, 
and 
also 
happy 
that 
i 
now 
had ScrEv_get_tools
the 
equipment 
to 
fix+it Evoking_bicycle
again 
if 
it 
went RelNScrEv_bicycle
flat 
in 
the 
future 
. 
<end_of_story>_bicycle 
yesterday 
, 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
ride ScrEv_ride_bike
my 
bike 
because 
the 
weather 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
so 
nice 
. 
i 
got RelNScrEv_bicycle
my 
bike 
out 
of 
the 
storage 
closet 
and 
noticed ScrEv_notice_problem
it 
had RelNScrEv_bicycle
a 
flat 
tire 
. 
since 
i 
do 
not 
have RelNScrEv_bicycle
a 
spare 
tire 
, 
i 
had 
to 
fix+it Evoking_bicycle
if 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
ride ScrEv_ride_bike
. 
i 
found ScrEv_get_tools
my 
bike 
pump 
and 
patch 
kit 
. 
i 
pumped ScrEv_refill_tire_air
the 
tire 
and 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
able 
to 
locate ScrEv_examine_tire
the 
air 
leak 
. 
i 
took+out ScrEv_get_tools
the 
patch 
and 
applied ScrEv_put_patch/seal
it 
to 
the 
part 
of 
the 
tire 
that 
had RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
little 
leak 
. 
i 
then 
pumped ScrEv_refill_tire_air
the 
tire 
again 
. 
i 
had 
to 
be UnrelEv_bicycle
careful 
not 
to 
overfill ScrEv_refill_tire_air
the 
tire 
so 
the 
patch 
would 
n't 
pop+off RelNScrEv_bicycle
. 
once 
i 
was+sure UnrelEv_bicycle
the 
patch 
would 
n't 
come+off RelNScrEv_bicycle
, 
i 
made+sure UnrelEv_bicycle
that 
i 
pumped ScrEv_refill_tire_air
the 
air 
into 
the 
tire 
sufficiently 
. 
i 
tested ScrEv_check_new_tire
the 
tire 
by 
sitting RelNScrEv_bicycle
on 
the 
bike 
and 
riding ScrEv_ride_bike
around 
a 
little 
. 
the 
tire 
seemed ScrEv_check_new_tire
to 
hold RelNScrEv_bicycle
, 
so 
i 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
ready 
to 
go ScrEv_ride_bike
on 
my 
bike 
ride 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
such 
a 
nice 
day 
and 
i 
had UnrelEv_bicycle
a 
great 
day 
riding ScrEv_ride_bike
my 
bike 
. 
<end_of_story>_bicycle 
i 
was 
riding ScrEv_ride_bike
my 
bicycle 
down 
a 
beautiful 
country 
road 
on 
a 
sunny 
, 
summer 
day 
. 
when 
all 
of 
a 
sudden 
, 
i 
felt ScrEv_notice_problem
something 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
wrong 
. 
i 
stopped ScrEv_get_off
my 
bike 
, 
got+off ScrEv_get_off
and 
looked RelNScrEv_bicycle
down 
. 
my 
front 
tire 
had 
gone RelNScrEv_bicycle
flat 
. 
i 
must 
have 
ridden ScrEv_ride_bike
over 
something 
sharp 
to 
puncture RelNScrEv_bicycle
it 
. 
so 
i 
pulled+out ScrEv_get_tools
my 
gear 
bag 
that 
i 
had 
strapped RelNScrEv_bicycle
to 
my 
bike 
. 
i 
found ScrEv_get_tire
an 
extra 
rubber 
tire 
liner 
and 
the 
tools 
needed UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
repair+it Evoking_bicycle
. 
i 
took ScrEv_free_wheel
the 
wheel 
off 
my 
bike 
so 
it 
would 
be UnrelEv_bicycle
easier 
to 
work RelNScrEv_bicycle
on 
. 
i 
removed ScrEv_remove_tire
the 
punctured RelNScrEv_bicycle
rubber 
tire 
liner 
from 
the 
wheel 
. 
i 
replaced ScrEv_put_new_tire
it 
with 
the 
new 
one 
using RelNScrEv_bicycle
my 
tools 
. 
i 
then 
used RelNScrEv_bicycle
a 
special 
little 
cartridge 
i 
had 
brought ScrEv_get_tools
with 
me 
that 
was 
filled UnrelEv_bicycle
with 
pressurized UnrelEv_bicycle
carbon 
dioxide 
to 
pump ScrEv_refill_tire_air
my 
new 
tire 
up 
. 
once 
it 
was 
done UnrelEv_bicycle
, 
i 
placed ScrEv_put_new_tire
it 
back 
on 
my 
bike 
and 
continued+on ScrEv_ride_bike
with 
my 
ride 
. 
<end_of_story>_bicycle 
i 
was 
riding ScrEv_ride_bike
by 
bicycle 
along 
the 
river 
trail 
this 
morning 
when 
i 
noticed ScrEv_notice_problem
that 
something 
did 
n't 
seem UnrelEv_bicycle
right 
. 
my 
front 
tire 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
n't 
as 
firm 
as 
it 
usually 
is UnrelEv_bicycle
, 
and 
the 
situation 
was 
getting UnrelEv_bicycle
worse 
. 
i 
stopped RelNScrEv_bicycle
pedaling ScrEv_ride_bike
, 
got+off ScrEv_get_off
the 
bike 
, 
and 
put ScrEv_examine_tire
my 
ear 
to 
the 
tire 
. 
i 
could 
hear ScrEv_examine_tire
a 
faint 
hissing RelNScrEv_bicycle
sound 
. 
the 
tire 
was RelNScrEv_bicycle
flat 
. 
darn 
, 
i 
thought UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
myself 
. 
i 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
miles 
from 
home 
-- 
too 
far 
to 
walk RelNScrEv_bicycle
back 
, 
and 
nowhere 
near 
a 
repair 
shop 
. 
fortunately 
, 
i 
keep ScrEv_get_tools
a 
patch 
kit 
that 
i 
bought ScrEv_get_tools
at 
the 
local 
bike 
shop 
in 
my 
backpack 
. 
i 
took RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
backpack 
off 
, 
rummaged RelNScrEv_bicycle
around 
inside 
for 
the 
repair 
kit 
, 
and 
grabbed ScrEv_get_tools
it 
. 
it 
had 
been UnrelEv_bicycle
a 
year 
since 
i 
last 
used RelNScrEv_bicycle
it 
, 
but 
i 
got UnrelEv_bicycle
the 
hang 
of 
it 
. 
i 
found ScrEv_examine_tire
the 
exact 
spot 
of 
the 
hole 
in 
the 
tire 
, 
patched ScrEv_put_patch/seal
it 
, 
and 
then 
re-inflated ScrEv_refill_tire_air
the 
tire 
. 
my 
hands 
were UnrelEv_bicycle
dirty 
, 
but 
i 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
able 
to 
ride ScrEv_ride_bike
home 
without 
any 
further 
trouble 
. 
<end_of_story>_bicycle 
i 
was 
having ScrEv_ride_bike
a 
nice 
bicycle 
ride 
on 
a 
sunny 
day 
. 
something 
seemed ScrEv_notice_problem
off 
about 
my 
bike 
but 
it 
took UnrelEv_bicycle
me 
quite 
the 
while 
before 
i 
realized ScrEv_notice_problem
what 
had 
happened UnrelEv_bicycle
. 
at 
some 
point 
, 
one 
of 
my 
bike 
's 
tires 
went+flat Evoking_bicycle
. 
i 
got+off ScrEv_get_off
at 
a 
safe 
stopping 
point 
away 
from 
the 
highway 
and 
turned ScrEv_lay_bike_down
my 
bicycle 
upside 
down 
. 
sure 
enough 
, 
one 
of 
my 
tires 
was RelNScrEv_bicycle
flat 
, 
the 
back 
tire 
specifically 
. 
this 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
why 
i 
always 
carried ScrEv_get_tools
a 
small 
travel 
bag 
of 
tools 
. 
i 
set+down ScrEv_get_tools
the 
bag 
and 
began UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
work RelNScrEv_bicycle
. 
first 
i 
took+off ScrEv_take_tire_off
my 
tire 
. 
there 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
a 
quick 
release 
which 
made UnrelEv_bicycle
it 
very 
easy 
to 
take+off ScrEv_take_tire_off
. 
i 
just 
moved RelNScrEv_bicycle
a 
simple 
lever 
. 
next 
, 
i 
used RelNScrEv_bicycle
my 
tire 
lever 
to 
detach ScrEv_remove_tire
the 
tire 
from 
the 
rim 
. 
before 
putting ScrEv_put_new_tire
in 
a 
new 
tube 
from 
my 
bag 
, 
i 
filled ScrEv_refill_tire_air
it 
with 
just 
a 
little 
bit 
of 
air 
. 
once 
it 
was 
set RelNScrEv_bicycle
in 
place 
, 
i 
just 
put ScrEv_put_new_tire
the 
tire 
back 
on 
and 
continued ScrEv_ride_bike
my 
trip 
. 
<end_of_story>_bicycle 
yesterday 
while 
i 
was 
riding ScrEv_ride_bike
my 
bike 
i 
got+a+flat+tire Evoking_bicycle
. 
luckily 
i 
had ScrEv_get_tools
a 
tire 
repair 
kit 
in 
the 
garage 
. 
it 
's UnrelEv_bicycle
very 
easy 
to 
do UnrelEv_bicycle
. 
the 
first 
thing 
i 
did UnrelEv_bicycle
was 
use RelNScrEv_bicycle
a 
flathead 
screwdriver 
to 
pop ScrEv_take_tire_off
the 
tire 
off 
of 
the 
rim 
. 
the 
tire 
is UnrelEv_bicycle
hollow 
inside 
, 
with 
no 
tube 
. 
the 
patch 
kit 
contains RelNScrEv_bicycle
small 
rubber 
patches 
with 
glue 
, 
that 
you 
use RelNScrEv_bicycle
to 
seal+up ScrEv_put_patch/seal
any 
holes 
that 
might 
appear RelNScrEv_bicycle
. 
when 
i 
had ScrEv_take_tire_off
the 
tire 
off 
the 
rim 
i 
looked ScrEv_examine_tire
all 
around 
inside 
to 
find ScrEv_examine_tire
the 
hole 
. 
when 
i 
found ScrEv_examine_tire
it 
, 
i 
used RelNScrEv_bicycle
a 
special 
piece 
of 
sandpaper 
inside 
the 
repair 
kit 
to 
clean+off RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
area 
around 
the 
hole 
, 
so 
the 
glue 
would 
stick RelNScrEv_bicycle
nicely 
. 
i 
then 
applied RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
glue 
and 
put ScrEv_put_patch/seal
one 
of 
the 
small 
rubber 
patches 
onto 
it 
. 
the 
instructions 
said UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
let UnrelEv_bicycle
it 
dry RelNScrEv_bicycle
for 
a 
few 
hours 
, 
so 
i 
went UnrelEv_bicycle
inside 
and 
watched UnrelEv_bicycle
tv 
. 
after 
awhile 
i 
came UnrelEv_bicycle
back 
out 
and 
put ScrEv_put_new_tire
the 
tire 
back 
on 
the 
rim 
, 
then 
used RelNScrEv_bicycle
a 
pump 
to 
pump ScrEv_refill_tire_air
the 
tire 
full 
of 
air 
. 
sure 
enough 
, 
it 
fixed+the+hole Evoking_bicycle
! 
<end_of_story>_bicycle 
riding ScrEv_ride_bike
my 
bike 
through 
the 
park 
, 
i 
was 
enjoying UnrelEv_bicycle
the 
beautiful 
spring 
scenery 
. 
a 
family 
of 
squirrels 
caught UnrelEv_bicycle
my 
attention 
and 
i 
was 
looking UnrelEv_bicycle
at 
them 
when 
i 
hit RelNScrEv_bicycle
some 
broken UnrelEv_bicycle
glass 
. 
my 
bike 
's 
tire 
immediately 
deflated Evoking_bicycle
. 
i 
walked ScrEv_get_off
it 
back 
to 
my 
car 
, 
loaded+up RelNScrEv_bicycle
, 
and 
headed RelNScrEv_bicycle
for 
a 
local 
department 
store 
. 
sure 
enough 
, 
they 
had RelNScrEv_bicycle
bike 
tire 
repair 
kits 
in 
the 
sporting 
goods 
section 
. 
i 
bought ScrEv_get_tools
one 
, 
and 
then 
headed+on RelNScrEv_bicycle
home 
. 
once 
there 
i 
removed ScrEv_free_wheel
a 
wheel 
from 
the 
bike 
. 
from 
it 
i 
took+out ScrEv_remove_tire
the 
inner 
tube 
. 
i 
rubbed RelNScrEv_bicycle
some 
soapy 
water 
on 
it 
and 
quickly 
found ScrEv_examine_tire
the 
problem 
spot 
. 
from 
my 
new 
repair 
kit 
i 
found ScrEv_get_tools
a 
special 
patch 
. 
i 
applied RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
sealant 
and 
then 
stuck ScrEv_put_patch/seal
the 
patch 
on 
. 
i 
used RelNScrEv_bicycle
a 
hair 
dryer 
to 
heat RelNScrEv_bicycle
and 
set RelNScrEv_bicycle
it 
. 
next 
, 
i 
took+out ScrEv_get_tools
the 
air 
compressor 
and 
reinflated ScrEv_refill_tire_air
the 
inner 
tube 
. 
after 
reassembling ScrEv_put_new_tire
everything 
, 
i 
sat RelNScrEv_bicycle
on 
the 
bike 
and 
tested ScrEv_check_new_tire
it 
out 
. 
good 
as 
new 
! 
<end_of_story>_bicycle 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
go+for+a+bike+ride Evoking_bicycle
, 
so 
i 
went+out UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
the 
garage 
to 
get ScrEv_other_bicycle
my 
bike 
. 
i 
brought RelNScrEv_bicycle
it 
out 
to 
the 
driveway 
and 
got+on RelNScrEv_bicycle
. 
i 
noticed ScrEv_notice_problem
that 
something 
did 
n't 
feel UnrelEv_bicycle
right 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
too 
hard 
to 
pedal RelNScrEv_bicycle
. 
i 
looked+down UnrelEv_bicycle
and 
noticed ScrEv_notice_problem
that 
my 
front 
tire 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
flat 
. 
i 
went+back UnrelEv_bicycle
into 
the 
garage 
and 
brought+out ScrEv_get_tools
my 
bicycle 
pump 
. 
i 
removed ScrEv_other_bicycle
the 
cover 
from 
the 
air 
valve 
and 
attached ScrEv_other_bicycle
the 
pump 
to 
it 
. 
i 
pumped ScrEv_other_bicycle
up 
and 
down 
on 
the 
handle 
a 
few 
times 
and 
noticed ScrEv_notice_problem
that 
the 
air 
was 
not 
staying+in RelNScrEv_bicycle
. 
i 
went+back UnrelEv_bicycle
into 
the 
garage 
, 
again 
, 
and 
this 
time 
i 
brought+out ScrEv_get_tools
my 
bicycle 
repair 
kit 
. 
i 
found ScrEv_other_bicycle
the 
hole 
in 
my 
tire 
, 
put ScrEv_put_patch/seal
a 
patch 
on 
, 
and 
then 
filled ScrEv_refill_tire_air
the 
tire 
with 
air 
. 
the 
patch 
seemed UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
be 
nice 
and 
sturdy 
and 
i 
believed UnrelEv_bicycle
it 
was 
going 
to 
hold RelNScrEv_bicycle
. 
i 
put ScrEv_other_bicycle
the 
air 
pump 
and 
the 
bicycle 
tire 
patch 
kit 
back 
into 
the 
garage 
, 
put+on UnrelEv_bicycle
my 
helmet 
, 
and 
rode RelNScrEv_bicycle
my 
bicycle 
down 
the 
street 
. 
<end_of_story>_bicycle 
i 
was+riding+my+bike Evoking_bicycle
yesterday 
and 
somehow 
i 
must 
have 
run+over RelNScrEv_bicycle
something 
and 
punctured RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
front 
tire 
of 
my 
bike 
. 
i 
measured RelNScrEv_bicycle
my 
tire 
height 
and 
wrote+down RelNScrEv_bicycle
my 
model 
of 
my 
bike 
before 
i 
wen ScrEv_other_bicycle
to 
the 
bike 
shop 
to 
buy ScrEv_get_tire
a 
new 
inner 
tube 
. 
i 
go ScrEv_other_bicycle
to 
the 
bike 
shop 
and 
the 
man 
behind 
the 
counter 
asked RelNScrEv_bicycle
what 
i 
needed UnrelEv_bicycle
help 
with 
. 
i 
explained RelNScrEv_bicycle
i 
needed UnrelEv_bicycle
a 
new 
inner 
tube 
for 
my 
bike 
since 
i 
had 
gotten RelNScrEv_bicycle
a 
flat 
tire 
. 
i 
showed RelNScrEv_bicycle
him 
the 
model 
number 
and 
the 
tire 
height 
an 
d 
he 
quickly 
went UnrelEv_bicycle
a 
got RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
inner 
tube 
i 
needed UnrelEv_bicycle
. 
i 
payed RelNScrEv_bicycle
for 
my 
purchase 
, 
thank UnrelEv_bicycle
the 
man 
and 
went UnrelEv_bicycle
home 
to 
fix+my+bike Evoking_bicycle
. 
i 
took ScrEv_free_wheel
the 
front 
tire 
off 
and 
gently 
pried ScrEv_take_tire_off
the 
outer 
tire 
off 
. 
the 
inner 
tube 
is UnrelEv_bicycle
sort 
of 
pliable 
so 
i 
stretched ScrEv_take_tire_off
it 
over 
and 
off 
of 
the 
rim 
. 
i 
took UnrelEv_bicycle
the 
new 
inner 
tube 
and 
stretched ScrEv_put_new_tire
it 
on 
the 
metal 
rim 
, 
making+sure UnrelEv_bicycle
the 
stem 
when 
you 
inflate RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
tire 
was 
lined+up UnrelEv_bicycle
with 
the 
hole 
on 
the 
metal 
rim 
. 
i 
replaced ScrEv_remove_tire
the 
outer 
tire 
and 
re-inflated ScrEv_refill_tire_air
the 
tire 
with 
my 
bicycle 
pump 
. 
now 
i 
can 
ride ScrEv_ride_bike
my 
bike 
again 
! 
<end_of_story>_bicycle 
last 
week 
, 
i 
was 
riding ScrEv_ride_bike
my 
bicycle 
on 
a 
dirt 
path 
through 
the 
forest 
. 
the 
path 
had UnrelEv_bicycle
many 
rocks 
and 
branches 
on 
it 
and 
at 
some 
point 
during 
my 
ride 
, 
i 
hit RelNScrEv_bicycle
a 
rock 
and 
put RelNScrEv_bicycle
a 
hole 
in 
the 
tire 
. 
i 
was 
forced UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
walk RelNScrEv_bicycle
my 
bike 
back 
to 
my 
house 
and 
inspect ScrEv_examine_tire
the 
tires 
. 
it 
seemed UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
be UnrelEv_bicycle
a 
minor 
hole 
where 
the 
rock 
had 
pierced RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
tire 
that 
would 
require UnrelEv_bicycle
some 
minor 
patching RelNScrEv_bicycle
. 
i 
loaded ScrEv_other_bicycle
the 
bicycle 
into 
the 
back 
of 
the 
car 
and 
drove ScrEv_other_bicycle
it 
to 
our 
local 
bike 
shop 
where 
they 
applied ScrEv_put_patch/seal
some 
sort 
of 
fill 
to 
the 
hole 
and 
patched ScrEv_put_patch/seal
it 
up 
. 
once 
completed UnrelEv_bicycle
, 
my 
tires 
retained UnrelEv_bicycle
their 
air 
pressure 
and 
were UnrelEv_bicycle
good 
as 
new 
. 
i 
paid RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
man 
at 
the 
shop 
and 
took RelNScrEv_bicycle
my 
bike 
home 
. 
the 
next 
day 
, 
i 
took UnrelEv_bicycle
it 
back 
out 
for 
a 
ride 
and 
all 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
well 
! 
the 
bike 
shop 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
far 
better 
equipped RelNScrEv_bicycle
to 
fix+my+flat Evoking_bicycle
than 
i 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
. 
<end_of_story>_bicycle 
the 
flat 
tire 
it 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
a 
beautiful 
sunny 
day 
with 
only 
a 
slight 
breeze 
. 
it 
seemed UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
me 
like 
a 
perfect 
day 
for 
a 
bicycle 
ride 
. 
i 
thought UnrelEv_bicycle
i 
would 
ride ScrEv_ride_bike
on 
the 
bike 
trails 
to 
the 
park 
and 
enjoy UnrelEv_bicycle
my 
day 
. 
however 
, 
when 
i 
went+out UnrelEv_bicycle
into 
the 
garage 
, 
i 
saw ScrEv_notice_problem
that 
the 
back 
tire 
on 
my 
bicycle 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
flat 
. 
luckily 
, 
i 
had UnrelEv_bicycle
a 
spare 
tire 
on 
hand 
. 
the 
tire 
that 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
flat 
had 
been UnrelEv_bicycle
on 
my 
bicycle 
for 
a 
couple 
of 
years 
now 
, 
it 
needed 
replaced ScrEv_remove_tire
anyway 
. 
i 
remembered UnrelEv_bicycle
how 
my 
dad 
had 
taught UnrelEv_bicycle
me 
to 
replace ScrEv_remove_tire
the 
tire 
and 
got UnrelEv_bicycle
the 
job 
done UnrelEv_bicycle
. 
it 
did 
not 
take RelNScrEv_bicycle
as 
long 
as 
i 
thought UnrelEv_bicycle
it 
might UnrelEv_bicycle
. 
i 
kept RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
old 
tire 
to 
see UnrelEv_bicycle
if 
i 
could 
patch ScrEv_put_patch/seal
it 
up 
later 
and 
put ScrEv_refill_tire_air
air 
in 
it 
to 
have UnrelEv_bicycle
on 
hand 
as 
a 
spare 
when 
i 
needed UnrelEv_bicycle
one 
. 
after 
my 
new 
tire 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
on 
my 
bike 
, 
i 
went ScrEv_ride_bike
for 
the 
ride 
to 
the 
park 
that 
i 
planned UnrelEv_bicycle
and 
had UnrelEv_bicycle
a 
great 
time 
. 
<end_of_story>_bicycle 
i 
was 
riding ScrEv_ride_bike
my 
new 
bicycle 
when 
i 
stumbled UnrelEv_bicycle
over 
a 
rock 
or 
something 
. 
the 
tire 
seemed UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
explode RelNScrEv_bicycle
upon 
impact 
. 
i 
struggled UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
stay UnrelEv_bicycle
atop 
the 
bicycle 
but 
was 
fortunately 
able 
to 
keep UnrelEv_bicycle
my 
balance 
. 
i 
knew UnrelEv_bicycle
that 
i 
had 
to 
fix+my+tire Evoking_bicycle
in 
order 
to 
use RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
bike 
. 
i 
knew UnrelEv_bicycle
the 
local 
gas 
station 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
only 
a 
few 
blocks 
away 
so 
i 
decided UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
walk ScrEv_other_bicycle
my 
bike 
there 
. 
the 
first 
thing 
i 
did UnrelEv_bicycle
was 
get ScrEv_get_tools
something 
to 
tape+up ScrEv_put_patch/seal
the 
hole 
. 
the 
manager 
gave RelNScrEv_bicycle
me 
some 
sort 
of 
sticky 
resin 
in 
order 
to 
patch ScrEv_put_patch/seal
things 
up 
. 
i 
went UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
the 
air 
pump 
to 
put ScrEv_refill_tire_air
some 
air 
into 
the 
tire 
and 
once 
it 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
full 
i 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
ready 
to 
patch ScrEv_put_patch/seal
it 
up 
. 
i 
used RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
resin 
to 
cover ScrEv_put_patch/seal
the 
hole 
and 
the 
tire 
seemed UnrelEv_bicycle
as 
good 
as 
new 
. 
i 
rode ScrEv_ride_bike
the 
bike 
home 
and 
made+sure UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
avoid+rolling UnrelEv_bicycle
over 
anymore 
rocks 
. 
<end_of_story>_bicycle 
i 
began UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
repair+my+flat+bicycle+tire Evoking_bicycle
by 
removing ScrEv_take_tire_off
the 
wheel 
from 
the 
bike 
. 
this 
was 
done UnrelEv_bicycle
by 
disconnecting RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
brake 
cable 
so 
the 
wheel 
would 
be 
able 
to 
be 
removed RelNScrEv_bicycle
from 
the 
frame 
. 
i 
then 
loosened ScrEv_loose_nut
the 
bolts 
holding UnrelEv_bicycle
it 
on 
and 
slid ScrEv_free_wheel
the 
axle 
off 
the 
frame 
, 
making+sure UnrelEv_bicycle
that 
the 
chain 
did 
not 
get+caught RelNScrEv_bicycle
or 
bind+up RelNScrEv_bicycle
while 
doing UnrelEv_bicycle
so 
. 
after 
the 
wheel 
was 
removed ScrEv_remove_tire
, 
i 
made+sure UnrelEv_bicycle
that 
all 
possible 
air 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
out 
of 
the 
tube 
so 
that 
it 
would 
be UnrelEv_bicycle
easier 
to 
remove ScrEv_remove_tire
. 
i 
next 
took ScrEv_get_tools
two 
flat 
head 
screwdrivers 
and 
began UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
remove ScrEv_remove_tire
the 
tire 
from 
the 
bicycle 
. 
after 
the 
tire 
was 
finally 
removed ScrEv_remove_tire
, 
i 
pulled ScrEv_other_bicycle
the 
tube 
off 
the 
rim 
as 
well 
. 
next 
, 
i 
placed ScrEv_other_bicycle
a 
new 
tube 
in 
place 
making+sure UnrelEv_bicycle
that 
the 
valve 
stem 
was 
placed RelNScrEv_bicycle
through 
the 
rim 
appropriately 
. 
after 
doing UnrelEv_bicycle
this 
, 
i 
began UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
fit ScrEv_put_new_tire
the 
tire 
to 
the 
rim 
, 
making+sure UnrelEv_bicycle
the 
tube 
was 
placed RelNScrEv_bicycle
inside 
the 
tire 
and 
not 
pinched RelNScrEv_bicycle
at 
all 
. 
once 
the 
tire 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
on 
the 
rim 
, 
i 
inflated ScrEv_refill_tire_air
the 
tube 
, 
making+sure UnrelEv_bicycle
that 
the 
tire 
seated RelNScrEv_bicycle
onto 
the 
rim 
properly 
and 
that 
everything 
held RelNScrEv_bicycle
air 
. 
finally 
, 
i 
reinstalled ScrEv_put_new_tire
the 
wheel 
onto 
the 
bike 
, 
and 
reconnected RelNScrEv_bicycle
everything 
appropriately 
. 
<end_of_story>_bicycle 
i 
began UnrelEv_bicycle
by 
finding ScrEv_notice_problem
the 
culprit 
of 
my 
flat 
tire 
, 
it 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
a 
nail 
on 
the 
side 
of 
the 
road 
. 
unfortunately 
i 
did 
not 
have UnrelEv_bicycle
a 
spare 
tire 
so 
i 
had 
to 
carry ScrEv_other_bicycle
my 
bike 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
way 
home 
. 
after 
the 
gruesome 
trek 
back 
to 
my 
house 
i 
flipped ScrEv_lay_bike_down
the 
bicycle 
upside 
down 
and 
began+my+repair Evoking_bicycle
. 
first 
i 
took+off ScrEv_take_tire_off
the 
outer 
tire 
to 
replace RelNScrEv_bicycle
my 
tube 
with 
a 
better 
more 
expensive 
tube 
that 
has UnrelEv_bicycle
the 
ability 
to 
fix RelNScrEv_bicycle
a 
puncture 
. 
i 
do 
not 
want UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
experience UnrelEv_bicycle
carrying RelNScrEv_bicycle
my 
bike 
a 
mile 
ever 
again 
. 
after 
putting ScrEv_other_bicycle
the 
new 
tube 
on 
i 
screw ScrEv_put_new_tire
back 
on 
the 
tire 
and 
put 
the 
outer 
tire 
over 
the 
tube 
. 
i 
then 
fill ScrEv_refill_tire_air
the 
psi 
to 
523 
in 
my 
tire 
and 
listen ScrEv_check_new_tire
for 
any 
leaking RelNScrEv_bicycle
air 
. 
then 
i 
spin ScrEv_other_bicycle
the 
tire 
to 
make UnrelEv_bicycle
all 
the 
slime 
inside 
become 
evenly 
distributed UnrelEv_bicycle
throughout 
. 
this 
will 
prevent RelNScrEv_bicycle
leaks 
in 
the 
future 
and 
even 
with 
a 
slight 
leak 
i 
will 
still 
be 
able 
to 
ride ScrEv_ride_bike
back 
home 
and 
fix RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
tire 
quickly 
yet 
again 
. 
<end_of_story>_bicycle 
i 
was 
riding ScrEv_ride_bike
my 
bike 
home 
from 
school 
one 
day 
when 
i 
went+through UnrelEv_bicycle
a 
thorny 
patch 
of 
ground 
while 
going UnrelEv_bicycle
through 
the 
park 
. 
the 
tire 
then 
went RelNScrEv_bicycle
flat 
after 
a 
few 
more 
minutes 
of 
riding ScrEv_ride_bike
and 
i 
was 
stuck UnrelEv_bicycle
a 
couple 
of 
miles 
from 
home 
. 
i 
called UnrelEv_bicycle
my 
dad 
and 
told UnrelEv_bicycle
him 
what 
happened UnrelEv_bicycle
and 
where 
i 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
. 
after 
a 
few 
minutes 
, 
he 
showed UnrelEv_bicycle
up 
with 
new 
inner 
tubes 
and 
a 
few 
tools 
to 
help UnrelEv_bicycle
me 
fix+my+bike+tires Evoking_bicycle
. 
we 
started UnrelEv_bicycle
by 
removing ScrEv_take_tire_off
the 
outer 
rubber 
of 
the 
tires 
and 
getting ScrEv_take_tire_off
the 
damaged 
inner 
tubes 
out 
. 
then 
we 
replaced ScrEv_remove_tire
them 
with 
new 
ones 
. 
after 
reinstalling ScrEv_put_new_tire
the 
tubes 
and 
putting ScrEv_put_new_tire
them 
back 
onto 
the 
bicycle 
, 
we 
had 
to 
inflate ScrEv_refill_tire_air
the 
tires 
which 
took RelNScrEv_bicycle
a 
few 
minutes 
with 
a 
foot 
pump 
. 
afterwards 
, 
he 
drove UnrelEv_bicycle
home 
and 
i 
followed UnrelEv_bicycle
on 
my 
repaired RelNScrEv_bicycle
bike 
. 
i 
promised UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
avoid UnrelEv_bicycle
patches 
of 
thorns 
after 
that 
since 
it 
cost UnrelEv_bicycle
me 
523 
weeks 
of 
allowance 
to 
buy ScrEv_get_tire
the 
inner 
tubes 
. 
<end_of_story>_bicycle 
it 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
a 
sunny 
afternoon 
so 
my 
friend 
and 
i 
went 
decided UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
go ScrEv_ride_bike
for 
a 
ride 
on 
our 
bicycles 
in 
the 
woods 
. 
i 
did 
n't 
check RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
air 
pressure 
beforehand 
and 
thought UnrelEv_bicycle
it 
would 
be UnrelEv_bicycle
okay 
. 
as 
we 
were 
riding ScrEv_ride_bike
through 
the 
trails 
in 
the 
woods 
the 
terrain 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
more 
rough 
than 
i 
had 
expected UnrelEv_bicycle
and 
the 
the 
tire 
went ScrEv_other_bicycle
flat 
. 
i 
got+off ScrEv_get_off
my 
bicycle 
and 
knelt+down UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
check ScrEv_notice_problem
the 
condition 
of 
the 
tire 
to 
see ScrEv_notice_problem
if 
there 
were UnrelEv_bicycle
any 
punctures 
. 
there 
were UnrelEv_bicycle
n't 
any 
and 
it 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
just 
out 
of 
air 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
a 
good 
thing 
my 
friend 
packed ScrEv_get_tools
an 
air 
pump 
. 
i 
stuck ScrEv_refill_tire_air
the 
needle 
from 
the 
air 
pump 
into 
the 
tire 
and 
started UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
pump ScrEv_refill_tire_air
air 
. 
the 
bicycle 
tire 
started UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
inflate RelNScrEv_bicycle
and 
it 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
good 
as 
new 
. 
i 
packed UnrelEv_bicycle
the 
air 
pump 
and 
handed UnrelEv_bicycle
it 
back 
to 
my 
friend 
and 
continued ScrEv_ride_bike
our 
bicycle 
adventure 
in 
the 
woods 
. 
<end_of_story>_bicycle 
last 
week 
when 
i 
went 
biking ScrEv_ride_bike
on 
a 
trail 
with 
a 
friend 
, 
she 
rode+over ScrEv_ride_bike
a 
nail 
and 
one 
of 
her 
bike 
tires 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
punctured RelNScrEv_bicycle
. 
we 
immediately 
stopped ScrEv_get_off
riding ScrEv_ride_bike
so 
that 
we 
could 
fix+the+problem Evoking_bicycle
, 
and 
we 
were UnrelEv_bicycle
lucky 
that 
it 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
n't 
too 
bad 
of 
an 
issue 
. 
to 
fix Evoking_bicycle
it 
, 
we 
had 
to 
return ScrEv_other_bicycle
home 
and 
take RelNScrEv_bicycle
care 
of 
it 
with 
the 
tools 
we 
had RelNScrEv_bicycle
there 
. 
we 
turned ScrEv_lay_bike_down
the 
bike 
over 
so 
it 
was 
resting RelNScrEv_bicycle
on 
the 
handlebars 
and 
the 
seat 
so 
that 
we 
would 
have UnrelEv_bicycle
access 
to 
the 
wheel 
very 
easily 
. 
upon 
spinning ScrEv_other_bicycle
the 
wheel 
, 
we 
found RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
nail 
she 
had 
run+over RelNScrEv_bicycle
and 
removed ScrEv_other_bicycle
it 
. 
we 
had 
to 
release ScrEv_other_bicycle
all 
the 
air 
from 
the 
tube 
to 
begin UnrelEv_bicycle
with 
, 
then 
take ScrEv_take_tire_off
the 
tire 
off 
of 
the 
rim 
using RelNScrEv_bicycle
tools 
called UnrelEv_bicycle
a 
tire 
levers 
. 
after 
we 
had UnrelEv_bicycle
that 
off 
, 
we 
had 
to 
remove ScrEv_take_tire_off
the 
tube 
from 
the 
tire 
and 
inflate ScrEv_refill_tire_air
it 
with 
enough 
air 
to 
find RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
hole 
. 
we 
knew UnrelEv_bicycle
about 
where 
it 
would 
be UnrelEv_bicycle
. 
using RelNScrEv_bicycle
a 
piece 
of 
my 
brother 
's 
chalk 
, 
we 
marked ScrEv_other_bicycle
where 
the 
hole 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
so 
we 
would 
n't 
lose UnrelEv_bicycle
the 
spot 
, 
and 
then 
we 
took ScrEv_other_bicycle
the 
air 
out 
of 
the 
tube 
again 
. 
using RelNScrEv_bicycle
a 
patch 
kit 
designed UnrelEv_bicycle
for 
this 
kind 
of 
issue 
, 
we 
patched+up ScrEv_put_patch/seal
the 
hole 
and 
put ScrEv_other_bicycle
the 
tube 
back 
into 
the 
tire 
. 
we 
put ScrEv_put_new_tire
the 
tire 
back 
on 
the 
wheel 
and 
re-inflated ScrEv_refill_tire_air
it 
. 
the 
patch 
worked UnrelEv_bicycle
perfectly 
and 
we 
were 
able 
to 
go+out UnrelEv_bicycle
biking ScrEv_ride_bike
again 
the 
next 
day 
! 
<end_of_story>_bicycle 
after 
getting RelNScrEv_bicycle
a 
flat 
tire 
on 
my 
bicycle 
, 
i 
took ScrEv_other_bicycle
my 
bike 
into 
the 
garage 
and 
placed ScrEv_other_bicycle
it 
on 
my 
bike+repair Evoking_bicycle
stand 
. 
i 
got ScrEv_get_tools
all 
the 
necessary 
tools 
and 
items 
ready 
for 
repair Evoking_bicycle
: 
my 
air 
compressor 
-lrb- 
smaller 
air 
compressor 
which 
serves RelNScrEv_bicycle
as 
my 
air 
pump 
-rrb- 
, 
my 
alan 
key 
-lrb- 
hex 
key 
-rrb- 
, 
my 
spare 
tire 
, 
and 
tube 
repair 
just 
in 
case 
my 
tire 
could 
be 
saved UnrelEv_bicycle
by 
patching RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
inner 
tube 
. 
after 
placing ScrEv_other_bicycle
my 
bike 
on 
the 
stand 
, 
i 
was 
able 
to 
remove ScrEv_take_tire_off
the 
back 
tire 
off 
of 
the 
rim 
and 
i 
noticed ScrEv_notice_problem
how 
the 
inner 
tube 
of 
the 
tire 
could 
not 
be 
saved UnrelEv_bicycle
. 
as 
a 
result 
, 
i 
tossed ScrEv_remove_tire
the 
damaged 
tire 
to 
the 
side 
and 
picked+up ScrEv_get_tire
the 
spare 
tire 
to 
place ScrEv_put_new_tire
it 
on 
empty 
rim 
. 
after 
a 
few 
moments 
of 
fitting ScrEv_put_new_tire
the 
tire 
to 
the 
rim 
and 
placing ScrEv_put_new_tire
it 
correctly 
on 
, 
i 
was 
able 
to 
test ScrEv_check_new_tire
to 
see UnrelEv_bicycle
if 
the 
tire 
would 
spin RelNScrEv_bicycle
and 
roll RelNScrEv_bicycle
correctly 
. 
i 
rode RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
tire 
around 
for 
a 
few 
minutes 
to 
get UnrelEv_bicycle
a 
feel 
for 
the 
tire 
. 
the 
air 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
low 
, 
so 
i 
had 
to 
pump ScrEv_refill_tire_air
it 
up 
an 
additional 
few 
pounds 
of 
air 
in 
order 
to 
get UnrelEv_bicycle
it 
correct 
. 
the 
entire 
process 
only 
took RelNScrEv_bicycle
me 
about 
ten-to-fifteen 
minutes 
to 
complete UnrelEv_bicycle
, 
and 
i 
had UnrelEv_bicycle
my 
new 
tire 
on 
my 
bike 
in 
no 
time 
. 
<end_of_story>_bicycle 
repairing+a+flat+bike+tire Evoking_bicycle
can 
be UnrelEv_bicycle
a 
little 
tiring UnrelEv_bicycle
, 
if 
you 
get UnrelEv_bicycle
my 
drift 
. 
anyway 
, 
the 
last 
time 
i 
had 
to 
do Evoking_bicycle
this 
was 
when 
i 
'd 
apparently 
ran+over ScrEv_other_bicycle
some 
random 
, 
sharp 
piece 
of 
metal 
that 
got+stuck RelNScrEv_bicycle
in 
my 
front 
tire 
. 
i 
had 
to 
get ScrEv_get_tools
some 
sealant 
and 
a 
little 
oil 
for 
my 
tire 
pump 
. 
i 
flipped ScrEv_lay_bike_down
by 
bike 
upside 
down 
and 
used RelNScrEv_bicycle
a 
wrench 
to 
take ScrEv_free_wheel
the 
whole 
tire 
off 
. 
i 
have UnrelEv_bicycle
an 
older 
bike 
, 
so 
it 
's UnrelEv_bicycle
easier 
to 
do UnrelEv_bicycle
it 
this 
way 
. 
i 
deflated ScrEv_other_bicycle
the 
tire 
and 
then 
i 
took ScrEv_take_tire_off
the 
outer 
tire 
off 
. 
i 
removed ScrEv_other_bicycle
the 
metal 
bit 
from 
the 
tire 
and 
the 
bladder 
. 
i 
sealed ScrEv_put_patch/seal
the 
bladder 
and 
had 
to 
wait ScrEv_other_bicycle
for 
it 
to 
cure RelNScrEv_bicycle
. 
the 
outer 
tire 
got+a ScrEv_put_patch/seal
little 
bit 
of 
repair 
mix 
too 
. 
after 
the 
various 
mixes 
dried RelNScrEv_bicycle
, 
i 
inflated ScrEv_refill_tire_air
the 
bladder 
a 
bit 
and 
put ScrEv_put_new_tire
both 
the 
bladder 
and 
the 
tire 
back 
on 
the 
wheel 
. 
this 
took RelNScrEv_bicycle
a 
while 
, 
since 
i 
had 
to 
make+sure UnrelEv_bicycle
that 
it 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
well 
within 
the 
wheel 
well 
, 
so 
that 
the 
tire 
would 
stay+on RelNScrEv_bicycle
. 
the 
last 
thing 
i 
really 
had 
to 
do UnrelEv_bicycle
was 
fully 
inflate ScrEv_refill_tire_air
the 
bladder 
and 
put ScrEv_put_new_tire
the 
tire 
back 
on 
the 
bike 
. 
it 
took RelNScrEv_bicycle
a 
little 
while 
to 
do 
, 
but 
it 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
better 
than 
buying RelNScrEv_bicycle
an 
all 
new 
tire 
. 
<end_of_story>_bicycle 
this 
weekend 
, 
i 
planned UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
go 
bike 
riding ScrEv_ride_bike
. 
i 
had 
n't 
gone ScrEv_ride_bike
in 
some 
time 
and 
, 
when 
i 
checked ScrEv_other_bicycle
my 
bike 
beforehand 
, 
discovered ScrEv_notice_problem
that 
one 
of 
the 
tires 
had 
gone RelNScrEv_bicycle
flat 
. 
i 
attempted UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
pump ScrEv_other_bicycle
air 
back 
into 
the 
tire 
, 
first 
. 
the 
tire 
would 
not 
hold RelNScrEv_bicycle
air 
, 
so 
i 
knew UnrelEv_bicycle
that 
i 
would 
have 
to 
repair+the+flat+tire Evoking_bicycle
. 
i 
turned ScrEv_lay_bike_down
the 
bike 
upside 
down 
. 
this 
would 
help UnrelEv_bicycle
me 
by 
giving UnrelEv_bicycle
me 
better 
access 
to 
the 
bike 
tires 
. 
i 
found ScrEv_get_tools
a 
wrench 
of 
appropriate 
size 
and 
used RelNScrEv_bicycle
it 
to 
take+off ScrEv_other_bicycle
the 
bolts 
that 
held 
the 
tire 
on 
the 
bike 
. 
when 
i 
had 
taken+off ScrEv_other_bicycle
the 
bolts 
, 
i 
took ScrEv_take_tire_off
the 
tire 
off 
the 
bike 
frame 
. 
then 
, 
i 
let+out ScrEv_other_bicycle
the 
rest 
of 
the 
air 
out 
of 
the 
bike 
tire 
. 
when 
the 
tire 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
completely 
flat 
, 
i 
carefully 
took ScrEv_take_tire_off
the 
rubber 
tire 
off 
the 
metal 
bike 
spoke 
frame 
. 
the 
inside 
of 
a 
bike 
tire 
is UnrelEv_bicycle
hollow 
and 
houses UnrelEv_bicycle
the 
tire 
tube 
. 
i 
knew UnrelEv_bicycle
that 
the 
bike 
tire 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
probably 
flat 
because 
of 
a 
puncture 
in 
the 
bike 
tube 
, 
so 
i 
checked RelNScrEv_bicycle
that 
first 
. 
sure 
enough 
, 
there 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
a 
large 
hole 
in 
my 
bike 
tire 
tube 
. 
this 
tube 
would 
not 
hold RelNScrEv_bicycle
air 
. 
i 
had UnrelEv_bicycle
a 
small 
bike 
tire 
repair 
kit 
in 
my 
garage 
and 
went 
to 
get ScrEv_get_tools
it 
. 
i 
returned UnrelEv_bicycle
with 
it 
and 
took+out ScrEv_get_tools
the 
rubber 
patch 
that 
i 
would 
use UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
repair Evoking_bicycle
the 
tube 
. 
i 
prepared ScrEv_other_bicycle
the 
tube 
and 
then 
applied ScrEv_put_patch/seal
a 
rubber 
patch 
to 
the 
puncture 
with 
a 
bit 
of 
glue 
. 
i 
then 
tested ScrEv_check_new_tire
the 
bike 
tire 
tube 
and 
found UnrelEv_bicycle
that 
the 
patch 
was 
working UnrelEv_bicycle
. 
so 
, 
i 
replaced ScrEv_put_new_tire
the 
tube 
and 
the 
outer 
tire 
on 
the 
metal 
spokes 
. 
then 
, 
i 
put ScrEv_put_new_tire
the 
tire 
back 
on 
the 
bike 
frame 
and 
tightened ScrEv_other_bicycle
the 
bolts 
that 
would 
hold RelNScrEv_bicycle
it 
there 
. 
finally 
, 
i 
put ScrEv_other_bicycle
the 
bike 
right-side 
up 
and 
filled ScrEv_refill_tire_air
the 
tire 
with 
air 
. 
i 
knew 
this 
weekend 
would 
be UnrelEv_bicycle
fun 
. 
<end_of_story>_bicycle 
repairing+a+bicycle Evoking_bicycle
is UnrelEv_bicycle
vital 
and 
i 
learned UnrelEv_bicycle
how 
easy 
and 
important 
it 
is UnrelEv_bicycle
through 
the 
many 
years 
i 
have 
rode ScrEv_ride_bike
bicycles 
. 
first 
of 
all 
do 
not 
think UnrelEv_bicycle
you 
ca 
n't 
do UnrelEv_bicycle
it 
i 
will 
show UnrelEv_bicycle
and 
you 
will 
be 
glad UnrelEv_bicycle
you 
learned UnrelEv_bicycle
the 
first 
time 
a 
tipe 
deflates RelNScrEv_bicycle
way 
out 
on 
a 
country 
or 
something 
. 
first 
use UnrelEv_bicycle
tire 
removing 
tools 
that 
are UnrelEv_bicycle
flat 
and 
will 
not 
pop RelNScrEv_bicycle
tires 
or 
tubes 
and 
have UnrelEv_bicycle
a 
portable 
wrench 
. 
i 
use UnrelEv_bicycle
small 
air 
pressure 
bulbs 
that 
i 
find+are UnrelEv_bicycle
more 
convenient 
to 
use UnrelEv_bicycle
for 
tire 
inflation 
but 
you 
can 
use UnrelEv_bicycle
a 
hand 
pump 
. 
simply 
remove ScrEv_remove_tire
the 
wheel 
and 
place ScrEv_put_new_tire
the 
new 
tube 
in 
the 
tire 
being UnrelEv_bicycle
careful 
to 
look+for ScrEv_other_bicycle
debris 
that 
might 
still 
be 
embedded UnrelEv_bicycle
into 
the 
tire 
still 
. 
then 
carefully 
tuck ScrEv_put_new_tire
the 
tire 
back 
into 
the 
rim 
and 
reinflate ScrEv_refill_tire_air
. 
its UnrelEv_bicycle
a 
real 
good 
thing 
you 
now UnrelEv_bicycle
how 
to 
change RelNScrEv_bicycle
your 
tire 
because 
you 
never 
know UnrelEv_bicycle
when 
a 
tube 
will 
pop RelNScrEv_bicycle
or 
puncture RelNScrEv_bicycle
and 
you 
can 
be UnrelEv_bicycle
out 
of 
luck 
if 
you 
do 
n't 
have UnrelEv_bicycle
your 
spare 
tube 
, 
tools 
, 
and 
pump 
. 
<end_of_story>_bicycle 
if 
you 
love UnrelEv_bicycle
riding ScrEv_ride_bike
bikes 
when 
the 
weather 
starts 
getting UnrelEv_bicycle
better 
an 
important 
thing 
to 
know UnrelEv_bicycle
is 
how 
to 
repair+your+tire Evoking_bicycle
if 
you 
encounter UnrelEv_bicycle
a 
flat 
. 
head ScrEv_other_bicycle
on 
over 
to 
your 
local 
auto 
shop 
and 
find ScrEv_get_tools
a 
patch 
kit 
, 
and 
make+sure UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
invest UnrelEv_bicycle
in 
an 
air 
pump 
if 
you 
do 
n't 
have UnrelEv_bicycle
one 
. 
sometimes 
the 
bike 
tire 
will 
go RelNScrEv_bicycle
flat 
by 
losing RelNScrEv_bicycle
air 
due 
to 
weather 
conditions 
. 
if 
this 
is UnrelEv_bicycle
your 
case 
, 
simply 
unscrew ScrEv_other_bicycle
the 
cap 
and 
pump ScrEv_refill_tire_air
more 
air 
into 
the 
tire 
. 
if 
you 
have UnrelEv_bicycle
a 
puncture 
in 
a 
tire 
then 
you 
will 
need UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
try 
patching ScrEv_put_patch/seal
. 
by 
using UnrelEv_bicycle
the 
kit 
you 
just 
purchased ScrEv_get_tools
you 
can 
find UnrelEv_bicycle
the 
problem 
area 
, 
install ScrEv_put_patch/seal
a 
mesh 
patch 
over 
it 
, 
and 
use UnrelEv_bicycle
the 
kit 
to 
fuse RelNScrEv_bicycle
it 
to 
the 
tire 
. 
once 
it 
has 
been 
applied ScrEv_put_patch/seal
you 
can 
fill ScrEv_refill_tire_air
the 
tire 
with 
air 
and 
enjoy UnrelEv_bicycle
your 
bike 
again 
. 
if 
the 
tire 
is 
still 
losing RelNScrEv_bicycle
air 
then 
you 
will 
unfortunately 
need 
to 
invest RelNScrEv_bicycle
in 
a 
new 
tire 
. 
<end_of_story>_bicycle 
the 
other 
day 
i 
decided UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
take ScrEv_ride_bike
my 
bike 
out 
on 
the 
local 
scenic 
bike 
trail 
. 
a 
few 
miles 
into 
my 
ride 
, 
i 
was 
trying UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
dodge UnrelEv_bicycle
a 
runner 
that 
was 
n't 
paying UnrelEv_bicycle
attention 
and 
i 
ended+up+running UnrelEv_bicycle
over 
a 
piece 
of 
debris 
in 
the 
trail 
. 
i 
started UnrelEv_bicycle
noticing ScrEv_notice_problem
that 
it 
was 
getting UnrelEv_bicycle
harder 
to 
pedal ScrEv_ride_bike
my 
bike 
, 
so 
i 
stopped UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
evaluate UnrelEv_bicycle
the 
situation 
. 
once 
i 
looked UnrelEv_bicycle
at 
the 
tire 
, 
i 
realized ScrEv_notice_problem
it 
was 
flat 
and 
that 
i 
needed UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
repair+it Evoking_bicycle
. 
thankfully 
, 
i 
kept RelNScrEv_bicycle
tire 
repair 
supplies 
in 
my 
bag 
for 
situations 
just 
like 
this 
! 
i 
placed ScrEv_put_patch/seal
a 
temporary 
patch 
on 
the 
tire 
and 
used UnrelEv_bicycle
my 
portable 
pump 
to 
inflate ScrEv_refill_tire_air
it 
again 
. 
i 
set+off UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
ride ScrEv_ride_bike
again 
, 
and 
the 
same 
thing 
happened UnrelEv_bicycle
. 
i 
had 
to 
temporarily 
repair Evoking_bicycle
the 
tire 
three 
more 
times 
just 
to 
make UnrelEv_bicycle
it 
back 
to 
my 
car 
. 
once 
i 
made UnrelEv_bicycle
it 
home 
, 
i 
removed ScrEv_remove_tire
the 
tire 
and 
placed ScrEv_put_new_tire
a 
new 
one 
on 
. 
that 
's UnrelEv_bicycle
how 
i 
repaired+my+flat+bicycle+tire Evoking_bicycle
. 
<end_of_story>_bicycle 
my 
husband 
and 
i 
are UnrelEv_bicycle
huge 
health 
junkies 
. 
we 
ride ScrEv_ride_bike
our 
bikes 
to 
and 
from 
work 
everyday 
. 
yes 
, 
we 
own UnrelEv_bicycle
a 
car 
but 
we 
love+getting UnrelEv_bicycle
that 
extra 
thirty 
minute 
workout 
everyday 
. 
last 
week 
, 
i 
rode ScrEv_ride_bike
over 
a 
piece 
of 
cracked UnrelEv_bicycle
glass 
from 
a 
bottle 
. 
the 
tire 
on 
my 
bike 
slowly 
began UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
deflate RelNScrEv_bicycle
. 
i 
called UnrelEv_bicycle
my 
husband 
to 
come+get UnrelEv_bicycle
me 
and 
we 
took ScrEv_other_bicycle
the 
bike 
home 
to 
get+fixed Evoking_bicycle
. 
i 
washed ScrEv_other_bicycle
it 
with 
soapy 
water 
to 
see UnrelEv_bicycle
where 
the 
hole 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
. 
i 
got+out ScrEv_get_tools
my 
air 
pump 
and 
began UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
pump ScrEv_other_bicycle
. 
the 
part 
where 
there 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
a 
hole 
blew+out RelNScrEv_bicycle
air 
around 
the 
wet 
wheel 
. 
i 
got ScrEv_get_tools
a 
bike 
patch 
and 
just 
stuff ScrEv_put_patch/seal
it 
on 
over 
the 
spot 
once 
the 
wheel 
had 
dried UnrelEv_bicycle
. 
put ScrEv_refill_tire_air
some 
more 
air 
into 
the 
tire 
and 
test+drove ScrEv_ride_bike
it 
around 
the 
street 
and 
back 
. 
my 
sweet 
bicycle 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
back 
and 
even 
better 
than 
ever 
. 
<end_of_story>_bicycle 
to 
be UnrelEv_bicycle
honest 
, 
when 
ever 
i 
have UnrelEv_bicycle
a 
flat 
tire 
on 
anything 
, 
i 
usually 
leave UnrelEv_bicycle
it 
to 
my 
husband 
, 
but 
he 
did 
teach UnrelEv_bicycle
me 
how 
to 
fix+a+flat Evoking_bicycle
on 
a 
bike 
. 
sometimes 
, 
it 
needs UnrelEv_bicycle
a 
new 
inner 
tube 
. 
if 
that 
is UnrelEv_bicycle
the 
issue 
, 
you 
must 
remove ScrEv_take_tire_off
the 
outer 
rubber 
, 
and 
take+off ScrEv_take_tire_off
the 
old 
broken 
inner 
tube 
. 
then 
, 
put ScrEv_put_new_tire
on 
the 
new 
one 
, 
out 
the 
rubber 
back 
on 
, 
and 
fill ScrEv_refill_tire_air
the 
tire 
with 
air 
. 
make 
sure 
that 
you 
check ScrEv_check_new_tire
the 
pressure 
when 
filling ScrEv_refill_tire_air
the 
tire 
so 
as 
to 
not 
put RelNScrEv_bicycle
too 
much 
air 
in 
. 
sometimes 
you 
will 
also 
need UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
chance RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
outer 
tire 
as 
that 
may 
have UnrelEv_bicycle
a 
hole 
. 
it 
can 
be 
hard 
to 
determine UnrelEv_bicycle
which 
part 
of 
the 
tire 
is UnrelEv_bicycle
the 
issue 
when 
you 
have RelNScrEv_bicycle
a 
flat 
. 
first 
, 
you 
can 
check ScrEv_other_bicycle
the 
tire 
pressure 
and 
fill ScrEv_refill_tire_air
it 
if 
low 
. 
if 
it 
quickly 
loses RelNScrEv_bicycle
pressure 
again 
, 
then 
it 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
n't 
just 
an 
issue 
with 
the 
tire 
pressure 
and 
you 
need 
to 
replace RelNScrEv_bicycle
one 
of 
the 
tire 
pieces 
a 
s 
previously 
stated UnrelEv_bicycle
. 
<end_of_story>_bicycle 
sometimes 
, 
something 
happens UnrelEv_bicycle
that 
can 
really 
just 
ruin UnrelEv_bicycle
your 
day 
. 
take UnrelEv_bicycle
, 
for 
example 
, 
going ScrEv_ride_bike
for 
a 
fun 
bicycle 
ride 
only 
to 
have UnrelEv_bicycle
the 
tire 
go RelNScrEv_bicycle
flat 
! 
when 
something 
like 
this 
happens UnrelEv_bicycle
, 
it 
can 
seem UnrelEv_bicycle
like 
a 
big 
deal 
, 
but 
is UnrelEv_bicycle
only 
a 
small 
inconvenience 
. 
i 
do 
n't 
even 
know UnrelEv_bicycle
how 
to 
repair+a+flat+bicycle+tire Evoking_bicycle
, 
but 
i 
know UnrelEv_bicycle
how 
i 
could 
do UnrelEv_bicycle
it 
myself 
. 
first 
, 
i 
would 
read ScrEv_other_bicycle
about 
how 
to 
fix+it Evoking_bicycle
and 
maybe 
look ScrEv_other_bicycle
at 
a 
video 
from 
the 
internet 
. 
after 
i 
have 
learned RelNScrEv_bicycle
how 
to 
repair+it Evoking_bicycle
, 
i 
would 
go UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
the 
store 
to 
get UnrelEv_bicycle
some 
supplies 
. 
i 
would 
need UnrelEv_bicycle
the 
tools 
to 
fix+it Evoking_bicycle
and 
a 
new 
tire 
or 
things 
to 
use UnrelEv_bicycle
for 
the 
repair 
. 
after 
arriving ScrEv_other_bicycle
home 
, 
i 
would 
review ScrEv_other_bicycle
the 
things 
i 
learned RelNScrEv_bicycle
about 
how 
to 
repair 
the 
tire 
and 
i 
would 
follow UnrelEv_bicycle
the 
directions 
. 
once 
it 
was 
repaired Evoking_bicycle
, 
i 
would 
test ScrEv_other_bicycle
out 
the 
bicycle 
to 
make+sure UnrelEv_bicycle
it 
was 
repaired Evoking_bicycle
and 
then 
i 
would 
clean+up ScrEv_other_bicycle
. 
<end_of_story>_bicycle 
as 
i 
was 
riding ScrEv_ride_bike
home 
from 
school 
one 
day 
the 
worst 
possible 
thing 
that 
could 
happen UnrelEv_bicycle
did 
happen UnrelEv_bicycle
. 
my 
tire 
popped ScrEv_other_bicycle
. 
i 
knew UnrelEv_bicycle
i 
was+in UnrelEv_bicycle
deep 
because 
i 
had UnrelEv_bicycle
no 
idea 
how 
to 
repair+a+flat+bicycle+tire Evoking_bicycle
. 
luckily 
my 
grandfather 
did UnrelEv_bicycle
and 
with 
his 
advice 
we 
went UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
get ScrEv_get_tire
a 
new 
tube 
for 
the 
rims 
of 
my 
bike 
's 
tire 
. 
we 
arrive ScrEv_other_bicycle
at 
the 
store 
and 
i 
am 
swamped UnrelEv_bicycle
. 
there 
are UnrelEv_bicycle
so 
many 
different 
kinds 
and 
sizes 
of 
tubes 
. 
well 
luckily 
my 
grandfather 
had UnrelEv_bicycle
already 
looked UnrelEv_bicycle
before 
we 
had 
left UnrelEv_bicycle
and 
knew UnrelEv_bicycle
which 
kind 
we 
needed UnrelEv_bicycle
. 
with 
that 
in 
mind 
we 
purchased ScrEv_get_tools
the 
one 
we 
needed UnrelEv_bicycle
and 
returned UnrelEv_bicycle
home 
ready 
to 
go UnrelEv_bicycle
. 
my 
grandfather 
showed UnrelEv_bicycle
me 
that 
to 
repair Evoking_bicycle
a 
tire 
you 
need 
to 
take+off ScrEv_take_tire_off
the 
old 
broken 
tube 
and 
the 
replace ScrEv_put_new_tire
it 
with 
the 
new 
one 
. 
after 
that 
you 
take ScrEv_get_tools
a 
pump 
and 
pump ScrEv_refill_tire_air
air 
into 
the 
tire 
until 
it 
is 
full 
. 
i 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
n't 
prepared 
last 
time 
for 
my 
tire 
to 
pop RelNScrEv_bicycle
but 
you 
can 
be UnrelEv_bicycle
sure 
that 
i 
will 
be UnrelEv_bicycle
the 
next 
<end_of_story>_bicycle 
today 
i 
found+out ScrEv_notice_problem
my 
bike 
tire 
was RelNScrEv_bicycle
flat 
right 
before 
i 
needed 
to 
ride ScrEv_ride_bike
it 
to 
work 
. 
i 
hurriedly 
flipped ScrEv_lay_bike_down
the 
bike 
upside 
down 
and 
sat ScrEv_lay_bike_down
it 
on 
the 
seat 
. 
i 
pulled ScrEv_loose_nut
quick 
release 
bolt 
on 
the 
tire 
and 
unscrewed ScrEv_loose_nut
it 
. 
i 
disconnected ScrEv_other_bicycle
the 
brakes 
and 
removed ScrEv_take_tire_off
the 
wheel 
from 
the 
bike 
. 
i 
then 
used UnrelEv_bicycle
the 
tire 
removal 
tool 
so 
that 
i 
could 
get+to RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
inner 
tube 
. 
i 
removed ScrEv_take_tire_off
the 
inner 
tube 
, 
and 
examined UnrelEv_bicycle
where 
the 
hole 
might 
be UnrelEv_bicycle
. 
i 
could 
not 
find UnrelEv_bicycle
the 
hole 
so 
i 
put ScrEv_other_bicycle
it 
into 
the 
sink 
with 
water 
. 
i 
found ScrEv_other_bicycle
the 
tiny 
hole 
in 
the 
tube 
. 
i 
used UnrelEv_bicycle
glue 
and 
a 
chunk 
of 
rubber 
from 
an 
old 
inner 
tube 
to 
fix ScrEv_put_patch/seal
the 
puncture 
. 
i 
had 
to 
let UnrelEv_bicycle
it 
dry RelNScrEv_bicycle
for 
a 
few 
minutes 
. 
i 
put ScrEv_other_bicycle
the 
inner 
tube 
back 
onto 
the 
rim 
, 
and 
then 
put ScrEv_other_bicycle
the 
tire 
back 
onto 
the 
rim 
. 
i 
fit ScrEv_other_bicycle
the 
tire 
back 
onto 
the 
bike 
and 
screwed ScrEv_other_bicycle
the 
tire 
on 
and 
rode ScrEv_ride_bike
to 
work 
. 
<end_of_story>_bicycle 
last 
summer 
, 
i 
was 
riding ScrEv_ride_bike
my 
bike 
and 
i 
must 
have 
ran UnrelEv_bicycle
over 
something 
sharp 
because 
my 
tire 
started UnrelEv_bicycle
going RelNScrEv_bicycle
flat 
. 
i 
tried UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
use UnrelEv_bicycle
a 
repair 
kit 
, 
but 
the 
hole 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
too 
big 
and 
the 
patch 
would 
not 
stay RelNScrEv_bicycle
on 
the 
old 
tube 
. 
it 
turns+out UnrelEv_bicycle
that 
i 
ran UnrelEv_bicycle
over 
a 
screw 
and 
it 
had 
been 
lodged RelNScrEv_bicycle
through 
the 
tire 
and 
into 
the 
tube 
. 
i 
knew UnrelEv_bicycle
that 
i 
had UnrelEv_bicycle
a 
twenty 
six 
inch 
wheel 
, 
so 
i 
went ScrEv_other_bicycle
up 
to 
the 
local 
hardware 
store 
. 
they 
had UnrelEv_bicycle
a 
new 
tube 
and 
i 
bought ScrEv_get_tire
a 
new 
tire 
, 
just 
in 
case 
there 
were UnrelEv_bicycle
any 
other 
problems 
. 
i 
followed UnrelEv_bicycle
the 
instructions 
and 
i 
took ScrEv_take_tire_off
the 
old 
tire 
off 
. 
the 
somehow 
got ScrEv_put_new_tire
the 
new 
tube 
and 
tire 
onto 
the 
wheel 
, 
but 
it 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
kind 
of 
a 
pain 
to 
do UnrelEv_bicycle
. 
i 
finally 
got UnrelEv_bicycle
it 
on 
and 
all 
that 
i 
had 
to 
do+was UnrelEv_bicycle
put+in ScrEv_refill_tire_air
some 
air 
. 
i 
plugged+in ScrEv_other_bicycle
my 
air 
compressor 
but 
it 
would 
not 
turn+on UnrelEv_bicycle
for 
some 
reason 
. 
i 
found ScrEv_get_tools
an 
old 
tire 
pump 
buried UnrelEv_bicycle
in 
my 
garage 
and 
i 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
finally 
able 
to 
put ScrEv_refill_tire_air
air 
into 
the 
tires 
. 
in 
the 
future 
, 
i 
am 
going 
to 
be UnrelEv_bicycle
more 
careful 
to 
avoid UnrelEv_bicycle
sharp 
exits 
because 
repairing Evoking_bicycle
the 
flat 
tire 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
a 
pain 
. 
<end_of_story>_bicycle 
yesterday 
on 
my 
way 
home 
from 
work 
i 
heard ScrEv_notice_problem
a 
loud 
popping 
noise 
and 
nearly 
lost UnrelEv_bicycle
control 
of 
my 
bicycle 
. 
after 
coming UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
a 
stop 
i 
noticed ScrEv_notice_problem
that 
my 
tire 
was 
flat 
. 
i 
ended+up UnrelEv_bicycle
having 
to 
walk ScrEv_other_bicycle
my 
bike 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
way 
home 
as 
i 
did 
not 
have UnrelEv_bicycle
any 
tools 
to 
repair+the+tire Evoking_bicycle
on 
the 
spot 
. 
once 
i 
returned ScrEv_other_bicycle
home 
i 
found ScrEv_get_tools
a 
can 
of 
spray 
foam 
that 
i 
thought UnrelEv_bicycle
might 
do UnrelEv_bicycle
the 
trick 
if 
i 
sprayed RelNScrEv_bicycle
it 
into 
the 
tire 
. 
i 
sprayed ScrEv_other_bicycle
the 
foam 
in 
and 
it 
filled RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
inside 
walls 
of 
the 
tire 
. 
i 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
happy 
with 
my 
ingenuity 
, 
although 
i 
knew UnrelEv_bicycle
this 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
only 
a 
temporary 
fix 
and 
i 
should 
probably 
replace RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
tire 
. 
after 
the 
tire 
was 
filled ScrEv_put_patch/seal
i 
hopped+on UnrelEv_bicycle
and 
rode ScrEv_ride_bike
to 
my 
local 
bike 
shop 
where 
i 
purchased ScrEv_get_tire
a 
replacement 
tire 
to 
put ScrEv_put_new_tire
on 
my 
bike 
at 
a 
later 
date 
. 
<end_of_story>_bicycle 
yesterday 
, 
i 
woke+up UnrelEv_bicycle
and 
realized UnrelEv_bicycle
how 
gorgeous 
of 
a 
day 
it 
was 
so 
i 
decided UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
eat UnrelEv_bicycle
my 
breakfast 
and 
then 
go UnrelEv_bicycle
outside 
for 
a 
nice 
bike 
ride 
with 
some 
friends 
at 
the 
park 
. 
when 
i 
went UnrelEv_bicycle
into 
the 
garage 
to 
grab UnrelEv_bicycle
my 
bicycle 
i 
noticed ScrEv_notice_problem
that 
the 
tire 
had 
gone UnrelEv_bicycle
flat 
and 
i 
would 
need 
to 
repair+it Evoking_bicycle
if 
i 
wanted 
to 
go ScrEv_ride_bike
for 
a 
ride 
with 
my 
friends 
. 
i 
called UnrelEv_bicycle
my 
friend 
joey 
up 
and 
asked UnrelEv_bicycle
if 
he 
could 
give UnrelEv_bicycle
me 
a 
half 
hour 
to 
replace+the+tire Evoking_bicycle
. 
joey 
said UnrelEv_bicycle
that 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
fine 
so 
i 
went UnrelEv_bicycle
and 
got ScrEv_get_tools
some 
tools 
and 
a 
spare 
tire 
to 
replace RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
flat 
one 
with 
. 
i 
took ScrEv_take_tire_off
the 
old 
tire 
off 
and 
tightly 
put ScrEv_put_new_tire
the 
new 
one 
on 
. 
to 
make+sure UnrelEv_bicycle
that 
everything 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
in 
place 
i 
took ScrEv_ride_bike
it 
for 
a 
test 
ride 
around 
the 
block 
before 
calling UnrelEv_bicycle
my 
friend 
joey 
back 
and 
letting UnrelEv_bicycle
him 
know UnrelEv_bicycle
that 
i 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
now 
ready 
for 
a 
ride 
. 
after 
that 
i 
went ScrEv_ride_bike
on 
the 
bike 
ride 
and 
everything 
went UnrelEv_bicycle
perfectly 
. 
<end_of_story>_bicycle 
i 
noticed ScrEv_notice_problem
my 
bicycle 
tire 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
flat 
this 
morning 
when 
i 
pulled UnrelEv_bicycle
it 
out 
of 
the 
garage 
to 
go ScrEv_ride_bike
on 
a 
ride 
. 
i 
took UnrelEv_bicycle
the 
bike 
back 
into 
the 
garage 
and 
laid ScrEv_lay_bike_down
it 
on 
it 
's 
side 
. 
i 
thoroughly 
checked ScrEv_other_bicycle
the 
tire 
to 
see UnrelEv_bicycle
what 
had 
caused UnrelEv_bicycle
it 
to 
go RelNScrEv_bicycle
flat 
. 
i 
saw UnrelEv_bicycle
no 
nails 
, 
holes 
or 
tears 
in 
the 
tire 
so 
i 
assumed UnrelEv_bicycle
that 
the 
tire 
had 
simply 
lost RelNScrEv_bicycle
air 
and 
needed UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
be 
refilled RelNScrEv_bicycle
. 
after 
then 
i 
went UnrelEv_bicycle
into 
my 
tool 
chest 
until 
i 
found ScrEv_get_tools
my 
manual 
air 
pump 
. 
i 
took ScrEv_get_tools
the 
pump 
back 
to 
where 
i 
my 
bicycle 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
. 
i 
removed ScrEv_other_bicycle
the 
cap 
on 
the 
tires 
stem 
and 
carefully 
set UnrelEv_bicycle
it 
aside 
. 
i 
then 
inserted ScrEv_other_bicycle
the 
pump 
needle 
into 
the 
stem 
and 
made+sure UnrelEv_bicycle
it 
fit UnrelEv_bicycle
. 
i 
then 
placed ScrEv_other_bicycle
the 
pump 
flat 
on 
the 
ground 
and 
began 
pumping ScrEv_refill_tire_air
air 
into 
the 
tire 
, 
all 
the 
while 
monitoring RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
pressure 
gauge 
. 
when 
i 
saw UnrelEv_bicycle
that 
the 
tire 
was 
properly 
inflated RelNScrEv_bicycle
i 
removed ScrEv_other_bicycle
the 
pump 
from 
the 
tire 
. 
i 
put ScrEv_other_bicycle
the 
stem 
cap 
back 
onto 
the 
tire 
and 
went+out UnrelEv_bicycle
for 
a 
ride 
to 
make+sure UnrelEv_bicycle
the 
tire 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
ok 
. 
<end_of_story>_bicycle 
i 
was 
riding ScrEv_ride_bike
my 
bike 
the 
other 
day 
when 
i 
noticed ScrEv_notice_problem
i 
was 
moving UnrelEv_bicycle
slowly 
, 
even 
though 
i 
was 
pedaling UnrelEv_bicycle
hard 
with 
a 
lot 
of 
effort 
. 
i 
stopped UnrelEv_bicycle
and 
looked UnrelEv_bicycle
at 
my 
front 
wheel 
and 
noticed ScrEv_notice_problem
that 
it 
was 
squished RelNScrEv_bicycle
down 
against 
the 
pavement 
and 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
soft 
when 
i 
pressed RelNScrEv_bicycle
it 
, 
instead 
of 
being UnrelEv_bicycle
firm 
and 
tough 
. 
it 
did 
n't 
have UnrelEv_bicycle
enough 
air 
in 
it 
to 
fill RelNScrEv_bicycle
it 
up 
, 
like 
an 
old 
balloon 
. 
i 
took ScrEv_other_bicycle
the 
bicycle 
home 
to 
my 
garage 
. 
inside 
my 
garage 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
my 
bicycle 
tire 
pump 
. 
the 
pump 
would 
put ScrEv_refill_tire_air
air 
back 
into 
the 
tire 
. 
on 
my 
front 
tire 
, 
there 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
a 
tiny 
tube 
or 
straw 
that 
would 
let UnrelEv_bicycle
the 
air 
in 
when 
i 
used UnrelEv_bicycle
the 
pump 
. 
the 
pump 
also 
had UnrelEv_bicycle
a 
long 
tube 
with 
a 
tiny 
metal 
fastener 
on 
the 
end 
. 
i 
stuck ScrEv_other_bicycle
the 
metal 
part 
into 
the 
tube 
so 
that 
it 
can 
blow ScrEv_refill_tire_air
air 
into 
my 
bicycle 
tire 
. 
the 
large 
metal 
cylinder 
part 
of 
the 
pump 
had UnrelEv_bicycle
a 
handle 
sticking UnrelEv_bicycle
out 
the 
top 
, 
which 
could 
be 
pulled+out UnrelEv_bicycle
like 
a 
pogo 
stick 
, 
and 
two 
little 
metal 
feet 
on 
the 
bottom 
. 
i 
stood UnrelEv_bicycle
on 
the 
metal 
feet 
to 
keep UnrelEv_bicycle
the 
pump 
in 
place 
. 
then 
i 
carefully 
pulled ScrEv_other_bicycle
the 
handle 
out 
and 
pushed ScrEv_other_bicycle
it 
back 
in 
. 
a 
dial 
on 
the 
pump 
showed UnrelEv_bicycle
me 
how 
much 
pressure 
i 
was 
putting RelNScrEv_bicycle
into 
the 
pump 
by 
pushing ScrEv_other_bicycle
on 
the 
handle 
, 
which 
then 
pushed ScrEv_other_bicycle
the 
air 
in 
the 
tire 
. 
i 
heard 
it 
make RelNScrEv_bicycle
a 
hissing 
noise 
. 
i 
kept 
pulling ScrEv_other_bicycle
the 
handle 
out 
and 
pushing ScrEv_other_bicycle
it 
back 
in 
, 
and 
noticed UnrelEv_bicycle
that 
the 
tire 
was 
getting UnrelEv_bicycle
bigger 
and 
bigger 
. 
finally 
, 
after 
a 
few 
minutes 
, 
i 
pushed ScrEv_other_bicycle
on 
the 
tire 
again 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
firm 
and 
ready 
to 
ride ScrEv_ride_bike
. 
i 
disconnected ScrEv_other_bicycle
the 
pump 
and 
put ScrEv_other_bicycle
it 
away 
. 
then 
i 
went+out UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
have 
fun UnrelEv_bicycle
on 
my 
bike 
again 
, 
with 
my 
tire 
working 
perfectly 
. 
<end_of_story>_bicycle 
when 
i 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
younger 
, 
i 
would 
occasionally 
get+flats+on+my+tires Evoking_bicycle
. 
whenever 
it 
happened UnrelEv_bicycle
i 
would 
repair Evoking_bicycle
it 
as 
soon 
as 
i 
had UnrelEv_bicycle
the 
opportunity 
. 
in 
my 
garage 
i 
generally 
used UnrelEv_bicycle
a 
piece 
from 
an 
old 
inner 
tube 
and 
glue 
to 
patch ScrEv_put_patch/seal
the 
hole 
. 
before 
i 
patch ScrEv_put_patch/seal
it 
however 
, 
i 
would 
remove ScrEv_take_tire_off
the 
wheel 
from 
the 
bike 
frame 
using UnrelEv_bicycle
a 
socket 
wrench 
to 
remove ScrEv_loose_nut
the 
nuts 
that 
secure RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
tire 
to 
the 
frame 
. 
then 
i 
would 
remove ScrEv_remove_tire
the 
inner 
tube 
from 
the 
outer 
tire 
. 
then 
i 
would 
put ScrEv_other_bicycle
the 
tube 
in 
a 
pan 
of 
water 
and 
look+for UnrelEv_bicycle
bubbles 
and 
where 
they 
may 
be 
coming+from UnrelEv_bicycle
; 
the 
bubbles 
will 
lead UnrelEv_bicycle
me 
to 
the 
where 
the 
flat 
or 
flats 
are UnrelEv_bicycle
. 
i 
would 
then 
mark ScrEv_other_bicycle
them 
with 
a 
marker 
or 
piece 
of 
tape 
, 
then 
cut ScrEv_other_bicycle
a 
big 
enough 
section 
from 
the 
old 
inner 
tube 
i 
had 
in 
my 
garage 
and 
patch ScrEv_put_patch/seal
with 
the 
proper 
super 
glue 
and 
let UnrelEv_bicycle
it 
sit RelNScrEv_bicycle
for 
at 
least 
an 
hour 
to 
properly 
harden ScrEv_other_bicycle
. 
then 
i 
would 
put ScrEv_put_new_tire
the 
repaired 
inner 
tube 
back 
into 
the 
tire 
, 
put ScrEv_put_new_tire
the 
tire 
back 
onto 
the 
bike 
, 
and 
then 
fill ScrEv_refill_tire_air
the 
tire 
with 
air 
. 
<end_of_story>_bicycle 
one 
day 
when 
i 
was 
riding ScrEv_ride_bike
my 
bicycle 
, 
and 
i 
realized ScrEv_notice_problem
my 
back 
tire 
was 
getting RelNScrEv_bicycle
low 
. 
i 
walked ScrEv_other_bicycle
the 
bicycle 
back 
home 
and 
pulled+out ScrEv_get_tools
my 
patch 
kit 
. 
after 
removing ScrEv_take_tire_off
my 
back 
tire 
from 
the 
bicycle 
i 
let ScrEv_other_bicycle
the 
remaining 
air 
out 
from 
the 
valve 
, 
and 
used UnrelEv_bicycle
the 
small 
tool 
on 
the 
edge 
of 
the 
tire 
, 
to 
lift RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
tire 
away 
and 
clicked ScrEv_other_bicycle
the 
tool 
onto 
one 
of 
the 
spokes 
. 
using UnrelEv_bicycle
more 
of 
the 
tools 
, 
i 
continued UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
lift RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
tire 
away 
from 
the 
rim 
until 
i 
could 
easily 
remove ScrEv_remove_tire
the 
rest 
of 
the 
tire 
with 
my 
fingers 
. 
by 
this 
time 
, 
the 
inner 
tube 
was 
exposed UnrelEv_bicycle
, 
and 
pushing RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
valve 
through 
, 
i 
removed ScrEv_remove_tire
the 
tube 
completely 
from 
the 
tire 
. 
i 
put ScrEv_other_bicycle
the 
tube 
into 
a 
bucket 
of 
water 
, 
and 
used UnrelEv_bicycle
the 
air 
pump 
to 
pump ScrEv_refill_tire_air
air 
back 
into 
the 
tube 
, 
and 
watched UnrelEv_bicycle
for 
bubbles 
to 
see UnrelEv_bicycle
where 
the 
hole 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
. 
i 
kept UnrelEv_bicycle
a 
close 
eye 
on 
where 
the 
hole 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
, 
and 
taking ScrEv_other_bicycle
the 
tube 
out 
of 
the 
bucket 
, 
i 
dried ScrEv_other_bicycle
the 
tube 
with 
a 
towel 
. 
i 
used UnrelEv_bicycle
the 
small 
sandpaper 
from 
the 
kit 
, 
and 
carefully 
roughed ScrEv_other_bicycle
the 
area 
around 
the 
hole 
. 
i 
then 
chose ScrEv_other_bicycle
a 
patch 
. 
a 
round 
one 
for 
a 
puncture 
, 
or 
the 
rectangle 
for 
a 
slice 
. 
i 
placed ScrEv_other_bicycle
glue 
on 
the 
patch 
, 
and 
firmly 
placed ScrEv_put_patch/seal
it 
on 
the 
tube 
. 
i 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
very 
careful 
, 
because 
last 
time 
i 
got UnrelEv_bicycle
glue 
on 
my 
fingers 
, 
and 
my 
fingers 
felt UnrelEv_bicycle
funny 
for 
days 
! 
i 
went+for UnrelEv_bicycle
some 
lemonade 
while 
i 
waited UnrelEv_bicycle
for 
the 
patch 
to 
dry ScrEv_other_bicycle
. 
boy 
, 
that 
lemonade 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
good 
on 
such 
a 
hot 
day 
. 
i 
tried UnrelEv_bicycle
pumping ScrEv_refill_tire_air
some 
air 
back 
in 
the 
tube 
, 
and 
carefully 
watched UnrelEv_bicycle
around 
the 
patch 
, 
to 
make+sure UnrelEv_bicycle
no 
air 
was 
leaking RelNScrEv_bicycle
. 
i 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
in 
luck 
, 
the 
patch 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
good 
. 
i 
carefully 
replaced ScrEv_put_new_tire
the 
tube 
into 
the 
tire 
, 
and 
used+the UnrelEv_bicycle
small 
tools 
to 
replace ScrEv_put_new_tire
the 
tire 
into 
the 
rim 
and 
used UnrelEv_bicycle
the 
air 
pump 
to 
fill ScrEv_refill_tire_air
it 
back 
up 
. 
now 
i 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
ready 
for 
more 
adventures 
! 
<end_of_story>_bicycle 
i 
was 
riding+my+bike Evoking_bicycle
home 
when 
i 
noticed ScrEv_notice_problem
that 
it 
had ScrEv_notice_problem
a 
flat 
tire 
. 
lucky 
for 
me 
there 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
a 
hardware 
store 
near 
by 
. 
i 
walked+in UnrelEv_bicycle
and 
purchased ScrEv_get_tools
a 
patch 
kit 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
only 
a 
few 
dollars 
. 
they 
loaned RelNScrEv_bicycle
me 
a 
chanellock 
to 
get ScrEv_take_tire_off
the 
tire 
off 
. 
it 
came+off ScrEv_take_tire_off
easy 
and 
i 
pulled ScrEv_remove_tire
the 
tire 
off 
the 
rim 
. 
it 
had RelNScrEv_bicycle
a 
nail 
hole 
so 
i 
took ScrEv_get_tools
the 
wire 
scrubber 
in 
the 
repair 
kit 
and 
scruffed+up ScrEv_put_patch/seal
the 
rubber 
. 
i 
applied ScrEv_put_patch/seal
the 
risen 
and 
stuck+on ScrEv_put_patch/seal
the 
patch 
, 
and 
i 
held ScrEv_put_patch/seal
thumb 
pressure 
on 
it 
for 
a 
few 
minutes 
. 
i 
started UnrelEv_bicycle
putting ScrEv_put_new_tire
the 
tire 
back 
on 
the 
rim 
, 
which 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
easy 
i 
got ScrEv_put_new_tire
it 
back 
on 
the 
bike 
. 
lucky 
for 
me 
the 
hardware 
store 
had RelNScrEv_bicycle
a 
portable 
tire 
air 
filler 
and 
i 
was 
able 
to 
fill ScrEv_refill_tire_air
the 
tire 
. 
i 
thanked UnrelEv_bicycle
them 
and 
finished RelNScrEv_bicycle
my 
ride Evoking_bicycle
home 
and 
the 
tire 
did RelNScrEv_bicycle
great 
. 
<end_of_story>_bicycle 
i 
was 
about 
to 
ride+my+bicycle Evoking_bicycle
to 
the 
park 
one 
day 
when 
i 
noticed ScrEv_notice_problem
that 
the 
front 
tire 
was ScrEv_notice_problem
flat 
. 
i 
realized UnrelEv_bicycle
i 
would 
have 
to 
repair Evoking_bicycle
it 
. 
i 
went RelNScrEv_bicycle
into 
my 
garage 
to 
get ScrEv_get_tools
some 
tools 
. 
the 
first 
thing 
i 
did 
was 
remove ScrEv_remove_tire
the 
tire 
by 
unscrewing ScrEv_remove_tire
the 
screws 
that 
were 
holding RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
wheel 
in 
place 
. 
once 
that 
was 
done UnrelEv_bicycle
, 
i 
examined ScrEv_examine_tire
the 
wheel 
to 
see ScrEv_examine_tire
what 
the 
damage 
was RelNScrEv_bicycle
. 
it 
turns+out UnrelEv_bicycle
a 
nail 
must 
have 
punctured ScrEv_other_bicycle
the 
tire 
. 
i 
took ScrEv_get_tools
some 
glue 
and 
proceeded UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
glue ScrEv_put_patch/seal
a 
tube 
patch 
over 
the 
tiny 
hole 
. 
i 
continued UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
apply ScrEv_put_patch/seal
pressure 
to 
the 
tube 
patch 
. 
when 
that 
was 
done UnrelEv_bicycle
, 
i 
inflated ScrEv_refill_tire_air
the 
tire 
back 
to 
fullness 
. 
as 
i 
was 
inflating ScrEv_refill_tire_air
the 
tire 
, 
i 
made+sure ScrEv_check_new_tire
the 
patch 
stayed RelNScrEv_bicycle
in 
place 
. 
i 
then 
reattached ScrEv_put_new_tire
the 
wheel 
back 
on 
the 
bicycle 
and 
it 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
good 
to 
go UnrelEv_bicycle
. 
i 
happily 
took UnrelEv_bicycle
my 
bike 
out 
to 
the 
park 
as 
i 
had 
initially 
wanted UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
. 
<end_of_story>_bicycle 
i 
noticed UnrelEv_bicycle
it 
was 
getting UnrelEv_bicycle
warmer 
out 
and 
it 
would 
be UnrelEv_bicycle
a 
nice 
time 
to 
exercise ScrEv_ride_bike
so 
i 
took RelNScrEv_bicycle
my 
bicycle 
out 
to 
see UnrelEv_bicycle
if 
it 
needed UnrelEv_bicycle
any 
maintenance 
. 
at 
first 
everything 
looked UnrelEv_bicycle
good 
and 
i 
was 
ready 
to 
ride ScrEv_ride_bike
but 
then 
i 
noticed ScrEv_notice_problem
that 
the 
front 
tire 
was RelNScrEv_bicycle
a 
little 
flat 
. 
i 
had RelNScrEv_bicycle
some 
tools 
in 
my 
garage 
so 
i 
picked+up RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
bike 
and 
placed ScrEv_lay_bike_down
it 
on 
my 
workbench 
. 
first 
i 
removed ScrEv_free_wheel
the 
wheel 
and 
checked ScrEv_examine_tire
as 
best 
i 
could UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
make UnrelEv_bicycle
sure 
there 
were UnrelEv_bicycle
no 
tears 
or 
other 
types 
of 
damage 
. 
there 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
just 
a 
very 
small 
tear 
so 
i 
got+out ScrEv_get_tools
the 
patching 
kit 
that 
i 
'd 
purchased ScrEv_get_tools
from 
the 
sports 
store 
last 
summer 
. 
i 
cleaned RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
area 
around 
the 
tear 
and 
applied ScrEv_put_patch/seal
the 
patch 
. 
after 
waiting RelNScrEv_bicycle
for 
a 
while 
, 
i 
put ScrEv_put_new_tire
the 
tire 
back 
on 
my 
bike 
and 
re-inflated ScrEv_refill_tire_air
the 
tire 
. 
the 
patch 
held RelNScrEv_bicycle
and 
i 
was 
able 
to 
go+for+a+bike+ride Evoking_bicycle
that 
day 
. 
<end_of_story>_bicycle 
i 
once 
had+a+flat+tire+on+my+bicycle Evoking_bicycle
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
quite 
a 
surprise 
when 
it 
happened UnrelEv_bicycle
. 
i 
had 
been 
having UnrelEv_bicycle
a 
good 
time 
riding+my+bike Evoking_bicycle
along 
a 
trail 
and 
the 
air 
went RelNScrEv_bicycle
right 
out 
of 
it 
. 
i 
proceeded UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
flip ScrEv_lay_bike_down
my 
bicycle 
over 
so 
it 
was 
standing ScrEv_lay_bike_down
on 
the 
handlebars 
and 
seat UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
inspect ScrEv_examine_tire
the 
damage 
. 
once 
i 
had 
that 
accomplished UnrelEv_bicycle
i 
had 
to 
remove ScrEv_remove_tire
the 
wheel 
from 
the 
bike 
. 
this 
took UnrelEv_bicycle
a 
little 
bit 
and 
i 
needed ScrEv_get_tools
some 
tools 
to 
finish UnrelEv_bicycle
this 
task 
. 
my 
bike 
has RelNScrEv_bicycle
a 
tube 
in 
each 
tire 
to 
keep 
it 
inflated RelNScrEv_bicycle
. 
something 
had 
gone ScrEv_other_bicycle
through 
the 
outer 
rubber 
and 
punctured ScrEv_other_bicycle
that 
inner 
tube 
. 
i 
had 
to 
remove ScrEv_remove_tire
the 
outer 
rubber 
and 
find ScrEv_examine_tire
the 
spot 
on 
the 
inner 
tube 
where 
the 
hole 
was RelNScrEv_bicycle
. 
luckily 
i 
had ScrEv_get_tools
a 
patch 
kit 
with 
me 
and 
was 
able 
to 
patch ScrEv_put_patch/seal
the 
tube 
once 
i 
found ScrEv_notice_problem
the 
hole 
. 
after 
waiting RelNScrEv_bicycle
for 
the 
patch 
adhesive 
to 
set ScrEv_put_patch/seal
i 
put ScrEv_put_new_tire
the 
wheel 
back 
together 
. 
once 
the 
wheel 
was ScrEv_put_new_tire
back 
on 
my 
bike 
i 
was 
off 
riding Evoking_bicycle
again 
. 
<end_of_story>_bicycle 
i 
'd 
had 
my 
old 
bike 
sitting UnrelEv_bicycle
around 
the 
house 
for 
a 
few 
months 
, 
but 
now 
that 
the 
weather 
is 
getting UnrelEv_bicycle
warmer 
i 
decided 
i 
should 
probably 
do+something+about+the+flat+tire Evoking_bicycle
in 
the 
front 
. 
i 
'd 
already 
tried UnrelEv_bicycle
using ScrEv_get_tools
my 
bike 
pump 
; 
it 
would 
inflate ScrEv_refill_tire_air
a 
little 
but 
i 
could 
never 
get 
it 
anywhere 
close 
to 
fully 
inflated ScrEv_refill_tire_air
. 
i 
know UnrelEv_bicycle
from 
past 
experience 
those 
fix-a-flat 
or 
emergency 
bike 
repair 
kits 
are UnrelEv_bicycle
pretty 
worthless 
. 
i 
think UnrelEv_bicycle
they 
're 
made UnrelEv_bicycle
for 
the 
narrow 
old 
tires 
you 
'd 
see UnrelEv_bicycle
on 
ten-speed 
street 
bikes 
. 
i 
have UnrelEv_bicycle
a 
mountain 
bike 
with 
large 
tires 
and 
a 
lot 
of 
pressure 
is 
needed UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
keep 
them 
inflated ScrEv_refill_tire_air
. 
since 
i 
only 
live UnrelEv_bicycle
a 
few 
blocks 
from 
a 
bicycle 
repair 
shop 
i 
decided UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
take ScrEv_other_bicycle
the 
bike 
there 
. 
i 
bought UnrelEv_bicycle
it 
at 
that 
shop 
anyway 
so 
i 
figured UnrelEv_bicycle
they 
'd 
do RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
service 
for 
free 
, 
as 
promised UnrelEv_bicycle
. 
i 
stopped UnrelEv_bicycle
by 
, 
they 
took RelNScrEv_bicycle
it 
in 
the 
back 
, 
replaced ScrEv_put_new_tire
the 
inner 
tube 
of 
the 
tire 
, 
inflated ScrEv_refill_tire_air
it 
, 
and 
it 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
as 
good 
as 
new 
. 
best 
of 
all 
, 
they 
only 
charged UnrelEv_bicycle
me 
ten 
bucks 
for 
the 
tube 
. 
that 
's UnrelEv_bicycle
the 
beauty 
of 
local 
, 
independently 
own 
businesses 
. 
they 
really 
care UnrelEv_bicycle
about 
their 
customers

yesterday 
, 
as 
i 
pulled RelNScrEv_bicycle
my 
bicycle 
out 
of 
the 
garage 
, 
i 
realized 
it 
had+a+flat+tire Evoking_bicycle
. 
so 
, 
i 
prepared UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
repair Evoking_bicycle
it 
. 
first 
, 
i 
went UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
the 
tool 
box 
and 
got+out ScrEv_get_tools
the 
wrench 
and 
other 
necessary 
tools 
. 
then 
, 
i 
realized UnrelEv_bicycle
i 
did 
n't 
have RelNScrEv_bicycle
a 
new 
bike 
tire 
. 
so 
, 
i 
opened UnrelEv_bicycle
the 
door 
to 
my 
car 
and 
got+in UnrelEv_bicycle
. 
i 
drove UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
the 
nearest 
bicycle 
shop 
and 
bought ScrEv_get_tire
two 
new 
bicycle 
tires 
-- 
one 
for 
now 
and 
one 
for 
later 
. 
i 
drove UnrelEv_bicycle
back 
home 
where 
the 
bicycle 
was 
waiting UnrelEv_bicycle
for 
me 
. 
i 
took ScrEv_take_tire_off
the 
old 
, 
flat 
tire 
off 
of 
the 
bicycle 
using ScrEv_get_tools
my 
wrench 
to 
loosen ScrEv_loose_nut
the 
screws 
and 
other 
mechanical 
devices 
. 
i 
then 
stretched ScrEv_put_new_tire
the 
new 
tire 
out 
over 
the 
wheel 
and 
affixed ScrEv_put_new_tire
it 
. 
i 
twirled ScrEv_check_new_tire
it 
around 
and 
tested ScrEv_check_new_tire
it 
to 
make UnrelEv_bicycle
sure 
that 
it 
was 
properly 
fastened ScrEv_other_bicycle
. 
next 
, 
i 
drove ScrEv_check_new_tire
around 
the 
driveway 
to 
make UnrelEv_bicycle
sure 
that 
it 
would 
hold RelNScrEv_bicycle
. 
sure 
enough 
, 
it 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
secure 
and 
ready 
for 
me 
to 
go+on+my+bike+ride Evoking_bicycle
. 
<end_of_story>_bicycle 
yesterday 
, 
i 
found ScrEv_notice_problem
that 
my 
bicycle+tire+was+flat Evoking_bicycle
and 
would 
have 
to 
be 
repaired Evoking_bicycle
. 
first 
, 
i 
went RelNScrEv_bicycle
to 
the 
store 
in 
town 
to 
purchase ScrEv_get_tools
a 
machine 
that 
would 
inflate ScrEv_refill_tire_air
my 
bike 
tire 
. 
next 
, 
i 
went RelNScrEv_bicycle
to 
my 
garage 
, 
which 
is UnrelEv_bicycle
where 
i 
keep RelNScrEv_bicycle
my 
bike 
. 
i 
found RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
nozzle 
in 
the 
bike 
tire 
where 
the 
air 
is 
supposed UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
be 
pumped ScrEv_refill_tire_air
into 
. 
i 
plugged RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
machine 
into 
the 
wall 
socket 
and 
then 
attached RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
nozzle 
from 
the 
machine 
onto 
the 
nozzle 
on 
the 
bike 
. 
i 
hit RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
switch 
, 
which 
caused UnrelEv_bicycle
the 
machine 
to 
beep RelNScrEv_bicycle
as 
it 
added ScrEv_refill_tire_air
air 
into 
the 
tire 
. 
i 
watched RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
gauge 
on 
the 
machine 
to 
make UnrelEv_bicycle
sure 
there 
was RelNScrEv_bicycle
n't 
too 
much 
pressure 
; 
i 
did 
n't 
want UnrelEv_bicycle
my 
tire 
to 
pop UnrelEv_bicycle
like 
a 
balloon 
. 
finally 
, 
when 
i 
saw UnrelEv_bicycle
that 
there 
was RelNScrEv_bicycle
enough 
air 
in 
the 
tire 
, 
i 
turned+off RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
machine 
and 
removed RelNScrEv_bicycle
it 
before 
closing RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
bike 
's 
tire 
nozzle 
tight 
. 
now 
my 
tire 
is UnrelEv_bicycle
good 
as 
new 
and 
i 
can 
ride Evoking_bicycle
around 
wherever 
i 
'd 
like 
to 
go UnrelEv_bicycle
. 
i 
'm UnrelEv_bicycle
glad 
i 
got 
this 
important 
job 
done UnrelEv_bicycle
. 
<end_of_story>_bicycle 
yesterday 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_bicycle
to 
ride+my+bicycle Evoking_bicycle
to 
my 
friends 
house 
. 
the 
weather 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
nice 
and 
i 
had 
n't 
used UnrelEv_bicycle
my 
bicycle 
in 
a 
while 
. 
when 
i 
got RelNScrEv_bicycle
to 
my 
garage 
i 
realized ScrEv_notice_problem
that 
i 
had+a+front+flat+tire Evoking_bicycle
. 
first 
i 
checked ScrEv_examine_tire
if 
there 
were RelNScrEv_bicycle
any 
holes 
in 
my 
tire 
but 
there 
were RelNScrEv_bicycle
n't 
. 
that 
was UnrelEv_bicycle
good 
because 
it 
meant UnrelEv_bicycle
that 
the 
tire 
only 
needed UnrelEv_bicycle
more 
air 
. 
i 
then 
went UnrelEv_bicycle
looking ScrEv_get_tools
for 
the 
air 
pump 
. 
i 
found ScrEv_get_tools
it 
on 
one 
of 
the 
shelves 
. 
i 
took ScrEv_pull_air_pin
the 
cap 
off 
the 
tire 
valve 
. 
i 
put ScrEv_get_tools
the 
pump 
onto 
the 
tire 
valve 
and 
began UnrelEv_bicycle
pumping ScrEv_refill_tire_air
in 
air 
. 
after 
a 
few 
seconds 
i 
grabbed ScrEv_check_new_tire
the 
tire 
to 
see UnrelEv_bicycle
how 
much 
more 
air 
was 
needed UnrelEv_bicycle
. 
i 
did UnrelEv_bicycle
this 
until 
i 
had 
pumped ScrEv_refill_tire_air
it 
up 
enough 
. 
i 
then 
took RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
pump 
off 
the 
valve 
and 
put RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
cap 
back 
onto 
the 
valve 
. 
i 
put RelNScrEv_bicycle
the 
pump 
back 
where 
i 
found ScrEv_get_tools
it 
and 
got+on ScrEv_other_bicycle
my 
bicycle 
. 
i 
cycled Evoking_bicycle
to 
my 
friends 
house 
and 
we 
had UnrelEv_bicycle
a 
fun 
time 
.

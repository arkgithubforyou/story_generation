i 
wanted 
to 
take+a+train+trip Evoking_train
to 
new 
york 
city 
to 
visit RelNScrEv_train
my 
sister 
. 
i 
went ScrEv_get_train_station
to 
the 
amtrak 
station 
in 
boston 
and 
found RelNScrEv_train
the 
ticket 
office 
. 
as 
i 
stood RelNScrEv_train
in 
line 
, 
i 
looked ScrEv_check_time-table
at 
the 
board 
showing UnrelEv_train
all 
the 
departure 
times 
to 
new 
york 
. 
lucky 
for 
me 
, 
there 
was UnrelEv_train
a 
train 
leaving ScrEv_train_departs
in 
half 
an 
hour 
. 
i 
made UnrelEv_train
my 
way 
to 
the 
front 
of 
the 
line 
and 
asked UnrelEv_train
to 
buy ScrEv_get_tickets
a 
ticket 
for 
that 
train 
. 
i 
paid ScrEv_get_tickets
, 
then 
made ScrEv_get_platform
my 
way 
to 
the 
platform 
for 
my 
train 
. 
the 
train 
was UnrelEv_train
already 
there 
, 
so 
i 
looked RelNScrEv_train
on 
my 
ticket 
for 
my 
train 
car 
and 
seat 
number 
, 
then 
hopped ScrEv_get_on
aboard 
. 
i 
settled ScrEv_find_place
into 
my 
seat 
. 
soon 
the 
train 
started UnrelEv_train
moving ScrEv_train_departs
. 
i 
took+out UnrelEv_train
my 
novel 
and 
started UnrelEv_train
reading ScrEv_spend_time_train
, 
only 
interrupted UnrelEv_train
by 
the 
conductor 
coming ScrEv_conductor_checks
to 
check ScrEv_conductor_checks
my 
ticket 
. 
before 
i 
knew UnrelEv_train
it 
, 
we 
were 
pulling ScrEv_arrive_destination
into 
the 
station 
in 
new 
york 
. 
<end_of_story>_train 
instead 
of 
driving+up UnrelEv_train
to 
visit RelNScrEv_train
my 
husband 
's 
sister 
's 
family 
in 
sf 
, 
we 
decided UnrelEv_train
to 
take+the+train Evoking_train
! 
i 
bought ScrEv_get_tickets
the 
tickets 
online 
and 
printed RelNScrEv_train
them 
out 
a 
few 
days 
before 
we 
left RelNScrEv_train
. 
i 
packed RelNScrEv_train
some 
bags 
and 
some 
snacks 
for 
our 
trip 
and 
made UnrelEv_train
some 
plans 
to 
go UnrelEv_train
to 
breakfast 
prior 
to 
departure 
. 
we 
were UnrelEv_train
late 
getting UnrelEv_train
out 
the 
door 
, 
of 
course 
. 
we 
parked UnrelEv_train
our 
car 
and 
got ScrEv_get_train_station
to 
the 
station 
within 
a 
few 
minutes 
-lrb- 
luckily 
! 
-rrb- 
. 
we 
carried UnrelEv_train
our 
suitcases 
onto 
the 
car 
, 
stored RelNScrEv_train
our 
luggage 
appropriately 
, 
and 
took ScrEv_find_place
our 
assigned UnrelEv_train
seats 
. 
i 
gave UnrelEv_train
my 
husband 
his 
ticket 
in 
the 
circumstance 
he 
wandered+off ScrEv_spend_time_train
and 
was 
stopped ScrEv_conductor_checks
by 
an 
attendant 
. 
we 
began UnrelEv_train
to 
talk ScrEv_spend_time_train
about 
what 
we 
wanted 
to 
do UnrelEv_train
on 
our 
visit 
, 
as 
the 
train 
began UnrelEv_train
to 
roll ScrEv_train_departs
away 
from 
the 
station 
. 
he 
decided UnrelEv_train
to 
find UnrelEv_train
us 
coffee 
and 
breakfast 
, 
and 
i 
decided UnrelEv_train
to 
take ScrEv_spend_time_train
a 
quick 
nap 
while 
he 
was UnrelEv_train
gone 
, 
knowing UnrelEv_train
that 
it 
was UnrelEv_train
just 
an 
excuse 
to 
explore ScrEv_spend_time_train
for 
a 
bit 
. 
<end_of_story>_train 
i 
traveled+by+train Evoking_train
to 
a 
visit RelNScrEv_train
a 
friend 
who 
lived UnrelEv_train
a 
few 
hours 
from 
me 
. 
i 
planned UnrelEv_train
to 
stay UnrelEv_train
overnight 
, 
so 
i 
packed RelNScrEv_train
a 
suitcase 
to 
take UnrelEv_train
with 
me 
. 
when 
i 
arrived ScrEv_get_train_station
at 
the 
train 
station 
, 
i 
went RelNScrEv_train
to 
the 
ticket 
counter 
to 
purchase ScrEv_get_tickets
a 
ticket 
. 
i 
looked ScrEv_check_time-table
at 
the 
schedule 
of 
departing ScrEv_train_departs
trains 
and 
selected UnrelEv_train
the 
time 
i 
wanted 
to 
leave ScrEv_train_departs
. 
i 
paid ScrEv_get_tickets
for 
my 
ticket 
and 
waited ScrEv_wait
. 
after 
a 
while 
, 
it 
was UnrelEv_train
time 
for 
my 
train 
to 
depart ScrEv_train_departs
. 
i 
went RelNScrEv_train
to 
the 
front 
of 
the 
train 
with 
other 
passengers 
. 
i 
carried UnrelEv_train
my 
small 
suitcase 
with 
me 
. 
the 
conductor 
took ScrEv_conductor_checks
my 
ticket 
, 
stamped ScrEv_conductor_checks
it 
, 
and 
handed RelNScrEv_train
it 
back 
. 
i 
found ScrEv_find_place
a 
nice 
seat 
by 
the 
window 
and 
settled+in RelNScrEv_train
for 
the 
ride 
. 
when 
everyone 
was UnrelEv_train
aboard 
, 
the 
train 
announcer 
announced RelNScrEv_train
that 
we 
'd 
be 
leaving ScrEv_train_departs
the 
station 
. 
he 
announced RelNScrEv_train
where 
we 
were 
leaving ScrEv_train_departs
from 
, 
and 
the 
final 
destination 
. 
i 
brought UnrelEv_train
a 
book 
with 
me 
to 
read ScrEv_spend_time_train
, 
and 
some 
snacks 
in 
case 
i 
got UnrelEv_train
hungry 
. 
as 
the 
train 
traveled RelNScrEv_train
, 
i 
watched ScrEv_spend_time_train
the 
scenery 
that 
went+by RelNScrEv_train
- 
there 
were UnrelEv_train
small 
houses 
and 
fields 
with 
cows 
. 
i 
enjoyed+seeing UnrelEv_train
places 
i 
had 
n't 
seen UnrelEv_train
before 
. 
after 
a 
few 
hours 
i 
arrived ScrEv_arrive_destination
. 
my 
friend 
picked UnrelEv_train
me 
up 
at 
the 
station 
and 
we 
drove UnrelEv_train
away 
in 
her 
car 
. 
<end_of_story>_train 
i 
like UnrelEv_train
to 
ride+on+trains Evoking_train
because 
you 
can 
see ScrEv_spend_time_train
lots 
of 
countryside 
without 
having 
to 
worry UnrelEv_train
about 
driving UnrelEv_train
. 
one 
time 
, 
when 
i 
lived UnrelEv_train
in 
alaska 
, 
i 
rode+on+a+train Evoking_train
from 
fairbanks 
to 
denali 
park 
. 
just 
like 
with 
all 
train 
rides 
, 
i 
had 
to 
buy ScrEv_get_tickets
a 
ticket 
first 
and 
then 
i 
had 
to 
stand RelNScrEv_train
in 
line 
to 
wait ScrEv_wait
for 
the 
train 
to 
stop ScrEv_train_arrives
at 
the 
station 
. 
then 
i 
climbed ScrEv_get_on
onto 
the 
train 
and 
picked ScrEv_find_place
a 
seat 
. 
the 
different 
places 
you 
can 
sit ScrEv_spend_time_train
in 
a 
train 
are 
called UnrelEv_train
cars 
. 
you 
do 
n't 
have+assigned UnrelEv_train
seats 
like 
on 
a 
plane 
and 
the 
seats 
are UnrelEv_train
wide 
for 
more 
than 
one 
person 
to 
sit ScrEv_spend_time_train
. 
so 
, 
i 
picked ScrEv_find_place
one 
in 
a 
car 
in 
the 
back 
and 
sat ScrEv_spend_time_train
right 
beside 
the 
window 
. 
after 
the 
train 
started UnrelEv_train
moving ScrEv_train_departs
, 
a 
train 
attendant 
walked+through ScrEv_conductor_checks
to 
check ScrEv_conductor_checks
our 
tickets 
and 
then 
i 
stood+up UnrelEv_train
to 
walk+around ScrEv_spend_time_train
. 
you 
can 
walk ScrEv_spend_time_train
from 
car 
to 
car 
on 
a 
train 
and 
can 
even 
go UnrelEv_train
out 
of 
the 
back 
of 
the 
very 
last 
car 
and 
stand ScrEv_spend_time_train
outside 
, 
so 
i 
did UnrelEv_train
that 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_train
very 
fun 
to 
be 
standing ScrEv_spend_time_train
outside 
while 
the 
train 
was 
moving RelNScrEv_train
and 
i 
hung RelNScrEv_train
onto 
the 
railing 
to 
be UnrelEv_train
sure 
i 
was UnrelEv_train
safe 
. 
then 
i 
went ScrEv_spend_time_train
back 
inside 
and 
went ScrEv_spend_time_train
to 
the 
dining 
car 
where 
i 
bought RelNScrEv_train
a 
sandwich 
and 
water 
. 
after 
i 
got UnrelEv_train
back 
to 
my 
seat 
, 
i 
ate ScrEv_spend_time_train
and 
watched ScrEv_spend_time_train
the 
scenery 
through 
the 
window 
. 
i 
saw ScrEv_spend_time_train
lots 
of 
interesting 
things 
including UnrelEv_train
a 
moose 
and 
we 
arrived ScrEv_arrive_destination
at 
denali 
right 
after 
that 
. 
<end_of_story>_train 
last 
summer 
, 
i 
got UnrelEv_train
to 
visit RelNScrEv_train
my 
grandma 
in 
seattle 
! 
i 
took+a+train Evoking_train
to 
visit RelNScrEv_train
her 
. 
in 
advance 
, 
i 
called RelNScrEv_train
the 
train 
station 
to 
see ScrEv_check_time-table
when 
the 
trains 
would 
be 
going RelNScrEv_train
to 
seattle 
and 
how 
much 
the 
tickets 
would 
cost RelNScrEv_train
. 
i 
chose RelNScrEv_train
a 
day 
and 
arrived ScrEv_get_train_station
at 
the 
train 
station 
523 
hour 
before 
my 
train 
was 
scheduled UnrelEv_train
to 
leave ScrEv_train_departs
. 
there 
was UnrelEv_train
a 
ticket 
counter 
in 
the 
station 
. 
i 
walked RelNScrEv_train
up 
the 
counter 
and 
bought ScrEv_get_tickets
my 
ticket 
from 
a 
lady 
behind 
the 
counter 
. 
after 
i 
got ScrEv_get_tickets
my 
ticket 
, 
i 
needed 
to 
wait ScrEv_wait
for 
the 
train 
to 
board ScrEv_get_on
passengers 
. 
i 
sat ScrEv_wait
on 
a 
big 
wooden 
bench 
inside 
the 
train 
station 
. 
when 
it 
was UnrelEv_train
time 
to 
get+on ScrEv_get_on
the 
train 
, 
the 
doors 
opened RelNScrEv_train
and 
a 
ticketperson 
took RelNScrEv_train
each 
of 
our 
tickets 
as 
we 
got+on ScrEv_get_on
the 
train 
. 
we 
got UnrelEv_train
to 
choose ScrEv_find_place
our 
seats 
. 
i 
choose ScrEv_find_place
a 
window 
seat 
and 
put RelNScrEv_train
my 
bags 
in 
the 
compartment 
nearby 
. 
partway 
through 
the 
ride 
, 
a 
train 
employee 
came+by RelNScrEv_train
with 
snacks 
and 
drinks 
. 
i 
looked ScrEv_spend_time_train
out 
the 
window 
and 
read ScrEv_spend_time_train
a 
book 
. 
when 
we 
arrived ScrEv_arrive_destination
in 
seattle 
, 
i 
grabbed RelNScrEv_train
my 
bags 
from 
the 
baggage 
compartment 
, 
exited ScrEv_get_off
the 
train 
, 
and 
hugged UnrelEv_train
my 
waiting UnrelEv_train
grandma 
! 
<end_of_story>_train 
last 
night 
, 
i 
booked ScrEv_get_tickets
my 
ticket 
to 
boston 
. 
i 
got RelNScrEv_train
on 
the 
computer 
and 
found ScrEv_check_time-table
the 
next 
available 
train 
and 
purchased ScrEv_get_tickets
my 
ticket 
. 
i 
packed RelNScrEv_train
my 
bag 
and 
printed RelNScrEv_train
my 
purchase 
confirmation 
. 
this 
morning 
, 
i 
headed ScrEv_get_train_station
to 
the 
train 
station 
. 
i 
handed RelNScrEv_train
my 
receipt 
to 
the 
clerk 
and 
he 
handed RelNScrEv_train
me 
my 
ticket 
. 
my 
train 
was 
scheduled UnrelEv_train
to 
depart ScrEv_train_departs
at 
8:00 
am 
. 
i 
checked UnrelEv_train
my 
watch 
and 
saw 
it 
was UnrelEv_train
7:35 
am 
. 
i 
quickly 
headed ScrEv_get_platform
to 
the 
gate 
where 
my 
train 
was UnrelEv_train
. 
i 
approached ScrEv_get_platform
the 
gate 
and 
handed RelNScrEv_train
my 
ticket 
over 
. 
i 
was UnrelEv_train
easily 
able 
to 
board ScrEv_get_on
the 
train 
. 
i 
found ScrEv_find_place
my 
seat 
towards 
the 
back 
of 
the 
train 
. 
i 
was UnrelEv_train
happy 
to 
have UnrelEv_train
a 
window 
seat 
so 
i 
could 
view ScrEv_spend_time_train
the 
scenery 
during 
the 
trip 
. 
i 
set RelNScrEv_train
my 
luggage 
aside 
and 
settled RelNScrEv_train
into 
my 
seat 
. 
the 
steward 
came+over RelNScrEv_train
and 
asked RelNScrEv_train
if 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_train
a 
beverage 
. 
i 
said RelNScrEv_train
i 
would 
like UnrelEv_train
a 
water 
. 
she 
quickly 
returned RelNScrEv_train
with 
my 
drink 
. 
shortly 
after 
, 
the 
train 
departed ScrEv_train_departs
. 
i 
was UnrelEv_train
impressed 
with 
the 
scenery 
during 
the 
trip 
. 
i 
also 
chatted ScrEv_spend_time_train
with 
a 
few 
other 
passengers 
and 
enjoyed ScrEv_spend_time_train
a 
quick 
nap 
during 
the 
trip 
. 
after 
about 
two 
hours 
, 
the 
train 
arrived ScrEv_arrive_destination
at 
its 
destination 
. 
i 
gathered RelNScrEv_train
my 
luggage 
and 
got ScrEv_get_off
off 
the 
train 
. 
i 
had 
arrived RelNScrEv_train
in 
boston 
. 
<end_of_story>_train 
to 
go+on+a+train+ride Evoking_train
to 
chicago 
, 
i 
had 
to 
have UnrelEv_train
a 
ticket 
. 
it 
is UnrelEv_train
possible 
to 
buy ScrEv_get_tickets
tickets 
online 
, 
but 
it 
was UnrelEv_train
fun 
to 
go ScrEv_get_train_station
to 
the 
train 
station 
to 
get ScrEv_get_tickets
them 
. 
at 
the 
train 
station 
, 
i 
got RelNScrEv_train
in 
line 
and 
waited RelNScrEv_train
my 
turn 
. 
when 
i 
got UnrelEv_train
to 
the 
window 
, 
i 
told RelNScrEv_train
the 
station 
agent 
where 
i 
wanted 
to 
go RelNScrEv_train
, 
when 
, 
and 
what 
kind 
of 
ticket 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_train
. 
she 
told RelNScrEv_train
me 
how 
much 
i 
had 
to 
pay RelNScrEv_train
. 
you 
can 
pay RelNScrEv_train
with 
cash 
, 
but 
i 
paid RelNScrEv_train
by 
credit 
card 
. 
it 
is UnrelEv_train
a 
long 
trip 
, 
so 
i 
had 
to 
show RelNScrEv_train
my 
identification 
as 
well 
. 
since 
i 
was 
going RelNScrEv_train
in 
an 
hour 
, 
i 
waited ScrEv_wait
for 
the 
train 
. 
you 
can 
wait ScrEv_wait
in 
the 
station 
, 
but 
i 
waited ScrEv_wait
on 
the 
platform 
. 
the 
ticket 
will 
tell UnrelEv_train
which 
platform 
you 
want UnrelEv_train
. 
the 
train 
arrived ScrEv_train_arrives
at 
the 
platform 
in 
plenty 
of 
time 
for 
everyone 
to 
get+on ScrEv_get_on
board 
. 
as 
i 
got+on ScrEv_get_on
, 
i 
showed RelNScrEv_train
my 
ticket 
to 
the 
conductor 
, 
but 
kept UnrelEv_train
it 
. 
then 
i 
found ScrEv_find_place
myself 
a 
nice 
seat 
. 
usually 
, 
young 
able-bodied 
people 
will 
take ScrEv_find_place
the 
upstairs 
seats 
, 
and 
leave UnrelEv_train
the 
downstairs 
seats 
for 
people 
who 
want 
to 
sit+down ScrEv_find_place
right 
away 
. 
soon 
after 
i 
took ScrEv_find_place
my 
seat 
, 
i 
heard UnrelEv_train
someone 
outside 
call UnrelEv_train
, 
all 
aboard 
! 
there 
was UnrelEv_train
a 
gentle 
chugging 
sound 
as 
the 
train 
slowly 
got ScrEv_train_departs
underway 
. 
the 
conductor 
soon 
came ScrEv_conductor_checks
and 
took ScrEv_conductor_checks
my 
ticket 
, 
and 
fastened+up RelNScrEv_train
a 
card 
with 
my 
destination 
by 
my 
seat 
. 
now 
i 
was UnrelEv_train
free 
to 
roam ScrEv_spend_time_train
about 
the 
train 
, 
looking ScrEv_spend_time_train
out 
the 
windows 
and 
watching ScrEv_spend_time_train
the 
countryside 
fly+by UnrelEv_train
. 
each 
stop 
was 
announced RelNScrEv_train
over 
the 
p.a. 
system 
well 
in 
advance 
, 
so 
i 
knew UnrelEv_train
just 
when 
to 
get ScrEv_get_off
off 
the 
train 
. 
when 
i 
heard UnrelEv_train
chicago 
announced RelNScrEv_train
, 
i 
went ScrEv_move_exit
downstairs 
to 
wait RelNScrEv_train
with 
the 
other 
people 
who 
were 
getting+off ScrEv_get_off
there 
. 
we 
were 
all 
standing+up UnrelEv_train
, 
so 
we 
hung+on UnrelEv_train
tight 
. 
when 
the 
train 
doors 
opened RelNScrEv_train
, 
we 
stepped ScrEv_get_off
down 
carefully 
onto 
the 
platform 
in 
chicago 
. 
<end_of_story>_train 
i 
wanted 
to 
take+a+trip+on+a+train Evoking_train
. 
i 
thought UnrelEv_train
it 
would 
be UnrelEv_train
fun 
to 
travel RelNScrEv_train
through 
the 
countryside 
. 
i 
called RelNScrEv_train
the 
train 
directory 
and 
booked ScrEv_get_tickets
a 
ticket 
for 
a 
country 
journey 
day 
trip 
. 
i 
arrived ScrEv_get_train_station
at 
the 
train 
station 
, 
full 
of 
excitement 
. 
i 
handed RelNScrEv_train
my 
ticket 
to 
the 
conductor 
. 
i 
found ScrEv_find_place
my 
seat 
which 
was UnrelEv_train
near 
a 
window 
, 
so 
i 
would 
be 
able 
to 
take+in ScrEv_spend_time_train
all 
the 
sights 
as 
the 
train 
traveled+along RelNScrEv_train
. 
after 
the 
train 
car 
was 
filled UnrelEv_train
, 
the 
conductor 
told RelNScrEv_train
us 
that 
we 
would 
be 
departing ScrEv_train_departs
on 
our 
journey 
and 
when 
we 
would 
arrive ScrEv_arrive_destination
at 
our 
destination 
. 
the 
train 
lurched ScrEv_train_departs
forward 
with 
a 
mighty 
gust 
and 
began UnrelEv_train
to 
chug+along ScrEv_train_departs
. 
i 
could 
hear UnrelEv_train
the 
wheels 
clacking UnrelEv_train
across 
the 
tracks 
as 
i 
enjoyed ScrEv_spend_time_train
the 
lovely 
scenery 
that 
was 
passing+by UnrelEv_train
. 
when 
we 
arrived ScrEv_arrive_destination
at 
the 
destination 
, 
we 
approached RelNScrEv_train
the 
station 
and 
the 
train 
screeched UnrelEv_train
to 
a 
stop 
. 
i 
exited ScrEv_get_off
the 
train 
filled UnrelEv_train
with 
wonderful 
thoughts 
about 
my 
experience 
. 
<end_of_story>_train 
i 
recently 
was 
able 
to 
enjoy UnrelEv_train
the 
privilege 
of 
riding+a+train Evoking_train
. 
my 
friend 
and 
i 
had UnrelEv_train
quite 
a 
distance 
to 
travel RelNScrEv_train
. 
after 
some 
discuss 
with 
several 
option 
we 
decided UnrelEv_train
to 
take+a+train Evoking_train
to 
our 
destination 
. 
we 
found+out RelNScrEv_train
where 
the 
train 
station 
was 
located UnrelEv_train
and 
found RelNScrEv_train
the 
window 
to 
buy ScrEv_get_tickets
a 
ticket 
to 
our 
destination 
. 
we 
had UnrelEv_train
our 
choice 
of 
coaches 
but 
we 
chose RelNScrEv_train
the 
cheapest 
one 
which 
meant UnrelEv_train
hard 
seats 
that 
do 
not 
recline UnrelEv_train
, 
no 
air 
or 
food 
offered UnrelEv_train
in 
our 
car 
section 
. 
i 
had UnrelEv_train
no 
idea 
that 
it 
would 
take UnrelEv_train
523 
hours 
to 
travel RelNScrEv_train
to 
our 
destination 
. 
it 
really 
felt UnrelEv_train
like 
a 
lifetime 
, 
especially 
when 
you 
can 
not 
get ScrEv_spend_time_train
comfortable 
and 
find UnrelEv_train
a 
position 
to 
relax ScrEv_spend_time_train
. 
we 
tried UnrelEv_train
several 
ways 
of 
resting ScrEv_spend_time_train
but 
after 
a 
few 
minutes 
we 
would 
get+up UnrelEv_train
and 
reposition UnrelEv_train
ourselves 
. 
the 
ride 
was UnrelEv_train
nice 
overall 
though 
because 
the 
conductor 
would 
stop RelNScrEv_train
every 
four 
hours 
or 
so 
to 
allow UnrelEv_train
for 
bathroom 
breaks 
and 
food 
purchases 
at 
the 
stops 
. 
we 
took+the+night+train Evoking_train
so 
the 
majority 
of 
the 
time 
we 
would 
not 
able 
to 
enjoy ScrEv_spend_time_train
the 
view 
out 
of 
the 
window 
but 
when 
daylight 
broke UnrelEv_train
and 
we 
were 
able 
to 
see ScrEv_spend_time_train
outside 
it 
made UnrelEv_train
the 
trip 
go+by UnrelEv_train
quicker 
. 
so 
, 
overall 
i 
have 
to 
say UnrelEv_train
that 
it 
was UnrelEv_train
a 
very 
good 
experience 
and 
cheap 
too 
. 
<end_of_story>_train 
i 
was 
traveling RelNScrEv_train
on 
vacation 
a 
few 
months 
ago 
, 
and 
decided UnrelEv_train
to 
take+a+train Evoking_train
to 
my 
destination 
instead 
of 
flying UnrelEv_train
. 
i 
have 
always 
wanted UnrelEv_train
to 
travel+by+train Evoking_train
, 
and 
this 
was UnrelEv_train
a 
good 
opportunity 
. 
i 
went+online UnrelEv_train
to 
look ScrEv_check_time-table
at 
the 
train 
schedules 
. 
there 
were UnrelEv_train
quite 
a 
lot 
of 
them 
, 
so 
it 
took UnrelEv_train
me 
a 
while 
to 
narrow UnrelEv_train
down 
my 
choices 
based UnrelEv_train
on 
when 
i 
wanted 
to 
leave ScrEv_train_departs
and 
then 
arrive ScrEv_arrive_destination
at 
my 
vacation 
destination 
. 
i 
finally 
was 
able 
to 
choose RelNScrEv_train
a 
time 
and 
date 
, 
and 
i 
purchased ScrEv_get_tickets
my 
tickets 
with 
my 
credit 
card 
. 
the 
day 
finally 
arrived UnrelEv_train
to 
take UnrelEv_train
my 
vacation 
. 
i 
went ScrEv_get_train_station
to 
the 
train 
station 
and 
checked+in RelNScrEv_train
with 
the 
railway 
. 
they 
gave RelNScrEv_train
me 
a 
paper 
ticket 
, 
which 
i 
then 
brought UnrelEv_train
to 
the 
rail 
line 
. 
when 
we 
boarded ScrEv_get_on
the 
train 
, 
we 
gave RelNScrEv_train
the 
ticket 
to 
a 
ticket 
taker 
, 
and 
he 
escorted UnrelEv_train
me 
to 
my 
booth 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_train
fun 
and 
exciting 
. 
finally 
after 
all 
the 
passengers 
were UnrelEv_train
on 
board 
, 
we 
were ScrEv_train_departs
off 
. 
the 
train 
seemed UnrelEv_train
a 
bit 
jerky 
in 
the 
motion 
, 
but 
eventually 
it 
smoothed+out UnrelEv_train
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_train
so 
much 
fun 
, 
seeing ScrEv_spend_time_train
all 
of 
the 
towns 
and 
cities 
we 
passed RelNScrEv_train
through 
. 
some 
we 
stopped RelNScrEv_train
at 
and 
some 
we 
just 
passed RelNScrEv_train
through 
. 
people 
would 
get Unclear_train
on 
and 
off 
when 
we 
stopped RelNScrEv_train
. 
i 
was 
able 
to 
purchase RelNScrEv_train
some 
food 
in 
a 
car 
that 
sold UnrelEv_train
sandwiches 
. 
i 
slept ScrEv_spend_time_train
some 
in 
my 
car 
, 
which 
was UnrelEv_train
a 
bit 
uncomfortable 
, 
but 
i 
did 
n't 
mind UnrelEv_train
. 
before 
i 
knew UnrelEv_train
it 
, 
we 
had 
arrived ScrEv_arrive_destination
at 
my 
vacation 
destination 
. 
i 
was UnrelEv_train
really 
glad 
that 
i 
had 
taken+a+train Evoking_train
, 
and 
was 
able 
to 
see ScrEv_spend_time_train
a 
lot 
of 
our 
beautiful 
country 
. 
<end_of_story>_train 
recently 
i 
was 
invited UnrelEv_train
to 
a 
function 
at 
a 
church 
with 
a 
downtown 
location 
. 
i 
live UnrelEv_train
in 
a 
large 
city 
that 
has UnrelEv_train
trains 
that 
travel RelNScrEv_train
within 
the 
city 
and 
also 
go RelNScrEv_train
to 
nearby 
towns 
. 
there 
are UnrelEv_train
several 
routes 
that 
the 
trains 
travel RelNScrEv_train
called 
lines 
and 
they 
are 
named UnrelEv_train
by 
colors 
: 
red 
, 
green 
and 
orange 
. 
this 
is UnrelEv_train
so 
passengers 
know UnrelEv_train
what 
train 
to 
take Evoking_train
to 
get RelNScrEv_train
where 
they 
want 
to 
go RelNScrEv_train
. 
the 
last 
time 
i 
went UnrelEv_train
to 
that 
church 
i 
had UnrelEv_train
a 
lot 
of 
trouble 
finding UnrelEv_train
a 
parking 
spot 
, 
so 
i 
decided UnrelEv_train
to 
take+the+train Evoking_train
there 
. 
i 
knew UnrelEv_train
that 
the 
train 
station 
was UnrelEv_train
only 
a 
few 
blocks 
away 
from 
the 
church 
so 
it 
would 
be UnrelEv_train
easy 
to 
get RelNScrEv_train
to 
the 
church 
. 
i 
drove ScrEv_get_train_station
to 
the 
train 
station 
closest 
to 
my 
house 
, 
and 
parked UnrelEv_train
the 
car 
in 
the 
parking 
lot 
. 
i 
walked ScrEv_get_train_station
to 
the 
station 
, 
where 
there 
were UnrelEv_train
many 
benches 
for 
passengers 
to 
sit RelNScrEv_train
while 
they 
waited ScrEv_wait
for 
their 
trains 
. 
there 
was UnrelEv_train
a 
machine 
on 
the 
platform 
that 
let UnrelEv_train
you 
choose UnrelEv_train
what 
type 
of 
ticket 
you 
needed UnrelEv_train
. 
you 
could 
buy ScrEv_get_tickets
a 
ticket 
for 
only 
going RelNScrEv_train
one 
way 
or 
a 
round 
trip 
. 
i 
chose ScrEv_get_tickets
the 
round 
trip 
ticket 
since 
i 
wanted 
to 
take+the+train Evoking_train
to 
the 
church 
and 
back 
again 
. 
the 
machine 
had UnrelEv_train
a 
display 
that 
told UnrelEv_train
me 
how 
much 
money 
i 
needed 
to 
deposit ScrEv_get_tickets
in 
the 
little 
slot 
. 
i 
put ScrEv_get_tickets
the 
money 
in 
the 
machine 
and 
my 
ticket 
popped+out UnrelEv_train
. 
i 
waited ScrEv_wait
for 
my 
train 
to 
arrive ScrEv_train_arrives
. 
when 
it 
did UnrelEv_train
, 
the 
doors 
opened ScrEv_door_opens
and 
lots 
of 
people 
got+off ScrEv_get_off
the 
train 
. 
i 
got+on ScrEv_get_on
and 
everyone 
who 
was 
waiting ScrEv_wait
for 
the 
train 
got+on ScrEv_get_on
, 
too 
. 
i 
looked+for RelNScrEv_train
a 
seat 
. 
i 
picked ScrEv_find_place
a 
seat 
that 
was 
facing UnrelEv_train
forward 
, 
but 
there 
were UnrelEv_train
seats 
that 
faced UnrelEv_train
the 
center 
of 
the 
train 
and 
even 
ones 
that 
faced UnrelEv_train
backward 
. 
the 
train 
's 
doors 
shut RelNScrEv_train
and 
the 
train 
started UnrelEv_train
to 
move ScrEv_train_departs
along 
the 
rail 
. 
it 
went RelNScrEv_train
very 
fast 
. 
the 
train 
had UnrelEv_train
windows 
on 
both 
sides 
and 
i 
looked+out ScrEv_spend_time_train
at 
the 
sights 
as 
we 
sped+along RelNScrEv_train
. 
in 
a 
few 
minutes 
it 
stopped RelNScrEv_train
at 
another 
station 
, 
and 
some 
people 
got+off ScrEv_get_off
and 
others 
got+on ScrEv_get_on
. 
pretty 
soon 
the 
conductor 
walked ScrEv_conductor_checks
up 
and 
down 
the 
aisle 
asking RelNScrEv_train
to 
see ScrEv_conductor_checks
everyone 
's 
ticket 
. 
i 
showed ScrEv_conductor_checks
her 
my 
ticket 
and 
she 
nodded UnrelEv_train
and 
smiled UnrelEv_train
. 
at 
the 
next 
station 
, 
the 
train 
stopped RelNScrEv_train
. 
this 
was UnrelEv_train
the 
station 
that 
was UnrelEv_train
closest 
to 
the 
church 
, 
so 
i 
got+off ScrEv_get_off
. 
when 
it 
was UnrelEv_train
time 
to 
go RelNScrEv_train
home 
, 
i 
waited ScrEv_wait
at 
the 
station 
for 
the 
train 
that 
would 
take RelNScrEv_train
me 
home 
again 
. 
taking+the+train Evoking_train
is UnrelEv_train
a 
lot 
of 
fun 
, 
and 
sometimes 
a 
lot 
easier 
than 
driving UnrelEv_train
. 
<end_of_story>_train 
yesterday 
my 
sons 
and 
i 
received UnrelEv_train
an 
invitation 
from 
their 
grandmother 
in 
reno 
to 
come UnrelEv_train
for 
a 
visit 
. 
i 
do 
n't 
really 
like UnrelEv_train
to 
fly UnrelEv_train
on 
an 
airplane 
and 
i 
thought UnrelEv_train
taking+a+train Evoking_train
would 
be UnrelEv_train
a 
great 
way 
for 
my 
young 
sons 
to 
see UnrelEv_train
the 
country 
. 
so 
we 
went ScrEv_get_train_station
to 
the 
train 
station 
and 
bought ScrEv_get_tickets
train 
tickets 
. 
then 
we 
went UnrelEv_train
home 
and 
packed RelNScrEv_train
our 
suitcases 
for 
the 
journey 
. 
the 
next 
day 
we 
went ScrEv_get_train_station
to 
the 
train 
station 
an 
hour 
early 
from 
the 
departure 
time 
. 
we 
gave RelNScrEv_train
our 
tickets 
to 
the 
station 
attendant 
and 
went ScrEv_get_platform
outside 
to 
the 
platform 
to 
wait ScrEv_wait
for 
our 
train 
. 
the 
train 
pulled+in ScrEv_train_arrives
just 
as 
we 
got ScrEv_get_platform
out 
side 
. 
my 
sons 
were UnrelEv_train
very 
excited 
to 
be 
going+across+the+country+by+train Evoking_train
. 
then 
after 
the 
train 
had 
stopped RelNScrEv_train
, 
we 
go ScrEv_get_on
on 
board 
. 
the 
train 
went RelNScrEv_train
across 
the 
country 
and 
the 
landscape 
was UnrelEv_train
beautiful 
! 
three 
days 
later 
we 
arrived ScrEv_arrive_destination
in 
reno 
and 
were 
met UnrelEv_train
by 
their 
grandmother 
at 
the 
train 
station 
. 
<end_of_story>_train 
i 
decided UnrelEv_train
to 
take+the+train Evoking_train
to 
new 
york 
city 
with 
a 
friend 
to 
see UnrelEv_train
a 
show 
and 
eat UnrelEv_train
at 
some 
nice 
restaurants 
. 
first 
i 
checked ScrEv_check_time-table
the 
amtrak 
schedule 
on-line 
to 
see ScrEv_check_time-table
when 
trains 
were 
leaving ScrEv_train_departs
union 
station 
in 
washington 
, 
d.c. 
to 
go RelNScrEv_train
to 
new 
york 
. 
once 
i 
had 
picked+out RelNScrEv_train
the 
time 
that 
suited UnrelEv_train
me 
, 
i 
bought ScrEv_get_tickets
the 
tickets 
on-line 
and 
printed RelNScrEv_train
them 
out 
at 
home 
. 
my 
friend 
and 
i 
took ScrEv_get_train_station
a 
cab 
to 
union 
station 
and 
went RelNScrEv_train
to 
the 
ticket 
window 
with 
our 
pre-printed RelNScrEv_train
tickets 
. 
we 
waited ScrEv_wait
for 
our 
train 
to 
come ScrEv_train_arrives
, 
and 
once 
it 
did UnrelEv_train
we 
got+on ScrEv_get_on
and 
got+seated ScrEv_find_place
. 
the 
train 
ride 
was UnrelEv_train
very 
relaxing UnrelEv_train
and 
was UnrelEv_train
a 
very 
fast 
way 
to 
get RelNScrEv_train
to 
new 
york 
city 
. 
we 
enjoyed ScrEv_spend_time_train
lunch 
while 
we 
were 
riding RelNScrEv_train
. 
once 
the 
train 
arrived ScrEv_arrive_destination
at 
grand 
central 
station 
in 
new 
york 
city 
we 
got+off ScrEv_get_off
and 
hailed UnrelEv_train
a 
cab 
to 
get UnrelEv_train
to 
our 
hotel 
. 
<end_of_story>_train 
i 
bought ScrEv_get_tickets
a 
ticket 
for 
a 
train 
ride 
to 
the 
city 
. 
i 
made+sure UnrelEv_train
i 
was UnrelEv_train
at 
the 
station 
at 
least 
523 
minutes 
early 
so 
that 
i 
would 
not 
miss UnrelEv_train
the 
train 
. 
after 
waiting ScrEv_wait
for 
a 
few 
minutes 
, 
my 
train 
was UnrelEv_train
ready 
to 
be 
boarded ScrEv_get_on
. 
i 
lined+up RelNScrEv_train
with 
the 
other 
passengers 
and 
gave RelNScrEv_train
my 
ticket 
to 
the 
lady 
at 
the 
counter 
. 
we 
all 
boarded ScrEv_get_on
the 
train 
in 
an 
orderly 
fashion 
and 
waited RelNScrEv_train
until 
it 
was UnrelEv_train
time 
to 
depart ScrEv_train_departs
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_train
n't 
too 
long 
until 
it 
was UnrelEv_train
time 
for 
the 
train 
to 
go ScrEv_train_departs
. 
i 
quietly 
sat ScrEv_spend_time_train
by 
the 
window 
seat 
and 
looked ScrEv_spend_time_train
at 
the 
great 
scenery 
outside 
as 
the 
train 
went+by RelNScrEv_train
. 
i 
would 
have 
never 
seen ScrEv_spend_time_train
some 
of 
the 
scenery 
had 
i 
not 
taken+the+train Evoking_train
. 
before 
i 
knew UnrelEv_train
it 
, 
the 
train 
had 
arrived ScrEv_arrive_destination
at 
our 
destination 
in 
the 
city 
. 
i 
am UnrelEv_train
glad 
i 
decided UnrelEv_train
to 
take+the+train Evoking_train
this 
time 
because 
i 
enjoyed UnrelEv_train
it 
. 
<end_of_story>_train 
recently 
, 
i 
traveled RelNScrEv_train
to 
southern 
california 
to 
visit RelNScrEv_train
a 
friend 
of 
mine 
. 
it 
was 
suggested UnrelEv_train
to 
me 
to 
take+the+train Evoking_train
down 
south 
as 
it 
is UnrelEv_train
cheaper 
than 
driving UnrelEv_train
and 
flying UnrelEv_train
. 
i 
looked+up ScrEv_check_time-table
the 
available 
routes 
and 
price 
on 
the 
internet 
and 
found RelNScrEv_train
a 
ticket 
for 
a 
fairly 
cheap 
price 
. 
i 
purchased ScrEv_get_tickets
it 
and 
was UnrelEv_train
very 
excited 
at 
how 
much 
money 
i 
was 
saving UnrelEv_train
. 
i 
packed RelNScrEv_train
my 
ipad 
and 
made+sure UnrelEv_train
all 
of 
my 
electronic 
items 
were UnrelEv_train
charged 
and 
drove ScrEv_get_train_station
to 
the 
train 
station 
. 
i 
waited ScrEv_wait
about 
523 
minutes 
for 
the 
train 
and 
carefully 
boarded ScrEv_get_on
it 
. 
i 
stepped ScrEv_get_on
on 
the 
to 
the 
train 
that 
was UnrelEv_train
n't 
very 
crowded 
and 
found ScrEv_find_place
a 
comfortable 
window 
seat 
next 
to 
an 
old 
man 
. 
i 
stared ScrEv_spend_time_train
out 
the 
window 
and 
read ScrEv_spend_time_train
a 
book 
on 
my 
ipad 
for 
most 
of 
the 
trip 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_train
a 
very 
pleasant 
ride 
. 
when 
we 
arrived ScrEv_arrive_destination
at 
the 
destination 
, 
i 
got+off ScrEv_get_off
of 
the 
train 
and 
called UnrelEv_train
my 
friend 
to 
pick UnrelEv_train
me 
up 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_train
a 
fun 
ride 
. 
<end_of_story>_train 
i 
was UnrelEv_train
excited 
because 
i 
was 
finally 
going 
to 
visit RelNScrEv_train
my 
friends 
in 
long 
island 
. 
whenever 
i 
thought UnrelEv_train
about 
long 
island 
, 
i 
always 
thought UnrelEv_train
about 
great 
gatsby 
and 
the 
wonderful 
homes 
that 
surrounded UnrelEv_train
that 
area 
. 
when 
the 
day 
came UnrelEv_train
to 
visit RelNScrEv_train
them 
, 
i 
boarded UnrelEv_train
a 
subway 
train 
to 
penn 
station 
. 
once 
i 
arrived ScrEv_get_train_station
at 
penn 
station 
, 
i 
looked RelNScrEv_train
for 
a 
machine 
that 
sold UnrelEv_train
tickets 
. 
i 
found RelNScrEv_train
a 
machine 
and 
bought ScrEv_get_tickets
a 
one 
way 
train 
ride 
to 
montauk 
. 
it 
costed UnrelEv_train
me 
about 
523 
dollars 
. 
once 
i 
bought ScrEv_get_tickets
the 
ticket 
, 
i 
looked ScrEv_check_time-table
at 
the 
schedule 
board 
on 
the 
wall 
to 
see ScrEv_check_time-table
when 
my 
train 
would 
arrive ScrEv_train_arrives
and 
what 
track 
number 
it 
was 
located UnrelEv_train
on 
. 
it 
said UnrelEv_train
that 
the 
train 
was 
arriving ScrEv_train_arrives
in 
523 
minutes 
, 
and 
the 
track 
number 
was UnrelEv_train
523 
. 
i 
found ScrEv_get_platform
track 
number 
523 
and 
waited ScrEv_wait
for 
the 
train 
to 
arrive ScrEv_train_arrives
. 
once 
it 
did UnrelEv_train
, 
i 
simply 
waited ScrEv_wait
for 
the 
doors 
to 
open ScrEv_door_opens
and 
got+on ScrEv_get_on
. 
the 
seats 
were UnrelEv_train
super 
comfortable 
and 
i 
found ScrEv_find_place
a 
empty 
seat 
by 
the 
window 
. 
when 
the 
train 
started UnrelEv_train
moving ScrEv_train_departs
, 
a 
conductor 
came+around+collecting ScrEv_conductor_checks
our 
tickets 
. 
someone 
forgot UnrelEv_train
to 
buy ScrEv_get_tickets
a 
ticket 
and 
had 
to 
pay RelNScrEv_train
extra 
money 
to 
buy ScrEv_get_tickets
one 
. 
apparently 
, 
tickets 
are UnrelEv_train
more 
expensive 
on 
the 
train 
. 
once 
i 
reached ScrEv_arrive_destination
my 
destination 
after 
523 
hour 
, 
i 
finally 
got+off ScrEv_get_off
and 
went+off UnrelEv_train
to 
visit RelNScrEv_train
my 
friends 
. 
<end_of_story>_train 
traveling+by+train Evoking_train

be UnrelEv_train
very

are UnrelEv_train
a 
great 
discount 
for 
people 
who 
ride+it Evoking_train
often 
. 
other 
trains 
travel RelNScrEv_train
long 
distances 
. 
perhaps 
you 
do 
n't

to 
fly UnrelEv_train
or

n't 
want

or 
even 
grab ScrEv_spend_time_train
a 
bite

some

also

sleeper 
cars 
so 
travelers 
can 
be UnrelEv_train
well-rested 
when 
they 
arrive ScrEv_arrive_destination
at 
their

there 
are UnrelEv_train
many

great 
option 
for 
getting RelNScrEv_train
from

point 
b 
! 
<end_of_story>_train 
when 
i 
took+the+train Evoking_train
it 
was UnrelEv_train
a 
lot 
of 
work 
. 
first 
i 
had 
to 
buy ScrEv_get_tickets
my 
ticket 
in 
advance 
, 
which 
i 
managed UnrelEv_train
to 
do UnrelEv_train
for 
523 
dollars 
. 
next 
i 
had 
to 
figure+out UnrelEv_train
how 
i 
was 
going 
to 
get ScrEv_get_train_station
to 
my 
train 
, 
which 
i 
decided UnrelEv_train
to 
do+using UnrelEv_train
the 
bus 
. 
after 
figuring UnrelEv_train
that 
it 
would 
take UnrelEv_train
thirty 
minutes 
for 
me 
to 
get ScrEv_get_train_station
to 
the 
train 
i 
decided UnrelEv_train
to 
allow UnrelEv_train
an 
hour 
and 
thirty 
minutes 
to 
be UnrelEv_train
certain 
i 
would 
not 
miss RelNScrEv_train
it 
. 
this 
was UnrelEv_train
a 
smart 
decision 
because 
i 
arrived ScrEv_get_train_station
with 
only 
523 
minutes 
to 
spare UnrelEv_train
, 
being 
burdened UnrelEv_train
by 
all 
my 
luggage 
. 
i 
presented RelNScrEv_train
my 
ticket 
to 
the 
conductor 
and 
got+on ScrEv_get_on
. 
then 
i 
spent ScrEv_spend_time_train
the 
train 
ride 
reading ScrEv_spend_time_train
some 
books 
that 
i 
had 
packed RelNScrEv_train
, 
sleeping ScrEv_spend_time_train
, 
and 
looking ScrEv_spend_time_train
at 
the 
scenery 
. 
while 
it 
was UnrelEv_train
a 
lot 
of 
effort 
to 
take+the+train Evoking_train
, 
in 
the 
end 
i 
found UnrelEv_train
it 
to 
be UnrelEv_train
an 
affordable 
and 
relaxing UnrelEv_train
experience 
<end_of_story>_train 
i 
was 
very 
excited UnrelEv_train
to 
go+on+a+train+trip Evoking_train
. 
i 
went+over RelNScrEv_train
to 
the 
ticket 
counter 
and 
gave ScrEv_get_tickets
the 
teller 
the 
money 
i 
had 
saved RelNScrEv_train
for 
my 
ticket 
. 
i 
could 
hardly 
wait ScrEv_wait
until 
the 
train 
finally 
arrived ScrEv_train_arrives
. 
i 
climbed ScrEv_get_on
aboard 
, 
put RelNScrEv_train
my 
suitcases 
next 
to 
all 
the 
other 
people 
's 
suitcases 
, 
and 
found ScrEv_find_place
a 
seat 
. 
once 
the 
train 
started ScrEv_train_departs
going 
, 
the 
conductor 
came+by RelNScrEv_train
to 
punch ScrEv_conductor_checks
everyone 
's 
tickets 
. 
i 
gladly 
handed RelNScrEv_train
him 
mine 
to 
be 
punched ScrEv_conductor_checks
. 
after 
that 
, 
i 
decided UnrelEv_train
i 
would 
get ScrEv_spend_time_train
some 
lunch 
. 
i 
walked ScrEv_spend_time_train
to 
the 
back 
of 
the 
train 
to 
the 
lunch 
car 
and 
ordered ScrEv_spend_time_train
some 
food 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_train
fun 
to 
eat ScrEv_spend_time_train
while 
watching ScrEv_spend_time_train
the 
world 
pass+by RelNScrEv_train
through 
the 
window 
as 
the 
train 
rolled+down RelNScrEv_train
the 
tracks 
. 
before 
i 
knew UnrelEv_train
it 
, 
we 
had 
arrived ScrEv_arrive_destination
at 
the 
destination 
. 
i 
gathered+up RelNScrEv_train
my 
things 
, 
grabbed RelNScrEv_train
my 
suitcase 
, 
and 
climbed+down ScrEv_get_off
out 
of 
the 
train 
as 
the 
conductor 
gave RelNScrEv_train
me 
a 
hand 
. 
it 
had 
been UnrelEv_train
a 
very 
fun 
trip 
, 
and 
i 
ca 
n't 
wait UnrelEv_train
to 
ride Evoking_train
again 
. 
<end_of_story>_train 
the 
other 
week 
i 
had 
to 
take+a+trip+on+a+train Evoking_train
to 
visit UnrelEv_train
some 
family 
that 
lives UnrelEv_train
down 
south 
. 
once 
i 
bought ScrEv_get_tickets
my 
train 
ticket 
i 
waited ScrEv_wait
with 
a 
big 
group 
of 
people 
for 
the 
train 
to 
come ScrEv_train_arrives
. 
once 
the 
train 
came ScrEv_train_arrives
down 
the 
track 
we 
all 
got ScrEv_get_on
onto 
the 
train 
and 
took ScrEv_find_place
our 
seats 
. 
a 
ticket-man 
came RelNScrEv_train
and 
asked ScrEv_conductor_checks
to 
see ScrEv_conductor_checks
our 
tickets 
and 
make+sure ScrEv_conductor_checks
that 
we 
all 
were 
supposed RelNScrEv_train
to 
be RelNScrEv_train
on 
the 
train 
, 
and 
also 
that 
we 
're RelNScrEv_train
all 
in 
the 
right 
seats 
. 
once 
that 
is 
all 
taken UnrelEv_train
care 
of 
i 
walk ScrEv_spend_time_train
to 
the 
food 
train-car 
and 
get ScrEv_spend_time_train
some 
food 
. 
i 
sit+down ScrEv_spend_time_train
at 
the 
train-car 
table 
and 
eat ScrEv_spend_time_train
my 
food 
. 
the 
food 
is UnrelEv_train
good 
, 
but 
was 
prepared UnrelEv_train
quickly 
. 
after 
i 
eat ScrEv_spend_time_train
my 
food 
i 
throw+away RelNScrEv_train
the 
trash 
from 
my 
meal 
and 
walk+back ScrEv_spend_time_train
to 
my 
seat 
where 
i 
fall ScrEv_spend_time_train
asleep 
for 
a 
little 
while 
and 
then 
when 
i 
wake+up RelNScrEv_train
i 
am ScrEv_arrive_destination
at 
my 
destination 
and 
exit ScrEv_get_off
the 
train 
where 
i 
meet+up RelNScrEv_train
with 
my 
family 
who 
are 
waiting RelNScrEv_train
for 
me 
. 
<end_of_story>_train 
the 
first 
and 
only 
time 
i 
have 
rode+on+a+train Evoking_train
was UnrelEv_train
in 
november 
523 
. 
my 
family 
and 
i 
traveled Evoking_train
to 
carbondale 
illinois 
on 
an 
amtrak 
train 
for 
thanksgiving 
. 
i 
had UnrelEv_train
a 
brother 
who 
attended UnrelEv_train
southern 
illinois 
university 
and 
we 
had UnrelEv_train
dinner 
with 
his 
family 
. 
the 
university 
is 
located UnrelEv_train
near 
carbondale 
. 
i 
remember UnrelEv_train
the 
ride 
being UnrelEv_train
long 
but 
smooth 
. 
my 
sister 
and 
i 
took UnrelEv_train
turns 
sitting ScrEv_find_place
by 
the 
window 
. 
sometimes 
all 
we 
saw RelNScrEv_train
was UnrelEv_train
cornfields 
and 
cattle 
. 
occasionally 
, 
we 
would 
pass RelNScrEv_train
a 
small 
town 
and 
see RelNScrEv_train
people 
at 
different 
stops 
. 
we 
didn 
' 
t 
order ScrEv_spend_time_train
food 
on 
the 
train 
because 
we 
brought RelNScrEv_train
our 
own 
. 
we 
actually 
had 
brought RelNScrEv_train
cakes 
, 
pies 
and 
sandwiches 
to 
carry RelNScrEv_train
us 
over 
. 
we 
shared ScrEv_spend_time_train
our 
food 
with 
the 
people 
around 
us 
. 
the 
whole 
car 
sang ScrEv_spend_time_train
christmas 
carols 
and 
there 
was RelNScrEv_train
plenty 
of 
laughter 
. 
i 
would 
love UnrelEv_train
to 
take+a+train+vacation Evoking_train
and 
travel RelNScrEv_train
from 
the 
west 
coast 
back 
to 
the 
east 
coast 
. 
when 
that 
comes UnrelEv_train
, 
i 
think UnrelEv_train
i 
will 
eat ScrEv_spend_time_train
whatever 
they 
are 
serving RelNScrEv_train
on 
the 
train 
. 
<end_of_story>_train 
i 
took ScrEv_get_train_station
a 
bus 
to 
the 
train 
station 
and 
then 
walked ScrEv_get_train_station
into 
the 
big 
, 
brick 
building 
. 
there 
's UnrelEv_train
a 
bank 
of 
windows 
at 
the 
far 
side 
of 
the 
building 
. 
i 
went+over RelNScrEv_train
to 
one 
of 
them 
and 
asked ScrEv_get_tickets
for 
a 
one 
way 
ticket 
to 
new 
york 
city 
. 
i 
paid ScrEv_get_tickets
for 
the 
ticket 
with 
my 
credit 
card 
and 
then 
went UnrelEv_train
to 
sit ScrEv_wait
on 
the 
hard 
wooden 
booths 
in 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
station 
. 
i 
looked+up ScrEv_check_time-table
at 
the 
huge 
arrival 
screen 
at 
the 
front 
of 
the 
station 
. 
my 
train 
was 
listed ScrEv_check_time-table
there 
with 
a 
number 
of 
others 
. 
it 
said ScrEv_check_time-table
the 
train 
was RelNScrEv_train
on 
time 
and 
would 
arrive ScrEv_train_arrives
at 
the 
station 
soon 
. 
when 
it 
came+in ScrEv_train_arrives
, 
there 
was RelNScrEv_train
an 
announcement 
that 
the 
train 
to 
new 
york 
was 
boarding ScrEv_get_on
. 
i 
got+up RelNScrEv_train
and 
walked ScrEv_get_platform
with 
about 
thirty 
other 
travelers 
down 
some 
stairs 
and 
along 
a 
long 
hallway 
, 
then 
up 
another 
flight 
of 
stairs 
and 
out 
onto 
a 
platform 
. 
the 
train 
was RelNScrEv_train
there 
next 
to 
the 
platform 
with 
its 
doors 
open 
. 
i 
walked ScrEv_get_on
into 
the 
train 
and 
took ScrEv_find_place
a 
seat 
by 
the 
window 
so 
i 
could 
watch ScrEv_spend_time_train
things 
go+by RelNScrEv_train
as 
we 
traveled RelNScrEv_train
. 
soon 
the 
train 
started UnrelEv_train
moving ScrEv_train_departs
along 
the 
tracks 
. 
after 
a 
while 
the 
train 
's 
conductor 
walked+down RelNScrEv_train
the 
aisles 
saying RelNScrEv_train
, 
tickets 
please 
. 
tickets 
. 
over 
and 
over 
. 
i 
handed ScrEv_conductor_checks
him 
my 
ticket 
and 
he 
punched ScrEv_conductor_checks
a 
hole 
in 
it 
and 
put RelNScrEv_train
a 
ticket 
stub 
in 
the 
back 
of 
the 
seat 
in 
front 
of 
me 
. 
when 
the 
train 
got ScrEv_arrive_destination
to 
new 
york 
city 
i 
got+off ScrEv_get_off
the 
train 
and 
walked+out ScrEv_get_off
onto 
one 
of 
the 
platforms 
at 
grand 
central 
station 
. 
<end_of_story>_train 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_train
to 
take+a+trip Evoking_train
to 
washington 
dc 
to 
visit UnrelEv_train
the 
monuments 
. 
the 
quickest 
and 
cheapest 
way 
seemed UnrelEv_train
to 
be UnrelEv_train
by 
train 
. 
i 
purchased ScrEv_get_tickets
a 
ticket 
online 
and 
had 
a 
friend 
drop ScrEv_get_train_station
me 
at 
the 
station 
. 
once 
at 
the 
station 
i 
gave ScrEv_conductor_checks
my 
ticket 
to 
the 
agent 
. 
then 
i 
went UnrelEv_train
and 
sat RelNScrEv_train
in 
the 
lobby 
to 
wait+for ScrEv_wait
it 
to 
arrive ScrEv_train_arrives
. 
once 
the 
train 
arrived ScrEv_train_arrives
i 
boarded ScrEv_get_on
and 
took ScrEv_find_place
my 
seat 
next 
to 
a 
window 
. 
the 
ride 
would 
take RelNScrEv_train
a 
few 
hours 
so 
i 
settled+in ScrEv_spend_time_train
with 
a 
book 
. 
i 
enjoyed UnrelEv_train
watching ScrEv_spend_time_train
the 
countryside 
pass RelNScrEv_train
when 
i 
got+bored UnrelEv_train
with 
the 
book 
. 
when 
i 
went ScrEv_spend_time_train
to 
the 
bathroom 
i 
could 
n't 
get UnrelEv_train
the 
door 
to 
bolt+shut UnrelEv_train
all 
the 
way 
. 
the 
train 
braked RelNScrEv_train
and 
the 
door 
slid UnrelEv_train
open 
and 
i 
had 
to 
stand UnrelEv_train
to 
re-shut UnrelEv_train
it 
. 
a 
passenger 
next 
to 
the 
restroom 
saw UnrelEv_train
my 
butt 
. 
it 
was 
embarrasing UnrelEv_train
and 
i 
did 
n't 
leave RelNScrEv_train
my 
seat 
for 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
ride 
until 
we 
got ScrEv_arrive_destination
to 
dc 
. 
<end_of_story>_train 
recently 
, 
i 
was 
heading RelNScrEv_train
to 
new 
york 
for 
a 
business 
trip 
with 
a 
co-worker 
. 
we 
prefer UnrelEv_train
to 
ride+on+trains Evoking_train
because 
they 
are UnrelEv_train
cheaper 
and 
we 
can 
enjoy ScrEv_spend_time_train
the 
scenery 
along 
the 
way 
. 
we 
arrive ScrEv_get_train_station
at 
the 
train 
station 
at 
5:30 
am 
, 
snacks 
and 
blankets 
in 
tow 
in 
our 
bags 
. 
we 
purchased ScrEv_get_tickets
our 
tickets 
the 
other 
day 
, 
so 
we 
did 
n't 
have 
to 
worry UnrelEv_train
about 
going RelNScrEv_train
to 
a 
booth 
to 
buy ScrEv_get_tickets
any 
. 
we 
went RelNScrEv_train
up 
to 
the 
attendant 
who 
was 
taking ScrEv_conductor_checks
the 
train 
tickets 
to 
allow RelNScrEv_train
people 
on 
board 
, 
and 
we 
handed ScrEv_conductor_checks
him 
ours 
. 
we 
hopped ScrEv_get_on
onto 
the 
train 
and 
took ScrEv_find_place
our 
seats 
towards 
the 
back 
of 
the 
train 
so 
that 
we 
could 
discuss ScrEv_spend_time_train
a 
lot 
of 
what 
we 
were 
going 
to 
say UnrelEv_train
and 
do UnrelEv_train
in 
the 
meetings 
for 
our 
trip 
without 
being 
distracted UnrelEv_train
much 
. 
as 
we 
discussed ScrEv_spend_time_train
our 
plans 
and 
strategies 
, 
we 
'd 
occasionally 
look ScrEv_spend_time_train
out 
the 
window 
and 
see ScrEv_spend_time_train
lush 
trees 
and 
valleys 
, 
animals 
, 
plains 
, 
and 
all 
manner 
of 
environments 
as 
we 
traveled RelNScrEv_train
from 
state 
to 
state 
. 
we 
had 
to 
switch ScrEv_other_train
trains 
a 
few 
times 
at 
different 
stations 
, 
but 
the 
process 
was UnrelEv_train
pretty 
smooth 
and 
it 
is UnrelEv_train
always 
nice 
to 
hear RelNScrEv_train
that 
whistle 
and 
the 
all 
aboard 
! 
when 
we 
arrived ScrEv_arrive_destination
at 
our 
destination 
, 
we 
got+off ScrEv_get_off
of 
the 
train 
, 
exited RelNScrEv_train
the 
train 
station 
, 
and 
made UnrelEv_train
our 
way 
to 
52nd 
street 
in 
our 
rental 
car 
. 
<end_of_story>_train 
today 
i 
decided UnrelEv_train
to 
visit UnrelEv_train
one 
of 
my 
friends 
that 
i 
have 
n't 
seen UnrelEv_train
in 
a 
very 
long 
time 
. 
they 
just 
moved UnrelEv_train
into 
a 
new 
apartment 
and 
they 
invited UnrelEv_train
me 
over 
. 
they 
gave UnrelEv_train
me 
their 
address 
but 
i 
was UnrelEv_train
n't 
sure 
how 
to 
get+there+by+train Evoking_train
. 
the 
first 
thing 
i 
did UnrelEv_train
when 
i 
got ScrEv_get_train_station
to 
the 
train 
station 
was 
see ScrEv_check_time-table
what 
train 
goes RelNScrEv_train
to 
their 
neighborhood 
. 
after 
i 
figured ScrEv_check_time-table
that 
out 
, 
i 
made+sure UnrelEv_train
i 
had RelNScrEv_train
enough 
money 
on 
my 
metro 
card 
to 
pay ScrEv_get_tickets
the 
train 
fare 
. 
after 
going ScrEv_get_platform
through 
the 
turnstile 
i 
waited ScrEv_wait
on 
the 
train 
platform 
for 
the 
train 
to 
enter ScrEv_train_arrives
the 
station 
. 
i 
quickly 
found ScrEv_find_place
a 
seat 
on 
the 
train 
since 
not 
to 
many 
people 
were UnrelEv_train
on 
it 
. 
after 
about 
523 
minutes 
i 
finally 
arrived ScrEv_arrive_destination
at 
the 
stop 
i 
was 
supposed UnrelEv_train
to 
get+off ScrEv_get_off
at 
. 
i 
walked+up RelNScrEv_train
the 
stairs 
and 
exited RelNScrEv_train
the 
train 
station 
and 
walked UnrelEv_train
523 
blocks 
away 
to 
where 
my 
friend 
lives UnrelEv_train
. 
he 
was UnrelEv_train
happy 
to 
see UnrelEv_train
me 
. 
<end_of_story>_train 
i 
ordered ScrEv_get_tickets
my 
train 
tickets 
a 
couple 
days 
before 
after 
planning UnrelEv_train
to 
meet+up UnrelEv_train
with 
family 
. 
i 
had 
them 
printed+out RelNScrEv_train
and 
ready 
to 
use Unclear_train
. 
after 
doing UnrelEv_train
the 
standard 
morning 
routines 
, 
we 
finally 
arrived ScrEv_get_train_station
at 
train 
station 
about 
half 
an 
hour 
early 
to 
make+sure UnrelEv_train
that 
we 
got ScrEv_get_train_station
there 
in 
time 
. 
we 
approached RelNScrEv_train
the 
clerk 
desk 
to 
get RelNScrEv_train
confirmation 
about 
the 
train 
. 
after 
about 
half 
an 
hour 
later 
, 
the 
train 
arrived ScrEv_train_arrives
very 
shortly 
after 
we 
sat+down ScrEv_wait
. 
we 
both 
showed ScrEv_conductor_checks
the 
tickets 
to 
the 
employee 
, 
and 
then 
got+on+the+train Evoking_train
. 
we 
both 
got UnrelEv_train
seated ScrEv_find_place
into 
our 
seats 
with 
our 
luggage 
being 
handled RelNScrEv_train
. 
it 
did 
not 
take UnrelEv_train
for 
the 
train 
to 
take+off ScrEv_train_departs
, 
and 
we 
were UnrelEv_train
on 
our 
way 
. 
while 
the 
train 
ride 
was UnrelEv_train
pretty 
uncomfortable 
, 
the 
sights 
was UnrelEv_train
enjoyable 
. 
the 
ride 
took RelNScrEv_train
about 
a 
couple 
hours 
until 
we 
arrived ScrEv_arrive_destination
at 
our 
destination 
. 
we 
both 
got RelNScrEv_train
our 
luggage 
and 
got+off ScrEv_get_off
the 
train 
. 
<end_of_story>_train 
i 
made+sure UnrelEv_train
to 
look+up ScrEv_check_time-table
the 
train 
schedule 
in 
advance 
to 
make+sure UnrelEv_train
i 
knew UnrelEv_train
which 
train 
i 
needed 
to 
check ScrEv_check_time-table
. 
then 
, 
i 
went UnrelEv_train
a 
day 
early 
to 
purchase ScrEv_get_tickets
my 
tickets 
to 
made+sure UnrelEv_train
i 
had 
them 
, 
since 
this 
was UnrelEv_train
not 
a 
trip 
i 
made RelNScrEv_train
every 
day 
. 
on 
the 
day 
of 
my 
trip 
, 
i 
checked ScrEv_check_time-table
the 
schedule 
to 
make+sure UnrelEv_train
there 
were RelNScrEv_train
no 
delays 
or 
cancellations 
. 
i 
made+sure UnrelEv_train
to 
arrive ScrEv_get_train_station
at 
the 
train 
station 
at 
least 
523 
minutes 
early 
, 
with 
all 
my 
bags 
and 
luggage 
. 
i 
boarded ScrEv_get_on
the 
train 
and 
greeted RelNScrEv_train
the 
conductor 
and 
showed ScrEv_conductor_checks
him 
my 
ticket 
. 
then 
, 
i 
picked ScrEv_find_place
a 
spot 
that 
was UnrelEv_train
open 
and 
sat+down ScrEv_find_place
quietly 
. 
since 
this 
train 
had RelNScrEv_train
many 
stops 
, 
i 
needed 
to 
be UnrelEv_train
aware 
of 
when 
my 
stop 
was 
coming+up ScrEv_arrive_destination
so 
i 
would 
not 
miss RelNScrEv_train
it 
. 
as 
my 
stop 
approached ScrEv_arrive_destination
, 
i 
pressed RelNScrEv_train
the 
stop 
request 
button 
and 
started UnrelEv_train
to 
get+up ScrEv_move_exit
. 
once 
the 
train 
stopped ScrEv_arrive_destination
, 
i 
wished RelNScrEv_train
the 
conductor 
a 
nice 
day 
and 
got+off ScrEv_get_off
the 
train 
. 
<end_of_story>_train 
taking+the+train Evoking_train
is UnrelEv_train
an 
efficient 
method 
of 
transportation 
to 
get RelNScrEv_train
from 
place 
to 
place 
. 
before 
taking+the+train Evoking_train
, 
i 
will 
make+sure UnrelEv_train
my 
transit 
card 
has RelNScrEv_train
enough 
fare 
on 
it 
. 
this 
can 
be 
checked RelNScrEv_train
at 
the 
ticketing 
machines 
. 
if 
i 
am UnrelEv_train
low 
, 
i 
will 
top-up ScrEv_get_tickets
the 
card 
with 
more 
money 
. 
once 
this 
is 
all 
set UnrelEv_train
, 
i 
will 
head RelNScrEv_train
towards 
the 
gate 
to 
scan ScrEv_get_tickets
my 
transit 
card 
. 
the 
gates 
will 
open RelNScrEv_train
and 
the 
fare 
will 
be 
collected ScrEv_get_tickets
. 
usually 
i 
already 
know UnrelEv_train
where 
i 
need 
to 
go RelNScrEv_train
, 
but 
in 
case 
i 
do 
not 
know UnrelEv_train
. 
i 
will 
check ScrEv_check_time-table
the 
many 
maps 
posted UnrelEv_train
around 
the 
station 
. 
knowing UnrelEv_train
which 
direction 
the 
train 
heads RelNScrEv_train
towards 
is UnrelEv_train
the 
most 
important 
thing 
as 
you 
do 
n't 
want UnrelEv_train
to 
waste UnrelEv_train
time 
going RelNScrEv_train
the 
wrong 
way 
. 
once 
this 
is 
determined ScrEv_check_time-table
, 
i 
will 
head ScrEv_get_platform
towards 
the 
train 
platform 
and 
wait ScrEv_wait
until 
the 
train 
arrives ScrEv_train_arrives
. 
once 
the 
train 
is ScrEv_train_arrives
here 
, 
i 
am 
all 
set UnrelEv_train
and 
i 
will 
board ScrEv_get_on
the 
train 
and 
get+off ScrEv_get_off
at 
my 
destination 
. 
<end_of_story>_train 
last 
winter 
, 
my 
husband 
and 
i 
took+the+train Evoking_train
to 
chicago 
. 
before 
the 
train 
trip 
, 
we 
had 
to 
check ScrEv_check_time-table
the 
train 
schedule 
to 
find+out ScrEv_check_time-table
what 
choices 
we 
had UnrelEv_train
about 
when 
we 
could 
leave ScrEv_train_departs
. 
we 
found ScrEv_check_time-table
the 
train 
schedule 
on 
the 
world 
wide 
web 
. 
after 
we 
learned ScrEv_check_time-table
that 
there 
were UnrelEv_train
two 
trains 
a 
day 
, 
we 
decided UnrelEv_train
to 
take+the+morning+train Evoking_train
departing ScrEv_train_departs
at 
9:05 
a.m. 
. 
we 
purchased ScrEv_get_tickets
our 
tickets 
by 
paying RelNScrEv_train
with 
a 
credit 
card 
using RelNScrEv_train
the 
amtrak 
web 
site 
. 
after 
we 
paid ScrEv_get_tickets
for 
our 
tickets 
, 
they 
were 
emailed RelNScrEv_train
to 
us 
, 
and 
then 
we 
printed RelNScrEv_train
them 
. 
on 
the 
day 
of 
our 
trip 
, 
we 
drove ScrEv_get_train_station
our 
car 
to 
the 
train 
station 
, 
which 
is UnrelEv_train
about 
523 
miles 
away 
from 
our 
house 
. 
we 
parked RelNScrEv_train
at 
the 
station 
, 
and 
because 
it 
's UnrelEv_train
a 
little 
train 
station 
instead 
of 
a 
big 
city 
, 
we 
did 
n't 
have 
to 
pay UnrelEv_train
for 
parking RelNScrEv_train
. 
we 
took RelNScrEv_train
our 
suitcases 
and 
went ScrEv_get_platform
to 
the 
platform 
, 
where 
other 
people 
were 
waiting ScrEv_wait
. 
eventually 
-lrb- 
a 
little 
late 
-rrb- 
, 
the 
train 
pulled+in ScrEv_train_arrives
. 
there 
were RelNScrEv_train
already 
passengers 
on 
the 
train 
from 
other 
stops 
. 
we 
boarded ScrEv_get_on
the 
train 
and 
found ScrEv_find_place
two 
seats 
near 
each 
other 
. 
throughout 
the 
train 
trip 
, 
we 
chatted ScrEv_spend_time_train
with 
each 
other 
, 
and 
we 
also 
talked ScrEv_spend_time_train
to 
one 
of 
the 
other 
passengers 
, 
who 
was 
confused UnrelEv_train
about 
the 
train 
backing+up RelNScrEv_train
. 
we 
explained ScrEv_spend_time_train
to 
him 
that 
sometimes 
they 
have 
to 
do UnrelEv_train
that 
at 
the 
stations 
, 
and 
it 
was UnrelEv_train
nothing 
to 
be 
concerned UnrelEv_train
about 
. 
the 
train 
pulled ScrEv_arrive_destination
into 
the 
station 
at 
chicago 
about 
523 
minutes 
late 
, 
which 
is UnrelEv_train
very 
typical 
in 
chicago 
. 
we 
got+off ScrEv_get_off
the 
train 
and 
were UnrelEv_train
happy 
to 
stretch UnrelEv_train
our 
legs 
. 
<end_of_story>_train 
some 
people 
ride+the+train Evoking_train
every 
day 
as 
part 
of 
their 
work 
commute 
, 
while 
others 
only 
have UnrelEv_train
the 
opportunity 
to 
ride Evoking_train
for 
vacation 
or 
pleasure 
. 
i 
spend UnrelEv_train
quite 
a 
good 
amount 
of 
time 
researching ScrEv_check_time-table
routes 
and 
fares 
before 
i 
decide UnrelEv_train
on 
the 
best 
options 
for 
me 
. 
one 
of 
the 
benefits 
of 
riding+the+train Evoking_train
is UnrelEv_train
a 
feeling 
of 
a 
connection 
to 
the 
past 
. 
i 
feel UnrelEv_train
like 
i 
'm 
partaking UnrelEv_train
in 
a 
part 
of 
our 
shared UnrelEv_train
history 
, 
something 
people 
have 
been 
doing UnrelEv_train
for 
hundreds 
of 
years 
. 
i 
enjoy UnrelEv_train
sitting ScrEv_find_place
by 
the 
window 
and 
watching ScrEv_spend_time_train
the 
scenery 
race RelNScrEv_train
past 
. 
making ScrEv_spend_time_train
small 
talk 
with 
other 
passengers 
is UnrelEv_train
also 
something 
i 
look+forward UnrelEv_train
to 
. 
an 
employee 
comes+by RelNScrEv_train
to 
ensure ScrEv_conductor_checks
that 
everyone 
has 
paid ScrEv_get_tickets
their 
fare 
. 
the 
soothing+rocking UnrelEv_train
motion 
of 
the 
train 
usually 
puts ScrEv_spend_time_train
me 
to 
sleep 
and 
before 
i 
know UnrelEv_train
it 
i 
wake+up RelNScrEv_train
and 
it 
is UnrelEv_train
time 
to 
disembark ScrEv_get_off
from 
the 
train 
. 
<end_of_story>_train 
i 
taking+a+train Evoking_train
today 
from 
boston 
, 
massachusetts 
to 
new 
york 
city 
, 
new 
york 
. 
when 
i 
arrive ScrEv_get_train_station
at 
the 
station 
, 
i 
see UnrelEv_train
an 
automated UnrelEv_train
machine 
that 
lets UnrelEv_train
me 
purchase ScrEv_get_tickets
my 
ticket 
. 
i 
enter RelNScrEv_train
the 
necessary 
information 
about 
my 
travel 
and 
my 
credit 
card 
information 
and 
it 
dispenses ScrEv_get_tickets
a 
ticket 
to 
me 
. 
i 
see ScrEv_check_time-table
that 
my 
train 
is 
leaving ScrEv_train_departs
from 
track 
523 
. 
i 
follow RelNScrEv_train
the 
signs 
above 
me 
that 
show RelNScrEv_train
the 
directions 
to 
all 
of 
the 
track 
locations 
. 
the 
train 
pulls+up ScrEv_train_arrives
about 
523 
minutes 
later 
. 
i 
board ScrEv_get_on
the 
train 
. 
there 
are UnrelEv_train
n't 
too 
many 
empty 
seats 
but 
i 
find ScrEv_find_place
a 
nice 
one 
next 
to 
the 
window 
. 
the 
train 
slowly 
pulls+out ScrEv_train_departs
of 
the 
station 
. 
about 
523 
minutes 
into 
the 
journey 
, 
a 
conductor 
comes+by RelNScrEv_train
and 
asks ScrEv_conductor_checks
to 
see ScrEv_conductor_checks
my 
ticket 
. 
i 
show ScrEv_conductor_checks
it 
to 
him 
and 
he 
punches ScrEv_conductor_checks
a 
hole 
in 
it 
. 
he 
then 
rips+off ScrEv_conductor_checks
part 
of 
it 
and 
places RelNScrEv_train
the 
ripped UnrelEv_train
part 
into 
a 
special 
see 
through 
pocket 
in 
my 
seat 
. 
this 
is UnrelEv_train
so 
he 
knows RelNScrEv_train
that 
i 
have 
paid ScrEv_get_tickets
my 
fare 
to 
ride+the+train Evoking_train
. 
it 
's UnrelEv_train
about 
a 
three 
hour 
train 
ride 
so 
i 
get+up RelNScrEv_train
and 
wander ScrEv_spend_time_train
a 
few 
cars 
down 
to 
the 
food 
train 
. 
i 
purchase ScrEv_spend_time_train
a 
coffee 
and 
donut 
and 
bring RelNScrEv_train
them 
back 
to 
my 
designated RelNScrEv_train
seat 
. 
i 
'm UnrelEv_train
happy 
to 
say UnrelEv_train
that 
there 
is UnrelEv_train
free 
wi-fi 
on 
the 
train 
so 
i 
'm UnrelEv_train
able 
to 
surf ScrEv_spend_time_train
the 
web 
while 
riding+the+train Evoking_train
. 
we 
make ScrEv_other_train
a 
few 
stops 
along 
the 
way 
to 
new 
york 
to 
pick+up ScrEv_get_on
more 
passengers 
and 
let ScrEv_get_off
others 
off 
. 
the 
three 
hours 
pass RelNScrEv_train
quickly 
and 
soon 
i 
'm 
disembarking ScrEv_get_off
the 
train 
to 
enjoy UnrelEv_train
a 
day 
in 
the 
city 
. 
<end_of_story>_train 
my 
family 
decided UnrelEv_train
to 
take+a+train Evoking_train
in 
to 
the 
city 
and 
have UnrelEv_train
an 
afternoon 
of 
shopping UnrelEv_train
. 
we 
went ScrEv_get_train_station
to 
the 
station 
and 
bought ScrEv_get_tickets
tickets 
from 
the 
vending 
machine 
there 
. 
we 
often 
bought ScrEv_get_tickets
the 
ten-trip 
ticket 
because 
it 
was UnrelEv_train
a 
good 
bargain 
. 
then 
we 
had 
to 
wait ScrEv_wait
for 
our 
train 
to 
arrive ScrEv_train_arrives
. 
when 
it 
did UnrelEv_train
, 
we 
stepped ScrEv_get_on
through 
the 
open 
doors 
into 
the 
car 
, 
stepping ScrEv_get_on
carefully 
over 
the 
gap 
between 
the 
platform 
and 
the 
train 
. 
we 
found ScrEv_find_place
ourselves 
a 
nice 
seat 
. 
my 
sister 
took ScrEv_find_place
a 
seat 
by 
the 
window 
because 
she 
always 
likes UnrelEv_train
to 
watch ScrEv_spend_time_train
the 
moving RelNScrEv_train
landscape 
. 
we 
all 
enjoyed ScrEv_spend_time_train
a 
train 
ride 
. 
the 
sound 
of 
the 
wheels 
on 
the 
tracks 
was 
soothing UnrelEv_train
and 
the 
rides 
were UnrelEv_train
n't 
too 
long 
. 
before 
long 
, 
the 
conductor 
came RelNScrEv_train
and 
took ScrEv_conductor_checks
our 
tickets 
. 
she 
was UnrelEv_train
very 
polite 
and 
friendly 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_train
not 
long 
before 
the 
train 
went RelNScrEv_train
into 
the 
tunnel 
and 
we 
knew UnrelEv_train
the 
ride 
was ScrEv_arrive_destination
nearly 
over 
. 
<end_of_story>_train 
i 
had UnrelEv_train
a 
business 
meeting 
in 
san 
fran 
and 
i 
lived UnrelEv_train
in 
san 
jose 
. 
being 
that 
they 
were UnrelEv_train
not 
that 
far 
of 
a 
distance 
i 
decided UnrelEv_train
to 
take+the+train Evoking_train
to 
it 
instead 
of 
flying UnrelEv_train
. 
i 
went RelNScrEv_train
online 
and 
bought ScrEv_get_tickets
my 
train 
ticket 
and 
printed ScrEv_get_tickets
it 
out 
the 
night 
before 
and 
packed RelNScrEv_train
my 
things 
. 
i 
then 
got ScrEv_get_train_station
to 
the 
train 
station 
and 
parked RelNScrEv_train
. 
i 
went+up ScrEv_get_platform
to 
my 
train 
, 
train 
number 
four 
, 
and 
gave ScrEv_conductor_checks
my 
ticket 
to 
the 
conductor 
and 
boarded ScrEv_get_on
the 
train 
. 
i 
was UnrelEv_train
able 
to 
put RelNScrEv_train
my 
suitcase 
in 
the 
overhead 
bin 
and 
sat+down ScrEv_find_place
in 
my 
seat 
which 
to 
my 
surprise 
was UnrelEv_train
quite 
roomy 
. 
very 
different 
from 
the 
cramped UnrelEv_train
seats 
on 
an 
airplane 
. 
they 
even 
had UnrelEv_train
plugs 
in 
the 
seats 
and 
wi-fi 
. 
i 
decided UnrelEv_train
to 
pull+out RelNScrEv_train
my 
laptop 
and 
check ScrEv_spend_time_train
emails 
and 
get UnrelEv_train
some 
work 
done ScrEv_spend_time_train
during 
my 
hour 
and 
a 
half 
train 
ride 
. 
we 
arrived ScrEv_arrive_destination
at 
our 
destination 
and 
i 
got+off ScrEv_get_off
the 
train 
, 
grabbed RelNScrEv_train
my 
things 
and 
caught RelNScrEv_train
a 
taxi 
to 
my 
hotel 
. 
<end_of_story>_train 
last 
month 
i 
decided UnrelEv_train
to 
visit UnrelEv_train
my 
grandmother 
. 
she 
lives UnrelEv_train
about 
three 
hours 
away 
from 
me 
, 
and 
i 
do 
not 
own UnrelEv_train
a 
car 
. 
to 
get UnrelEv_train
to 
her 
house 
safely 
, 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_train
to 
take+a+train Evoking_train
. 
trains 
are UnrelEv_train
a 
very 
affordable 
way 
to 
travel RelNScrEv_train
, 
and 
i 
find UnrelEv_train
them 
to 
be UnrelEv_train
comfortable 
and 
pleasant 
. 
i 
got UnrelEv_train
on 
my 
computer 
, 
and 
went RelNScrEv_train
to 
the 
website 
where 
people 
buy ScrEv_get_tickets
train 
tickets 
. 
i 
chose RelNScrEv_train
a 
date 
to 
leave ScrEv_train_departs
and 
i 
booked ScrEv_get_tickets
my 
tickets 
. 
my 
tickets 
were 
emailed RelNScrEv_train
to 
me 
and 
i 
printed ScrEv_get_tickets
them 
off 
using UnrelEv_train
my 
printer 
. 
a 
week 
later 
, 
i 
went ScrEv_get_train_station
to 
the 
train 
station 
and 
boarded ScrEv_get_on
the 
train 
. 
the 
ride 
was UnrelEv_train
very 
quiet 
, 
so 
i 
took ScrEv_spend_time_train
a 
nap 
part 
of 
the 
ride 
. 
the 
seats 
were UnrelEv_train
very 
comfortable 
. 
i 
went RelNScrEv_train
to 
the 
cafeteria 
cart 
on 
the 
train 
and 
bought ScrEv_spend_time_train
coffee 
. 
i 
enjoyed ScrEv_spend_time_train
the 
coffee 
and 
drank ScrEv_spend_time_train
it 
while 
looking+out ScrEv_spend_time_train
the 
window 
. 
i 
really 
enjoyed UnrelEv_train
the 
whole 
experience 
. 
<end_of_story>_train 
i 
entered RelNScrEv_train
the 
train 
depot 
and 
went+up RelNScrEv_train
to 
the 
window 
. 
i 
asked ScrEv_get_tickets
for 
a 
ticket 
to 
chicago 
. 
i 
paid ScrEv_get_tickets
for 
it 
and 
clerk 
gave ScrEv_get_tickets
me 
my 
ticket 
. 
the 
train 
was 
already 
boarding ScrEv_get_on
, 
so 
i 
went ScrEv_get_platform
directly 
to 
the 
platform 
and 
boarded ScrEv_get_on
. 
i 
went RelNScrEv_train
down 
the 
aisle 
and 
found ScrEv_find_place
an 
empty 
seat 
. 
the 
train 
pulled+out ScrEv_train_departs
of 
the 
station 
. 
after 
a 
few 
minutes 
, 
the 
conductor 
came+by RelNScrEv_train
and 
checked ScrEv_conductor_checks
my 
ticket 
, 
punching ScrEv_conductor_checks
it 
with 
a 
small 
hole 
punch 
. 
i 
looked+out ScrEv_spend_time_train
the 
window 
. 
people 
's 
houses 
and 
huge 
warehouses 
passed+by RelNScrEv_train
. 
later 
, 
as 
we 
got RelNScrEv_train
into 
the 
country 
, 
i 
saw ScrEv_spend_time_train
a 
cow 
or 
two 
. 
after 
about 
a 
half 
hour 
we 
pulled ScrEv_arrive_destination
into 
the 
station 
in 
chicago 
. 
the 
train 
pulled ScrEv_arrive_destination
and 
stopped ScrEv_arrive_destination
rather 
suddenly 
, 
throwing RelNScrEv_train
me 
forward 
a 
bit 
. 
i 
got+up ScrEv_move_exit
and 
went ScrEv_move_exit
down 
the 
aisle 
and 
exited ScrEv_get_off
the 
train 
, 
stepping+down ScrEv_get_off
to 
the 
platform 
and 
exiting RelNScrEv_train
the 
station 
. 
windy 
city 
, 
here 
i 
come UnrelEv_train
! 
<end_of_story>_train 
when 
you 
need 
to 
go UnrelEv_train
outside 
the 
city 
limits 
of 
london 
, 
it 
is UnrelEv_train
best 
to 
take+a+train Evoking_train
. 
cars 
are UnrelEv_train
a 
poor 
choice 
as 
they 
hit UnrelEv_train
traffic 
often 
, 
as 
well 
as 
cost 
money 
to 
drive UnrelEv_train
, 
for 
me 
it 
is UnrelEv_train
far 
cheaper 
to 
take+the+train Evoking_train
. 
this 
, 
of 
course 
, 
was 
when 
i 
lived UnrelEv_train
in 
london 
which 
i 
do UnrelEv_train
not 
do UnrelEv_train
now 
. 
anyway 
, 
when 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_train
to 
visit UnrelEv_train
the 
beach 
town 
of 
brighton 
i 
took+the+train Evoking_train
. 
i 
made+sure UnrelEv_train
to 
research ScrEv_check_time-table
the 
time 
schedule 
as 
to 
find ScrEv_check_time-table
the 
correct 
train 
and 
time 
. 
i 
found ScrEv_check_time-table
there 
was UnrelEv_train
one 
going UnrelEv_train
when 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_train
and 
it 
was 
leaving ScrEv_train_departs
from 
victoria 
station 
. 
i 
made+sure UnrelEv_train
to 
get ScrEv_get_train_station
there 
early 
so 
as 
to 
purchase ScrEv_get_tickets
a 
ticket 
and 
get ScrEv_find_place
a 
good 
seat 
, 
i 
do 
n't 
like UnrelEv_train
traveling Evoking_train
backwards 
. 
having 
bought ScrEv_get_tickets
my 
ticket 
at 
the 
counter 
i 
walked ScrEv_get_platform
to 
the 
waiting RelNScrEv_train
train 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_train
very 
nice 
and 
new 
and 
i 
had UnrelEv_train
little 
trouble 
finding ScrEv_find_place
a 
good 
seat 
. 
i 
settled+in ScrEv_find_place
and 
closed RelNScrEv_train
my 
eyes 
, 
ready 
to 
rest ScrEv_spend_time_train
on 
the 
exceedingly 
comfortable 
train 
that 
was 
taking UnrelEv_train
me 
on 
an 
adventure 
. 
<end_of_story>_train 
last 
weekend 
, 
i 
took+the+train Evoking_train
into 
the 
city 
with 
my 
younger 
brother 
to 
attend UnrelEv_train
a 
concert 
. 
we 
drove ScrEv_get_train_station
to 
the 
train 
station 
to 
catch ScrEv_get_on
the 
523 
pm 
train 
. 
it 
took UnrelEv_train
a 
while 
to 
find+parking RelNScrEv_train
. 
once 
we 
boarded ScrEv_get_on
the 
train 
, 
we 
took ScrEv_find_place
a 
seat 
. 
the 
train 
conductor 
came+by RelNScrEv_train
and 
we 
purchased ScrEv_get_tickets
523 
round 
trip 
tickets 
with 
cash 
. 
the 
ride 
to 
the 
city 
took RelNScrEv_train
about 
an 
hour 
. 
many 
people 
got ScrEv_get_on
on 
and 
off 
at 
every 
stop 
. 
i 
enjoyed UnrelEv_train
the 
people+watching ScrEv_spend_time_train
. 
there 
were UnrelEv_train
many 
different 
types 
of 
people 
, 
the 
business 
types 
, 
students 
, 
families 
, 
and 
coeds 
. 
there 
were UnrelEv_train
a 
couple 
loud 
babies 
and 
annoying UnrelEv_train
blondes 
as 
well 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_train
very 
loud 
. 
after 
about 
an 
hour 
, 
we 
were UnrelEv_train
almost 
to 
our 
stop 
. 
once 
we 
arrived ScrEv_arrive_destination
, 
the 
train 
pulled RelNScrEv_train
into 
the 
system 
and 
the 
conductor 
announced RelNScrEv_train
that 
it 
was UnrelEv_train
the 
last 
stop 
and 
that 
everything 
had 
to 
depart ScrEv_get_off
. 
we 
walked ScrEv_get_off
onto 
the 
platform 
and 
into 
the 
train 
station 
, 
then 
were UnrelEv_train
on 
our 
way 
. 
<end_of_story>_train 
traveling+by+train Evoking_train
is UnrelEv_train
almost 
like 
traveling UnrelEv_train
by 
airplane 
. 
i 
learned UnrelEv_train
that 
the 
train 
companies 
have UnrelEv_train
baggage 
limits 
, 
rules 
for 
unaccompanied UnrelEv_train
minors 
, 
and 
seating ScrEv_find_place
rules 
too 
. 
i 
bought ScrEv_get_tickets
my 
ticket 
ahead 
of 
time 
and 
then 
went ScrEv_get_train_station
to 
my 
station 
. 
they 
checked ScrEv_conductor_checks
my 
ticket 
, 
id 
, 
baggage 
, 
and 
i 
hopped ScrEv_get_on
on 
the 
train 
. 
the 
process 
to 
check RelNScrEv_train
my 
bags 
was UnrelEv_train
so 
similar 
to 
flying UnrelEv_train
. 
i 
packed RelNScrEv_train
a 
small 
bag 
to 
carry RelNScrEv_train
with 
me 
but 
i 
could 
have 
packed RelNScrEv_train
a 
larger 
bag 
that 
would 
be 
checked RelNScrEv_train
. 
no 
sharp 
objects 
, 
self 
defense 
items 
, 
and 
many 
other 
things 
were 
not 
allowed UnrelEv_train
. 
seating ScrEv_find_place
on 
my 
train 
was UnrelEv_train
first 
come 
first 
serve 
basis 
. 
i 
was 
told UnrelEv_train
if 
there 
was UnrelEv_train
any 
concerns 
from 
passengers 
, 
seating ScrEv_find_place
could 
be 
assigned RelNScrEv_train
! 
my 
trip 
was UnrelEv_train
n't 
very 
long 
so 
i 
did 
n't 
have ScrEv_spend_time_train
a 
meal 
but 
i 
brought RelNScrEv_train
some 
snacks 
and 
a 
drink 
with 
me 
. 
before 
i 
knew UnrelEv_train
it 
, 
i 
had 
arrived ScrEv_arrive_destination
at 
my 
destination 
. 
i 
really 
like UnrelEv_train
traveling+by+train Evoking_train
. 
<end_of_story>_train 
last 
week 
i 
traveled+on+a+train Evoking_train
to 
see UnrelEv_train
my 
brother 
. 
when 
my 
brother 
's 
pregnant 
wife 
gave UnrelEv_train
birth 
to 
their 
baby 
i 
was 
excited UnrelEv_train
to 
see UnrelEv_train
them 
and 
their 
new 
addition 
to 
the 
family 
. 
they 
lived UnrelEv_train
523 
miles 
away 
in 
charlotte 
, 
north 
carolina 
. 
the 
cheapest 
option 
was UnrelEv_train
to 
catch+a+train Evoking_train
to 
go+see UnrelEv_train
them 
. 
i 
arrived ScrEv_train_arrives
at 
the 
train 
station 
and 
went RelNScrEv_train
to 
the 
ticket 
desk 
. 
he 
asked RelNScrEv_train
me 
where 
i 
would 
like UnrelEv_train
to 
go RelNScrEv_train
, 
and 
i 
told RelNScrEv_train
him 
where 
and 
why 
. 
he 
was UnrelEv_train
happy 
to 
assist ScrEv_get_tickets
me 
. 
he 
pointed RelNScrEv_train
me 
in 
the 
direction 
to 
the 
correct 
platform 
where 
my 
train 
would 
departure ScrEv_train_departs
from 
. 
when 
i 
got ScrEv_get_platform
to 
the 
platform 
, 
the 
train 
was 
waiting RelNScrEv_train
for 
me 
. 
i 
handed ScrEv_conductor_checks
the 
attendant 
my 
ticket 
and 
got ScrEv_get_on
on 
the 
train 
. 
now 
it 
was UnrelEv_train
time 
to 
put UnrelEv_train
my 
feet 
back 
and 
relax ScrEv_spend_time_train
. 
in 
just 
a 
few 
short 
hours 
, 
i 
arrived ScrEv_arrive_destination
in 
charlotte 
, 
north 
carolina 
and 
was UnrelEv_train
off 
to 
see UnrelEv_train
my 
new 
nephew 
! 
<end_of_story>_train 
last 
summer 
, 
i 
decided UnrelEv_train
i 
wanted UnrelEv_train
to 
visit UnrelEv_train
some 
family 
and 
friends 
of 
mine 
whom 
resided UnrelEv_train
on 
the 
other 
side 
of 
the 
country 
. 
i 
carefully 
considered UnrelEv_train
my 
travel 
options 
and 
expenses 
, 
and 
decided UnrelEv_train
it 
would 
be UnrelEv_train
most 
economical 
to 
take+the+train Evoking_train
. 
traveling+by+train Evoking_train
is UnrelEv_train
an 
easy 
and 
straight 
forward 
experience 
, 
but 
is UnrelEv_train
also 
fun 
and 
enjoyable 
. 
to 
begin UnrelEv_train
, 
i 
visited RelNScrEv_train
the 
railroad 
's 
website 
and 
booked ScrEv_get_tickets
my 
ticket 
. 
the 
ticket 
was 
then 
sent RelNScrEv_train
to 
me 
via 
email 
, 
which 
i 
could 
print+out ScrEv_get_tickets
or 
display ScrEv_conductor_checks
on 
my 
mobile 
device 
. 
on 
the 
day 
of 
travel 
, 
i 
arrived ScrEv_get_train_station
at 
the 
train 
station 
about 
a 
half 
an 
hour 
early 
and 
waited ScrEv_wait
for 
the 
train 
to 
arrive ScrEv_train_arrives
. 
when 
the 
train 
arrived ScrEv_train_arrives
, 
the 
conductor 
stepped+off ScrEv_get_off
and 
asked ScrEv_conductor_checks
for 
tickets 
. 
i 
had 
elected UnrelEv_train
to 
use RelNScrEv_train
my 
mobile 
device 
to 
display ScrEv_conductor_checks
my 
ticket 
, 
so 
i 
showed ScrEv_conductor_checks
the 
ticket 
to 
the 
conductor 
and 
he 
scanned ScrEv_conductor_checks
it 
with 
his 
phone 
. 
i 
was 
then 
directed ScrEv_find_place
towards 
my 
assigned RelNScrEv_train
seat 
. 
i 
settled+in ScrEv_find_place
for 
the 
ride 
, 
with 
food 
and 
entertainment 
i 
had 
brought RelNScrEv_train
with 
me 
. 
for 
most 
of 
the 
ride 
however 
, 
i 
was 
glued ScrEv_spend_time_train
to 
the 
window 
, 
enjoying ScrEv_spend_time_train
the 
sights 
of 
town 
after 
town 
that 
we 
traveled RelNScrEv_train
through 
. 
the 
next 
day 
i 
arrived ScrEv_arrive_destination
at 
my 
destination 
. 
i 
gathered RelNScrEv_train
my 
bags 
and 
stepped+off ScrEv_get_off
the 
train 
, 
knowing UnrelEv_train
i 
would 
return RelNScrEv_train
again 
very 
soon 
. 
<end_of_story>_train 
today 
was UnrelEv_train
the 
big 
day 
, 
i 
was 
going 
to 
visit UnrelEv_train
some 
friends 
in 
florida 
, 
but 
i 
was 
going 
to 
do UnrelEv_train
it 
in 
a 
different 
way 
. 
i 
was 
going 
to 
ride+a+train Evoking_train
today 
for 
the 
first 
time 
ever 
. 
i 
loved UnrelEv_train
trains 
since 
i 
was UnrelEv_train
a 
child 
and 
now 
i 
would 
finally 
get UnrelEv_train
to 
ride+on+one Evoking_train
and 
see ScrEv_spend_time_train
the 
countryside 
. 
i 
bought ScrEv_get_tickets
my 
tickets 
online 
, 
i 
did 
n't 
want UnrelEv_train
to 
make UnrelEv_train
a 
mistake 
and 
got ScrEv_get_train_station
to 
the 
wrong 
station 
. 
i 
had 
my 
bags 
all 
packed RelNScrEv_train
so 
i 
called RelNScrEv_train
for 
a 
cab 
and 
headed ScrEv_get_train_station
to 
the 
train 
station 
. 
once 
there 
i 
took RelNScrEv_train
my 
luggage 
with 
me 
and 
waited ScrEv_wait
for 
my 
train 
to 
pull+up ScrEv_train_arrives
to 
the 
station 
. 
once 
the 
train 
was ScrEv_train_arrives
here 
i 
boarded ScrEv_get_on
and 
found ScrEv_find_place
an 
open 
car 
. 
i 
set RelNScrEv_train
my 
luggage 
in 
the 
overhead 
compartment 
and 
sat ScrEv_find_place
and 
waited ScrEv_wait
my 
ticket 
was 
checked ScrEv_conductor_checks
before 
the 
train 
left ScrEv_train_departs
the 
station 
. 
the 
train 
finally 
pulled+out ScrEv_train_departs
of 
the 
station 
, 
i 
was UnrelEv_train
on 
my 
way 
my 
dream 
was 
being 
realized UnrelEv_train
. 
<end_of_story>_train 
one 
weekend 
, 
my 
partner 
and 
i 
decided UnrelEv_train
to 
take+a+weekday+trip Evoking_train
up 
to 
seattle 
. 
we 
purchased ScrEv_get_tickets
tickets 
online 
immediately 
after 
a 
quick 
breakfast 
. 
after 
deciding UnrelEv_train
what 
parts 
of 
seattle 
to 
visit UnrelEv_train
, 
we 
drove+over ScrEv_get_train_station
to 
amtrak 
station 
and 
parked RelNScrEv_train
in 
a 
spot 
allowed UnrelEv_train
for 
the 
day 
. 
the 
boarding ScrEv_get_on
process 
was UnrelEv_train
very 
simple 
, 
the 
train 
was UnrelEv_train
also 
a 
lot 
cleaner 
than 
we 
thought UnrelEv_train
! 
we 
had ScrEv_spend_time_train
grilled UnrelEv_train
cheese 
sandwiches 
from 
a 
menu 
handed RelNScrEv_train
to 
us 
, 
they 
were UnrelEv_train
delicious 
. 
it 
took RelNScrEv_train
barely 
a 
few 
hours 
to 
get ScrEv_arrive_destination
there 
, 
so 
we 
decided UnrelEv_train
to 
look+out ScrEv_spend_time_train
the 
window 
at 
the 
scenery 
most 
of 
the 
time 
. 
none 
of 
us 
became RelNScrEv_train
sick 
, 
which 
was UnrelEv_train
another 
one 
of 
our 
worries 
. 
my 
partner 
suffers UnrelEv_train
from 
light 
vertigo 
. 
the 
staff 
on 
the 
train 
were UnrelEv_train
exceptionally 
nice 
, 
and 
offered ScrEv_spend_time_train
us 
snacks 
on 
occasion 
. 
the 
train 
was UnrelEv_train
a 
great 
idea 
for 
the 
trip 
we 
had 
planned UnrelEv_train
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_train
much 
nicer 
than 
driving+up UnrelEv_train
the 
interstate 
. 
<end_of_story>_train 
a 
few 
months 
ago 
, 
i 
took+a+train Evoking_train
to 
sacramento 
to 
visit UnrelEv_train
my 
friend 
and 
her 
family 
. 
i 
had 
decided UnrelEv_train
to 
take+the+train Evoking_train
because 
sacramento 
is UnrelEv_train
523 
miles 
from 
the 
city 
i 
live UnrelEv_train
in 
and 
i 
am UnrelEv_train
not 
a 
good 
driver 
. 
i 
ordered ScrEv_get_tickets
the 
train 
tickets 
online 
a 
week 
before 
my 
trip 
and 
wrote+down ScrEv_other_train
my 
confirmation 
number 
. 
when 
i 
got ScrEv_other_train
to 
the 
train 
station 
, 
i 
went UnrelEv_train
to 
a 
small 
self-service 
kiosk 
in 
the 
lobby 
and 
entered ScrEv_other_train
my 
personal 
information 
including 
my 
confirmation 
number 
, 
and 
printed ScrEv_get_tickets
out 
my 
train 
ticket 
. 
after 
that 
, 
i 
walked+up ScrEv_get_platform
to 
the 
platform 
and 
waited ScrEv_wait
for 
my 
train 
. 
there 
were UnrelEv_train
several 
electronic 
displays 
that 
said UnrelEv_train
when 
the 
train 
would 
come RelNScrEv_train
, 
and 
i 
watched RelNScrEv_train
them 
impatiently 
. 
when 
the 
train 
arrived ScrEv_train_arrives
, 
i 
boarded ScrEv_get_on
behind 
another 
passenger 
and 
found ScrEv_find_place
a 
window 
seat 
so 
i 
could 
enjoy ScrEv_spend_time_train
the 
view 
. 
i 
also 
liked UnrelEv_train
the 
seat 
because 
it 
had UnrelEv_train
a 
table 
in 
front 
of 
it 
. 
i 
had UnrelEv_train
a 
backpack 
with 
me 
which 
i 
put ScrEv_other_train
in 
the 
compartment 
above 
my 
seat 
. 
i 
put UnrelEv_train
my 
ticket 
on 
top 
of 
the 
table 
so 
it 
would 
be UnrelEv_train
easy 
to 
find UnrelEv_train
. 
a 
few 
minutes 
later 
, 
a 
worker 
came+by ScrEv_conductor_checks
to 
check ScrEv_conductor_checks
passenger 
's 
tickets 
, 
and 
after 
i 
showed RelNScrEv_train
him 
and 
he 
stamped RelNScrEv_train
it 
, 
i 
put UnrelEv_train
my 
ticket 
in 
my 
pocket 
. 
there 
were UnrelEv_train
not 
many 
people 
traveling UnrelEv_train
so 
no 
one 
sat UnrelEv_train
near 
me 
. 
the 
train 
departed ScrEv_train_departs
the 
station 
shortly 
after 
that 
. 
i 
fell+asleep ScrEv_spend_time_train
on 
the 
train 
, 
but 
i 
woke+up ScrEv_spend_time_train
well 
before 
my 
stop 
. 
when 
the 
train 
stopped ScrEv_arrive_destination
at 
my 
station 
, 
i 
grabbed ScrEv_other_train
my 
backpack 
and 
off+boarded ScrEv_get_off
onto 
the 
platform 
. 
then 
i 
went RelNScrEv_train
in 
to 
the 
train 
station 
and 
met UnrelEv_train
my 
friend 
who 
had 
come 
to 
pick UnrelEv_train
me 
up 
. 
<end_of_story>_train 
as 
i 
hung UnrelEv_train
the 
phone 
with 
my 
friend 
, 
i 
was UnrelEv_train
very 
excited 
. 
i 
was 
going 
to 
visit UnrelEv_train
her 
today 
, 
and 
i 
would 
get UnrelEv_train
to 
travel+by+train Evoking_train
. 
i 
called UnrelEv_train
for 
a 
taxi 
, 
then 
quickly 
packed+up UnrelEv_train
a 
day 
bag 
with 
a 
few 
things 
i 
would 
need UnrelEv_train
. 
as 
the 
taxi 
took ScrEv_get_train_station
me 
to 
the 
train 
station 
, 
i 
realized UnrelEv_train
i 
had 
not+traveled+by+train Evoking_train
in 
many 
years 
, 
and 
wondered UnrelEv_train
what 
might 
have 
changed UnrelEv_train
. 
as 
soon 
as 
i 
arrived ScrEv_get_train_station
, 
it 
was UnrelEv_train
obvious 
. 
now 
you 
didnt 
have 
to 
wait RelNScrEv_train
in 
line 
to 
buy RelNScrEv_train
tickets 
from 
a 
person 
, 
but 
instead 
from 
a 
machine 
. 
i 
found UnrelEv_train
one 
that 
was 
unused UnrelEv_train
, 
and 
stepped+up UnrelEv_train
to 
read UnrelEv_train
the 
directions 
. 
i 
thought UnrelEv_train
this 
was UnrelEv_train
very 
confusing 
, 
until 
a 
station 
employee 
stopped UnrelEv_train
and 
explained RelNScrEv_train
the 
process 
to 
me 
. 
soon 
i 
had ScrEv_get_tickets
my 
ticket 
, 
and 
was 
walking ScrEv_get_platform
to 
line 
where 
i 
would 
await ScrEv_wait
the 
train 
's 
arrival 
. 
if 
was UnrelEv_train
not 
far 
, 
and 
there 
was UnrelEv_train
even 
an 
empty 
bench 
seat 
. 
soon 
the 
train 
arrived ScrEv_train_arrives
and 
i 
stepped ScrEv_other_train
up 
into 
the 
car 
printed UnrelEv_train
on 
my 
ticket 
, 
and 
found ScrEv_find_place
my 
seat 
. 
after 
the 
train 
was ScrEv_train_departs
in 
motion 
, 
a 
conductor 
came+by ScrEv_conductor_checks
to 
check ScrEv_conductor_checks
and 
punch ScrEv_conductor_checks
my 
ticket 
. 
he 
smiled UnrelEv_train
, 
and 
told RelNScrEv_train
me 
to 
have UnrelEv_train
a 
good 
trip 
. 
<end_of_story>_train 
today 
i 
am 
going 
to 
ride+a+train Evoking_train
to 
visit UnrelEv_train
my 
grandmother 
. 
we 
are 
going 
to 
visit UnrelEv_train
for 
my 
birthday 
. 
we 
left UnrelEv_train
our 
home 
and 
drove ScrEv_get_train_station
in 
our 
car 
to 
the 
train 
station 
. 
we 
then 
went+up UnrelEv_train
to 
the 
counter 
and 
bought ScrEv_get_tickets
two 
tickets 
to 
ride+the+train Evoking_train
to 
my 
grandmother 
's 
town 
. 
we 
had 
to 
wait ScrEv_wait
for 
twenty 
minutes 
in 
the 
station 
before 
it 
was UnrelEv_train
time 
to 
board ScrEv_get_on
our 
train 
. 
when 
it 
was UnrelEv_train
time 
, 
we 
went+over UnrelEv_train
to 
the 
train 
and 
handed RelNScrEv_train
our 
tickets 
to 
a 
man 
in 
a 
uniform 
that 
works UnrelEv_train
on 
the 
train 
. 
he 
checked ScrEv_conductor_checks
our 
tickets 
and 
helped RelNScrEv_train
us 
up 
onto 
the 
train 
. 
we 
then 
found ScrEv_find_place
a 
seat 
and 
enjoyed UnrelEv_train
the 
ride 
. 
we 
saw UnrelEv_train
many 
interesting 
things 
on 
our 
way 
to 
see UnrelEv_train
my 
grandmother 
. 
the 
train 
moved RelNScrEv_train
very 
fast 
along 
the 
tracks 
. 
we 
arrived ScrEv_arrive_destination
at 
our 
destination 
quickly 
. 
when 
the 
train 
pulled+into RelNScrEv_train
the 
station 
, 
we 
saw UnrelEv_train
my 
grandmother 
waiting RelNScrEv_train
there 
for 
us 
! 
<end_of_story>_train 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_train
to 
visit UnrelEv_train
my 
friend 
in 
the 
city 
, 
but 
i 
did 
n't 
have UnrelEv_train
a 
car 
. 
so 
, 
i 
decided UnrelEv_train
to 
take+the+train Evoking_train
. 
i 
walked ScrEv_get_train_station
to 
the 
train 
station 
and 
went+up UnrelEv_train
to 
the 
ticket 
counter 
. 
i 
asked RelNScrEv_train
for 
a 
ticket 
to 
the 
city 
where 
my 
friend 
lived UnrelEv_train
and 
asked RelNScrEv_train
for 
the 
one 
that 
would 
depart RelNScrEv_train
the 
soonest 
. 
the 
ticket 
person 
sold ScrEv_get_tickets
me 
a 
ticket 
and 
i 
paid RelNScrEv_train
for 
it 
in 
cash 
. 
i 
called UnrelEv_train
my 
friend 
and 
told UnrelEv_train
them 
when 
i 
would 
be 
arriving RelNScrEv_train
to 
the 
train 
station 
near 
them 
. 
i 
waited ScrEv_wait
by 
the 
train 
terminal 
for 
my 
train 
. 
when 
the 
train 
arrived ScrEv_arrive_destination
i 
boarded ScrEv_get_on
the 
train 
and 
took ScrEv_find_place
a 
seat 
. 
the 
train 
passed RelNScrEv_train
many 
stops 
and 
finally 
i 
reached ScrEv_arrive_destination
the 
stop 
that 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_train
. 
i 
got+off ScrEv_get_off
the 
train 
and 
saw UnrelEv_train
my 
friend 
waiting RelNScrEv_train
for 
me 
to 
pick RelNScrEv_train
me 
up 
. 
the 
train 
had 
arrived ScrEv_arrive_destination
at 
exactly 
the 
time 
that 
was 
stated UnrelEv_train
on 
the 
ticket 
. 
<end_of_story>_train 
on 
the 
weekend 
i 
caught+the+train Evoking_train
into 
the 
city 
. 
before 
i 
left UnrelEv_train
my 
house 
in 
the 
morning 
, 
i 
checked RelNScrEv_train
the 
train 
timetable 
online 
. 
i 
then 
walked ScrEv_get_train_station
to 
the 
train 
station 
. 
at 
the 
train 
station 
, 
i 
went UnrelEv_train
to 
the 
ticket 
booth 
and 
asked RelNScrEv_train
for 
one 
return 
ticket 
to 
where 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_train
to 
go UnrelEv_train
. 
i 
paid RelNScrEv_train
the 
man 
at 
the 
booth 
and 
he 
gave ScrEv_get_tickets
me 
my 
ticket 
. 
i 
then 
sat+down UnrelEv_train
on 
a 
bench 
on 
the 
train 
platform 
and 
waited ScrEv_wait
for 
my 
train 
to 
arrive ScrEv_arrive_destination
. 
five 
minutes 
later 
, 
the 
train 
arrived ScrEv_arrive_destination
. 
i 
stood UnrelEv_train
up 
and 
got+on ScrEv_get_on
the 
train 
. 
on 
the 
train 
, 
i 
found ScrEv_find_place
an 
empty 
seat 
and 
sat+down UnrelEv_train
. 
i 
pulled UnrelEv_train
a 
book 
out 
of 
my 
bag 
and 
read ScrEv_spend_time_train
it 
while 
i 
waited ScrEv_wait
for 
the 
train 
to 
arrive ScrEv_arrive_destination
at 
my 
stop 
. 
when 
the 
train 
conductor 
announced RelNScrEv_train
that 
the 
train 
had 
reached ScrEv_arrive_destination
my 
stop 
, 
i 
stood+up ScrEv_move_exit
and 
exited ScrEv_get_off
the 
train 
. 
<end_of_story>_train 
i 
needed 
to 
visit UnrelEv_train
my 
grandma 
upstate 
, 
so 
i 
decided UnrelEv_train
to 
take+a+train Evoking_train
. 
i 
purchased ScrEv_get_tickets
my 
tickets 
online 
and 
printed RelNScrEv_train
out 
a 
receipt 
. 
i 
packed UnrelEv_train
a 
bag 
. 
the 
next 
day 
, 
i 
headed ScrEv_get_train_station
over 
to 
the 
train 
station 
and 
checked+in ScrEv_other_train
at 
the 
ticket 
counter 
. 
i 
was 
early 
, 
so 
i 
picked UnrelEv_train
a 
spot 
on 
a 
bench 
and 
sat+down UnrelEv_train
. 
after 
a 
short 
while 
, 
everybody 
lined+up RelNScrEv_train
to 
get+on RelNScrEv_train
the 
train 
. 
a 
train 
worker 
checked ScrEv_conductor_checks
all 
of 
our 
tickets 
. 
i 
entered ScrEv_get_on
the 
train 
and 
picked+out ScrEv_find_place
a 
seat 
for 
myself 
. 
then 
i 
loaded RelNScrEv_train
my 
bag 
overhead 
. 
once 
everyone 
was UnrelEv_train
on 
the 
train 
, 
our 
conductor 
announced RelNScrEv_train
that 
we 
were 
leaving ScrEv_train_departs
the 
station 
. 
another 
train 
worker 
came+around ScrEv_conductor_checks
and 
took ScrEv_conductor_checks
everyone 
's 
tickets 
from 
them 
. 
i 
spent ScrEv_spend_time_train
the 
ride 
looking ScrEv_spend_time_train
at 
scenery 
out 
the 
window 
and 
reading ScrEv_spend_time_train
mostly 
. 
eventually 
, 
the 
train 
conductor 
announced ScrEv_other_train
my 
stop 
. 
i 
retrieved RelNScrEv_train
my 
bag 
from 
the 
overhead 
compartment 
, 
and 
headed ScrEv_move_exit
downstairs 
and 
off 
of 
the 
train 
. 
<end_of_story>_train 
i 
needed 
to 
travel UnrelEv_train
across 
the 
state 
, 
and 
the+train+was+the+quickest+and+most+efficient+way Evoking_train
to 
do+that UnrelEv_train
as 
my 
car 
is UnrelEv_train
unable 
to 
make UnrelEv_train
a 
long 
trip 
. 
i 
went+online UnrelEv_train
to 
the 
amtrak 
website 
and 
checked ScrEv_other_train
the 
schedule 
and 
prices 
, 
and 
then 
made ScrEv_other_train
a 
reservation 
. 
a 
friend 
gave ScrEv_get_train_station
me 
a 
lift 
to 
the 
depot 
and 
once 
there 
i 
purchased ScrEv_get_tickets
my 
ticket 
and 
then 
boarded ScrEv_get_on
the 
train 
when 
it 
arrived ScrEv_train_arrives
on 
time 
. 
i 
brought UnrelEv_train
my 
small 
suitcase 
onboard 
with 
me 
and 
did 
not 
need 
to 
check UnrelEv_train
any 
other 
bags 
. 
the 
train 
ride 
was UnrelEv_train
comfortable 
and 
not 
crowded 
, 
so 
i 
had UnrelEv_train
my 
own 
seat 
. 
there 
were UnrelEv_train
no 
delays 
on 
the 
tracks 
and 
my 
carriage 
had UnrelEv_train
only 
mature 
adults 
who 
were UnrelEv_train
peaceful 
and 
quiet 
, 
so 
it 
was UnrelEv_train
a 
pleasant 
and 
quiet 
journey 
. 
i 
visited ScrEv_spend_time_train
the 
dining 
car 
to 
get ScrEv_spend_time_train
a 
snack 
and 
though 
it 
was UnrelEv_train
expensive 
it 
was UnrelEv_train
well 
stocked 
, 
and 
i 
bought UnrelEv_train
a 
coffee 
and 
a 
turkey 
sandwich 
. 
my 
arrival 
was UnrelEv_train
on 
time 
and 
i 
disembarked ScrEv_get_off
. 
<end_of_story>_train 
last 
month 
i 
visited UnrelEv_train
my 
relatives 
who 
live UnrelEv_train
523 
miles 
away 
. 
i 
did 
n't 
want UnrelEv_train
to 
drive UnrelEv_train
all 
the 
way 
there 
myself 
, 
so 
i 
decided UnrelEv_train
one 
of 
the 
best 
methods 
for 
me 
to 
get UnrelEv_train
there 
would 
be 
to 
take+a+train Evoking_train
. 
since 
i 
have 
n't 
traveled+on+a+train Evoking_train
before 
i 
did 
n't 
know UnrelEv_train
where 
i 
should 
begin UnrelEv_train
. 
i 
decided UnrelEv_train
to 
look+online RelNScrEv_train
for 
instructions 
on 
what 
to 
do UnrelEv_train
. 
luckily 
i 
was UnrelEv_train
able 
to 
find RelNScrEv_train
all 
the 
necessary 
information 
to 
make UnrelEv_train
my 
trip 
possible 
. 
the 
next 
day 
i 
drove+over ScrEv_get_train_station
to 
the 
train 
station 
and 
parked UnrelEv_train
in 
the 
secured 
parking 
lot 
. 
i 
went+over UnrelEv_train
to 
the 
ticket 
booth 
and 
paid RelNScrEv_train
for 
a 
ticket 
, 
it 
cost RelNScrEv_train
me 
around 
$ 
523 
. 
i 
then 
waited ScrEv_wait
for 
the 
train 
to 
arrive ScrEv_train_arrives
. 
once 
it 
did ScrEv_train_arrives
i 
got ScrEv_get_on
on 
board 
and 
stored ScrEv_other_train
my 
belongings 
in 
the 
luggage 
compartment 
. 
i 
then 
took ScrEv_find_place
a 
seat 
and 
relaxed ScrEv_spend_time_train
. 
the 
train 
started+up ScrEv_train_departs
, 
and 
after 
a 
couple 
of 
hours 
i 
reached ScrEv_arrive_destination
my 
destination 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_train
an 
interesting 
and 
fun 
experience 
. 
<end_of_story>_train 
i 
walked+into+the+train+station Evoking_train
, 
stood ScrEv_other_train
in 
line 
, 
and 
purchased ScrEv_get_tickets
a 
round 
trip 
ticket 
to 
chicago 
. 
i 
placed UnrelEv_train
my 
ticket 
in 
my 
pocket 
and 
then 
walked ScrEv_get_platform
outside 
to 
wait ScrEv_wait
for 
the 
train 
. 
i 
stood UnrelEv_train
next 
to 
many 
other 
people 
that 
were 
also 
waiting ScrEv_wait
for 
the 
train 
. 
we 
heard UnrelEv_train
the 
train 
coming ScrEv_train_arrives
when 
it 
was UnrelEv_train
still 
a 
long 
distance 
away 
. 
it 
finally 
pulled ScrEv_train_arrives
up 
to 
the 
tracks 
. 
everyone 
lined+up RelNScrEv_train
to 
get+inside RelNScrEv_train
the 
doors 
. 
the 
doors 
open ScrEv_door_opens
and 
we 
all 
filed ScrEv_get_on
in 
. 
i 
found ScrEv_find_place
a 
seat 
by 
myself 
at 
the 
back 
of 
the 
train 
. 
i 
sat+down UnrelEv_train
and 
looked+out ScrEv_spend_time_train
the 
window 
at 
the 
passing UnrelEv_train
towns 
. 
after 
awhile 
, 
the 
announcer 
said RelNScrEv_train
the 
next 
and 
final 
stop 
would 
be UnrelEv_train
chicago 
. 
i 
stood+up ScrEv_move_exit
and 
walked+over ScrEv_move_exit
to 
the 
doors 
. 
the 
train 
pulled ScrEv_arrive_destination
into 
the 
station 
, 
making UnrelEv_train
a 
loud 
screeching 
noise 
. 
it 
slowly 
came RelNScrEv_train
to 
a 
stop 
inside 
the 
station 
. 
the 
doors 
opened ScrEv_door_opens
and 
all 
the 
passengers 
climbed ScrEv_get_off
off 
the 
train 
, 
and 
into 
union 
station 
in 
chicago 
. 
<end_of_story>_train 
yesterday 
, 
i 
decided UnrelEv_train
to 
visit UnrelEv_train
my 
sister 
who 
lives UnrelEv_train
a 
few 
towns 
away 
. 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_train
to 
take+the+train Evoking_train
because 
it 
is UnrelEv_train
cheaper 
than 
putting UnrelEv_train
gas 
in 
my 
car 
. 
so 
i 
drove ScrEv_get_train_station
to 
the 
train 
station 
and 
parked UnrelEv_train
my 
car 
in 
the 
parking 
lot 
. 
i 
walked UnrelEv_train
to 
the 
cashier 
's 
window 
and 
waited ScrEv_wait
in 
line 
. 
once 
i 
reached UnrelEv_train
the 
front 
of 
the 
line 
, 
i 
greeted UnrelEv_train
the 
cashier 
and 
bought ScrEv_get_tickets
a 
train 
ticket 
. 
i 
walked ScrEv_get_platform
to 
the 
train 
platform 
and 
waited ScrEv_wait
for 
the 
train 
to 
arrive RelNScrEv_train
. 
when 
the 
train 
finally 
arrived ScrEv_train_arrives
, 
i 
got+on ScrEv_get_on
the 
train 
and 
located ScrEv_find_place
my 
seat 
, 
which 
was 
printed UnrelEv_train
on 
my 
ticket 
. 
i 
sat UnrelEv_train
in 
my 
seat 
and 
took+out ScrEv_spend_time_train
the 
magazine 
that 
i 
had 
brought UnrelEv_train
to 
read ScrEv_spend_time_train
on 
the 
ride 
. 
the 
train 
eventually 
started ScrEv_train_departs
back 
up 
and 
left ScrEv_train_departs
the 
station 
. 
before 
long 
, 
a 
ticket 
taker 
came+over ScrEv_conductor_checks
and 
asked ScrEv_conductor_checks
for 
my 
ticket 
to 
verify UnrelEv_train
that 
i 
had 
paid RelNScrEv_train
for 
my 
ride 
and 
was UnrelEv_train
in 
the 
correct 
seat 
. 
i 
greeted RelNScrEv_train
the 
ticket 
taker 
and 
gave ScrEv_other_train
him 
my 
ticket 
. 
when 
i 
arrived ScrEv_arrive_destination
at 
my 
sister 
's 
city 
, 
i 
got+off ScrEv_get_off
the 
train 
and 
she 
was UnrelEv_train
there 
to 
meet UnrelEv_train
me 
at 
the 
station 
. 
we 
had UnrelEv_train
a 
very 
nice 
visit 
. 
<end_of_story>_train 
last 
night 
i 
had UnrelEv_train
a 
meeting 
in 
the 
city 
. 
i 
live UnrelEv_train
about 
an 
hour 
train+ride Evoking_train
from 
the 
city 
. 
i 
got UnrelEv_train
ready 
in 
my 
house 
and 
walked+out UnrelEv_train
of 
my 
house 
leaving UnrelEv_train
plenty 
of 
time 
to 
get UnrelEv_train
to 
my 
meeting 
on 
time 
. 
i 
had 
to 
refill RelNScrEv_train
my 
metrocard 
with 
more 
money 
for 
the 
train 
fare 
. 
they 
have 
raised UnrelEv_train
the 
train 
fares 
again 
. 
i 
enter ScrEv_get_train_station
the 
train 
station 
, 
payed ScrEv_get_tickets
for 
my 
metrocard 
at 
a 
machine 
, 
and 
walked+down ScrEv_get_platform
the 
stairs 
to 
wait+for ScrEv_wait
my 
train 
. 
i 
need 
to 
take+two+trains Evoking_train
so 
i 
will 
switch ScrEv_other_train
for 
another 
train 
at 
another 
stop 
. 
my 
train 
arrives ScrEv_train_arrives
quickly 
and 
i 
manage UnrelEv_train
to 
get ScrEv_find_place
a 
seat 
because 
it 
was UnrelEv_train
n't 
too 
busy 
. 
after 
getting+off ScrEv_get_off
the 
first 
train 
and 
switching ScrEv_other_train
for 
another 
train 
523 
minutes 
later 
, 
i 
arrived ScrEv_arrive_destination
at 
the 
destination 
and 
was UnrelEv_train
on 
time 
for 
the 
meeting 
. 
now 
i 
have 
to 
repeat UnrelEv_train
the 
commute 
home 
after 
the 
meeting 
and 
hope UnrelEv_train
it 
will 
be UnrelEv_train
as 
smooth 
. 
<end_of_story>_train 
my 
friend 
and 
i 
set+aside UnrelEv_train
a 
date 
that 
we 
could 
meet UnrelEv_train
each 
other 
. 
she 
lives UnrelEv_train
in 
another 
area 
so 
i 
had 
to 
buy ScrEv_get_tickets
a 
train 
ticket 
. 
since 
we 
planned UnrelEv_train
the 
trip 
early 
, 
i 
was 
able 
to 
save UnrelEv_train
a 
little 
bit 
of 
money 
. 
the 
trip 
would 
n't 
be UnrelEv_train
for 
another 
two 
weeks 
. 
i 
bought ScrEv_get_tickets
the 
tickets 
online 
. 
once 
the 
day 
finally 
came UnrelEv_train
, 
i 
took ScrEv_get_train_station
a 
cab 
to 
the 
train 
station 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_train
n't 
very 
far 
. 
once 
, 
inside 
the 
station 
, 
i 
checked ScrEv_check_time-table
the 
displays 
for 
any 
signs 
of 
my 
train 
being UnrelEv_train
late 
. 
today 
, 
there 
were UnrelEv_train
n't 
any 
. 
about 
fifteen 
minutes 
later 
, 
my 
train 
showed+up ScrEv_train_arrives
and 
i 
got ScrEv_get_on
on 
board 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_train
crowded 
but 
not 
as 
much 
as 
one 
of 
the 
local 
trains 
. 
i 
made+sure UnrelEv_train
to 
listen RelNScrEv_train
for 
any 
announcements 
about 
what 
stops 
we 
were 
arriving RelNScrEv_train
at 
so 
i 
'd 
know 
when 
i 
was UnrelEv_train
close 
to 
my 
destination 
. 
finally 
, 
the 
train 
arrived ScrEv_train_arrives
at 
my 
destination 
and 
i 
met UnrelEv_train
my 
friend 
just 
outside 
the 
station 
. 
<end_of_story>_train 
last 
year 
i 
had 
to 
go UnrelEv_train
to 
my 
native 
place 
in 
india 
. 
while 
i 
was UnrelEv_train
there 
, 
i 
thought UnrelEv_train
of 
meeting UnrelEv_train
one 
of 
my 
friends 
in 
chennai 
. 
chennai 
is UnrelEv_train
523 
kms 
far 
away 
from 
my 
place 
and 
it 
takes UnrelEv_train
about 
523 
hours 
if 
i 
drive UnrelEv_train
. 
i 
decided UnrelEv_train
to 
take+train Evoking_train
. 
i 
went UnrelEv_train
online 
and 
booked ScrEv_get_tickets
tickets 
. 
the 
economy 
tickets 
were 
sold+out RelNScrEv_train
so 
i 
had 
to 
book ScrEv_get_tickets
the 
expensive 
one 
. 
on 
the 
day 
of 
the 
travel 
, 
i 
arrived ScrEv_get_train_station
at 
the 
train 
station 
almost 
an 
hour 
before 
the 
actual 
departure 
time 
. 
since 
it 
was UnrelEv_train
a 
first 
class 
ticket 
, 
i 
could 
take RelNScrEv_train
more 
than 
enough 
luggage 
with 
me 
. 
after 
523 
minutes 
in 
to 
the 
journey 
, 
the 
ticket 
collector 
came+by UnrelEv_train
and 
checked ScrEv_conductor_checks
my 
tickets 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_train
early 
in 
the 
morning 
and 
i 
was UnrelEv_train
in 
a 
window 
seat 
. 
so 
i 
could 
watch ScrEv_spend_time_train
all 
the 
scenery 
. 
another 
good 
thing 
about 
the 
train 
is UnrelEv_train
that 
once 
in 
a 
while 
i 
could 
get+up ScrEv_spend_time_train
and 
walk ScrEv_spend_time_train
a 
stretch 
. 
also 
, 
when 
i 
'm UnrelEv_train
hungry 
, 
i 
could 
get+down RelNScrEv_train
at 
the 
station 
and 
buy UnrelEv_train
any 
food 
as 
the 
train 
stops RelNScrEv_train
at 
the 
station 
for 
10-15 
minutes 
. 
overall 
it 
was UnrelEv_train
a 
wonderful 
experience 
. 
<end_of_story>_train 
yesterday 
i 
traveled UnrelEv_train
from 
london 
in 
the 
united 
kingdom 
to 
my 
home 
in 
manchester 
. 
i 
visited RelNScrEv_train
a 
website 
for 
train 
times 
and 
tickets 
the 
day 
before 
. 
i 
knew UnrelEv_train
when 
i 
needed 
to 
arrive UnrelEv_train
in 
manchester 
so 
i 
searched RelNScrEv_train
using 
my 
desired 
arrival 
time 
. 
i 
selected ScrEv_get_tickets
a 
ticket 
that 
worked UnrelEv_train
for 
me 
and 
had UnrelEv_train
the 
lowest 
price 
. 
i 
used UnrelEv_train
my 
debit 
card 
to 
pay RelNScrEv_train
and 
selected UnrelEv_train
the 
option 
to 
collect UnrelEv_train
the 
ticket 
at 
the 
train 
station 
. 
i 
arrived ScrEv_get_train_station
at 
the 
train 
station 
in 
plenty 
of 
time 
because 
i 
know UnrelEv_train
there 
can 
be UnrelEv_train
long 
queues 
at 
the 
machines 
where 
tickets 
are 
collected UnrelEv_train
. 
when 
it 
was UnrelEv_train
my 
turn 
at 
the 
ticket 
machine 
, 
i 
followed UnrelEv_train
the 
instructions 
and 
input RelNScrEv_train
my 
ticket 
reference 
number 
, 
which 
i 
had 
stored UnrelEv_train
on 
my 
smartphone 
. 
the 
machine 
printed+out UnrelEv_train
my 
tickets 
and 
i 
picked ScrEv_get_tickets
them 
up 
, 
checking RelNScrEv_train
them 
to 
make+sure UnrelEv_train
they 
were 
correct 
. 
next 
i 
needed 
to 
determine UnrelEv_train
which 
platform 
my 
train 
would 
be 
departing RelNScrEv_train
from 
. 
i 
walked+over UnrelEv_train
to 
the 
large 
electronic 
display 
boards 
. 
lots 
of 
destinations 
were 
listed UnrelEv_train
and 
i 
had 
to 
wait ScrEv_wait
a 
little 
while 
before 
manchester 
showed+up UnrelEv_train
. 
there 
was UnrelEv_train
more 
than 
one 
train 
to 
manchester 
, 
so 
i 
confirmed UnrelEv_train
which 
one 
was UnrelEv_train
mine 
by 
the 
train 
company 
and 
the 
departure 
time 
. 
it 
said UnrelEv_train
it 
would 
leave RelNScrEv_train
from 
platform 
523 
so 
i 
followed ScrEv_get_platform
the 
signs 
to 
the 
platform 
. 
once 
at 
the 
platform 
i 
sat UnrelEv_train
and 
waited ScrEv_wait
until 
my 
train 
arrived ScrEv_train_arrives
. 
after 
all 
of 
the 
arriving ScrEv_train_arrives
people 
got+off ScrEv_get_off
, 
i 
boarded ScrEv_get_on
the 
car 
indicated UnrelEv_train
on 
my 
ticket 
and 
took ScrEv_find_place
my 
reserved 
seat 
, 
ready 
for 
the 
journey 
. 
<end_of_story>_train 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_train
to 
go UnrelEv_train
on 
a 
trip 
into 
the 
city 
to 
go UnrelEv_train
clothes 
shopping 
. 
so 
i 
got UnrelEv_train
into 
my 
car 
and 
drove UnrelEv_train
to 
the 
local 
commuter 
train 
station 
in 
my 
town 
. 
when 
i 
got ScrEv_get_train_station
to 
the 
train 
station 
, 
i 
paid ScrEv_get_tickets
my 
ten 
dollar 
fare 
, 
and 
hopped+on ScrEv_get_on
the 
train 
. 
as 
i 
got+on ScrEv_get_on
the 
train 
, 
there 
were UnrelEv_train
two 
different 
levels 
, 
a 
top 
and 
bottom 
level 
. 
i 
climbed ScrEv_other_train
the 
stairs 
to 
get 
to 
the 
top 
level 
, 
and 
proceeded UnrelEv_train
to 
walk+down UnrelEv_train
the 
aisle 
to 
find ScrEv_find_place
a 
decent 
seat 
, 
preferably 
by 
the 
window 
. 
as 
i 
sat+down UnrelEv_train
, 
i 
looked+at ScrEv_spend_time_train
the 
window 
with 
curiosity 
as 
the 
train 
started 
whizzing+by UnrelEv_train
our 
surroundings 
. 
we 
made ScrEv_other_train
plenty 
of 
stops 
, 
and 
each 
time 
plenty 
of 
fresh 
new 
faces 
came+abroad UnrelEv_train
, 
awaiting UnrelEv_train
to 
get+to UnrelEv_train
their 
destination 
. 
on 
the 
train 
i 
made ScrEv_spend_time_train
a 
few 
new 
friends 
, 
and 
the 
trip 
into 
the 
city 
was UnrelEv_train
very 
fun 
indeed 
. 
<end_of_story>_train 
a 
few 
years 
ago 
i 
rode+the+train Evoking_train
from 
arizona 
to 
washington 
state 
. 
it 
took UnrelEv_train
a 
long 
time 
. 
i 
purchased ScrEv_get_tickets
my 
ticket 
online 
. 
when 
it 
came UnrelEv_train
time 
to 
board RelNScrEv_train
the 
train 
i 
got UnrelEv_train
a 
ride 
from 
a 
friend 
, 
who 
dropped ScrEv_get_train_station
me 
off 
right 
next 
to 
the 
tracks 
. 
i 
showed RelNScrEv_train
my 
ticket 
to 
the 
train 
attendant 
, 
and 
he 
let UnrelEv_train
me 
aboard 
the 
train 
. 
there 
was UnrelEv_train
another 
person 
on 
the 
train 
who 
showed RelNScrEv_train
me 
what 
seat 
to 
sit UnrelEv_train
in 
. 
after 
everyone 
had 
boarded RelNScrEv_train
, 
the 
train 
got 
moving ScrEv_train_departs
. 
the 
trip 
from 
arizona 
to 
washington 
takes UnrelEv_train
a 
week 
, 
with 
a 
lot 
of 
stops 
in 
between 
. 
the 
serve RelNScrEv_train
food 
right 
on 
the 
train 
, 
but 
it 
also 
stops ScrEv_other_train
in 
a 
lot 
of 
towns 
where 
you 
can 
get+off ScrEv_get_off
and 
eat UnrelEv_train
or 
buy UnrelEv_train
souvenirs 
. 
not 
much 
happens UnrelEv_train
while 
you 
are UnrelEv_train
on 
the 
train 
, 
but 
there 
is 
a 
lot 
to 
look+out ScrEv_spend_time_train
and 
see UnrelEv_train
from 
the 
windows 
. 
when 
we 
finally 
reached ScrEv_arrive_destination
washington 
the 
train 
conductor 
made ScrEv_other_train
an 
announcement 
over 
the 
intercom 
, 
and 
i 
got+off ScrEv_get_off
at 
my 
stop 
, 
then 
went UnrelEv_train
home 
to 
my 
family 
. 
<end_of_story>_train 
last 
night 
we 
decided UnrelEv_train
to 
head UnrelEv_train
into 
new 
york 
city 
. 
driving+in UnrelEv_train
was 
not 
a 
good 
option 
, 
who 
wants UnrelEv_train
to 
deal+with UnrelEv_train
that 
kind 
of 
traffic 
? 
so 
we 
decide UnrelEv_train
a 
better 
idea 
was UnrelEv_train
to 
take+the+train+in Evoking_train
. 
we 
parked UnrelEv_train
our 
car 
at 
the 
train 
station 
in 
newark 
and 
prepaid RelNScrEv_train
for 
weekend 
parking UnrelEv_train
. 
i 
grabbed UnrelEv_train
a 
small 
bag 
and 
we 
went ScrEv_other_train
to 
the 
ticket 
window 
to 
purchase ScrEv_get_tickets
our 
tickets 
. 
after 
that 
we 
just 
had 
to 
wait ScrEv_wait
for 
our 
train 
to 
arrive ScrEv_train_arrives
and 
begin UnrelEv_train
boarding RelNScrEv_train
. 
once 
it 
was UnrelEv_train
at 
the 
station 
we 
were UnrelEv_train
so 
excited 
, 
we 
ran+out ScrEv_get_platform
to 
the 
platform 
and 
boarded ScrEv_get_on
one 
of 
the 
cars 
. 
we 
found ScrEv_find_place
seats 
quickly 
, 
unlike 
an 
airplane 
you 
just 
sit UnrelEv_train
where 
you 
want UnrelEv_train
. 
and 
then 
off 
we 
went ScrEv_train_departs
! 
the 
train 
seemed UnrelEv_train
to 
stop ScrEv_other_train
a 
lot 
, 
there 
were UnrelEv_train
so 
many 
more 
stations 
than 
i 
realized+were UnrelEv_train
out 
there 
. 
eventually 
though 
, 
we 
heard UnrelEv_train
those 
magic 
words 
. 
penn 
station 
! 
we 
had 
arrived ScrEv_arrive_destination
in 
new 
york 
city 
! 
<end_of_story>_train 
taking+the+train Evoking_train
into 
the 
city 
is UnrelEv_train
so 
much 
fun 
! 
we 
go ScrEv_get_train_station
into 
the 
train 
station 
and 
buy ScrEv_get_tickets
tickets 
for 
the 
train 
we 
want UnrelEv_train
to 
take Evoking_train
. 
when 
the 
train 
arrives ScrEv_train_arrives
at 
the 
station 
it 
is UnrelEv_train
very 
loud 
. 
we 
wait ScrEv_wait
for 
it 
to 
stop RelNScrEv_train
and 
then 
follow ScrEv_get_on
the 
other 
passengers 
on 
board 
. 
we 
find ScrEv_find_place
our 
seats 
, 
hopefully 
near 
a 
window 
, 
and 
sit+down UnrelEv_train
. 
when 
the 
conductor 
comes+around ScrEv_conductor_checks
, 
we 
give ScrEv_other_train
him 
our 
tickets 
and 
he 
punches ScrEv_conductor_checks
a 
hole 
in 
each 
of 
them 
. 
the 
train 
begins UnrelEv_train
to 
move ScrEv_train_departs
and 
it 
makes UnrelEv_train
a 
clickety-clack 
sound 
as 
it 
travels RelNScrEv_train
towards 
the 
next 
stop 
. 
the 
buildings 
and 
trees 
we 
pass RelNScrEv_train
look UnrelEv_train
blurry 
because 
we 
are 
going UnrelEv_train
so 
fast 
. 
we 
pass RelNScrEv_train
railroad 
crossings 
with 
cars 
lined+up+waiting+for UnrelEv_train
us 
to 
pass RelNScrEv_train
. 
after 
523 
stops 
, 
at 
different 
train 
stations 
, 
we 
arrive ScrEv_arrive_destination
at 
the 
big 
one 
in 
the 
city 
. 
we 
get+off ScrEv_get_off
the 
train 
and 
take UnrelEv_train
the 
escalator 
up 
to 
get+out ScrEv_other_train
of 
the 
station 
. 
<end_of_story>_train 
this 
morning 
i 
arrived ScrEv_get_train_station
at 
the 
train 
station 
to 
take+a+train Evoking_train
to 
my 
sisters 
house 
in 
texas 
. 
i 
had 
pre-purchased ScrEv_get_tickets
my 
ticket 
for 
the 
amtrak 
train 
leaving RelNScrEv_train
a 
523 
am 
. 
so 
i 
arrived ScrEv_get_train_station
around 
523 
minute 
before 
hand 
to 
check 
in 
and 
get 
to 
the 
platform 
in 
time 
to 
get 
my 
train 
. 
this 
was UnrelEv_train
the 
first 
time 
have 
taken+a+long+distance+train Evoking_train
and 
figured UnrelEv_train
it 
would 
be UnrelEv_train
similar 
to 
the 
local 
city 
trains 
i 
take RelNScrEv_train
to 
work 
each 
day 
. 
as 
the 
train 
boards ScrEv_other_train
i 
found ScrEv_find_place
my 
correct 
car 
and 
seat 
. 
i 
entered UnrelEv_train
the 
car 
and 
saw 
how 
much 
nicer 
these 
trains 
are 
compared UnrelEv_train
to 
the 
local 
one 
. 
the 
seats 
were UnrelEv_train
similar 
to 
seats 
on 
a 
tour 
coach 
, 
and 
was UnrelEv_train
actually 
quite 
nice 
inside 
. 
i 
brought ScrEv_spend_time_train
a 
book 
along 
to 
read ScrEv_spend_time_train
and 
help+pass UnrelEv_train
the 
time 
. 
i 
settled UnrelEv_train
in 
my 
seat 
and 
a 
nice 
elderly 
woman 
sat UnrelEv_train
down 
next 
to 
me 
, 
we 
exchanged ScrEv_spend_time_train
pleasantries 
and 
she 
puled UnrelEv_train
out 
a 
blanket 
she 
was 
crocheting UnrelEv_train
for 
her 
grandson 
. 
i 
was UnrelEv_train
fascinated 
with 
her 
work 
and 
she 
started UnrelEv_train
to 
teach UnrelEv_train
me 
as 
the 
train 
pulled ScrEv_train_departs
away 
from 
the 
platform 
. 
she 
spent UnrelEv_train
most 
of 
the 
trip 
working ScrEv_spend_time_train
on 
the 
blanket 
as 
i 
watched ScrEv_spend_time_train
. 
eight 
hours 
later 
, 
it 
seemed UnrelEv_train
like 
much 
less 
, 
the 
train 
pulled ScrEv_arrive_destination
into 
the 
station 
and 
it 
was UnrelEv_train
time 
for 
me 
to 
get+off ScrEv_get_off
. 
i 
said+good+bye UnrelEv_train
to 
the 
woman 
and 
thanked UnrelEv_train
her 
for 
teaching UnrelEv_train
me 
what 
she 
had 
. 
she 
went+back UnrelEv_train
to 
her 
work 
as 
i 
got+off ScrEv_get_off
the 
train 
. 
my 
sister 
was 
waiting RelNScrEv_train
on 
the 
platform 
for 
me 
and 
we 
got UnrelEv_train
into 
her 
car 
and 
headed UnrelEv_train
to 
the 
nearest 
craft 
store 
to 
purchase+crocheting UnrelEv_train
supplies 
. 
<end_of_story>_train 
as 
a 
young 
man 
i 
had UnrelEv_train
always 
enjoyed+watching UnrelEv_train
the 
trains 
go+by UnrelEv_train
. 
although 
there 
are UnrelEv_train
no 
passenger 
trains 
anywhere 
near 
where 
i 
live UnrelEv_train
there 
are 
trains 
that 
deliver UnrelEv_train
to 
local 
plants 
and 
factories 
. 
one 
day 
i 
decided UnrelEv_train
that 
as 
the 
train 
slowed RelNScrEv_train
down 
as 
it 
rumbled RelNScrEv_train
across 
the 
road 
while 
cars 
where 
stopped UnrelEv_train
i 
would 
run UnrelEv_train
and 
grab RelNScrEv_train
hold 
of 
one 
of 
the 
train 
car 
handles 
and 
sneak UnrelEv_train
a 
ride 
. 
off 
i 
ran UnrelEv_train
. 
i 
grabbed RelNScrEv_train
the 
handle 
and 
thought 
my 
arm 
was 
going 
to 
rip+off UnrelEv_train
as 
i 
tried UnrelEv_train
to 
pull RelNScrEv_train
myself 
onto 
the 
train 
. 
finally 
i 
made UnrelEv_train
it 
and 
climbed+up RelNScrEv_train
onto 
the 
top 
of 
the 
train 
car 
. 
i 
rode RelNScrEv_train
like 
that 
for 
several 
miles 
enjoying UnrelEv_train
the 
vibration 
and 
speed 
of 
the 
train 
as 
it 
rumbled RelNScrEv_train
along 
the 
tracks 
. 
when 
it 
slowed+down RelNScrEv_train
enough 
before 
it 
's 
next 
stop 
i 
jumped+off ScrEv_get_off
and 
hit UnrelEv_train
the 
ground 
rolling UnrelEv_train
. 
got 
battered UnrelEv_train
and 
bruised UnrelEv_train
but 
the 
experience 
was UnrelEv_train
well 
worth 
the 
pain 
. 
<end_of_story>_train 
adventures 
by 
train 
it 
was UnrelEv_train
a 
saturday 
and 
i 
felt UnrelEv_train
like 
going UnrelEv_train
on 
an 
adventure 
. 
i 
decided UnrelEv_train
to 
drive UnrelEv_train
a 
couple 
of 
hours 
away 
from 
home 
to 
this 
place 
that 
has UnrelEv_train
an 
old-fashioned 
train+that+people+can+ride Evoking_train
. 
it 
takes UnrelEv_train
you 
along 
a 
river 
and 
into 
a 
wooded 
area 
where 
you 
can 
scenery 
and 
historical 
markers 
that 
you 
ca 
n't 
get+to UnrelEv_train
by 
car 
. 
i 
paid ScrEv_get_tickets
the 
fare 
and 
got+on ScrEv_get_on
the 
train 
. 
i 
sat ScrEv_find_place
by 
a 
window 
where 
i 
would 
have UnrelEv_train
a 
great 
view 
of 
the 
scenery 
. 
as 
the 
train 
got ScrEv_train_departs
moving UnrelEv_train
, 
i 
was UnrelEv_train
glad 
that 
i 
had 
decided UnrelEv_train
to 
ride+this+train Evoking_train
. 
the 
scenery 
was+amazing UnrelEv_train
and 
i 
saw ScrEv_spend_time_train
and 
learned ScrEv_spend_time_train
information 
about 
historical 
markers 
that 
i 
had 
not 
known UnrelEv_train
before 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_train
a 
fun 
day 
and 
i 
hated UnrelEv_train
to 
see 
the 
train 
ride 
end ScrEv_arrive_destination
when 
it 
did UnrelEv_train
. 
i 
started+out UnrelEv_train
for 
home 
but 
new UnrelEv_train
i 
would 
be UnrelEv_train
back 
again 
someday 
to 
take+this+train+ride+again Evoking_train
. 
<end_of_story>_train 
i 
was 
going 
to 
visit UnrelEv_train
my 
grandmother 
in 
philadelphia 
for 
the 
weekend 
. 
i 
had 
never 
been UnrelEv_train
to 
philadelphia 
before 
but 
was UnrelEv_train
eager 
to 
try UnrelEv_train
their 
legendary 
philly 
cheese 
steak 
sandwiches 
. 
the 
quickest 
way 
was UnrelEv_train
to 
take+the+train Evoking_train
there 
. 
i 
got ScrEv_get_train_station
to 
the 
train 
station 
early 
in 
the 
morning 
and 
tried UnrelEv_train
to 
figure+out UnrelEv_train
how 
to 
get UnrelEv_train
there 
. 
i 
was UnrelEv_train
a 
little 
confused UnrelEv_train
so 
i 
asked RelNScrEv_train
one 
of 
the 
customer 
service 
representatives 
in 
the 
ticket 
booth 
. 
the 
woman 
told UnrelEv_train
me 
i 
could 
to 
take RelNScrEv_train
the 
8:05 
train 
and 
that 
it 
would 
be 
leaving RelNScrEv_train
from 
gate 
f 
. 
she 
said UnrelEv_train
that 
i 
could 
buy ScrEv_get_tickets
the 
tickets 
from 
her 
or 
from 
a 
machine 
. 
i 
decided UnrelEv_train
to 
buy ScrEv_get_tickets
it 
from 
her 
and 
it 
cost RelNScrEv_train
$ 
523 
dollars 
. 
i 
paid RelNScrEv_train
in 
cash 
and 
got ScrEv_get_tickets
my 
ticket 
. 
the 
train 
was 
leaving RelNScrEv_train
in 
ten 
minutes 
and 
the 
gate 
had 
been 
announced RelNScrEv_train
so 
i 
rushed ScrEv_get_platform
to 
the 
gate 
. 
i 
got ScrEv_get_platform
there 
with 
time 
to 
spare UnrelEv_train
and 
found ScrEv_find_place
a 
seat 
in 
the 
back 
. 
about 
an 
hour 
later 
i 
was UnrelEv_train
in 
philadelphia 
and 
was UnrelEv_train
very 
excited 
. 
<end_of_story>_train 
i 
was 
taking UnrelEv_train
a 
day 
trip 
to 
another 
city 
not 
too 
far 
away 
. 
i 
decided UnrelEv_train
to 
take+my+trip+by+train Evoking_train
. 
i 
looked+up ScrEv_other_train
a 
timetable 
for 
trains 
leaving RelNScrEv_train
my 
city 
and 
going UnrelEv_train
to 
the 
new 
city 
, 
and 
arrived ScrEv_get_train_station
at 
the 
station 
not 
too 
long 
before 
my 
train 
was UnrelEv_train
due 
to 
arrive RelNScrEv_train
. 
i 
went UnrelEv_train
to 
the 
ticket 
booth 
and 
bought ScrEv_get_tickets
my 
ticket 
. 
then 
i 
walked ScrEv_get_platform
to 
the 
platform 
to 
wait ScrEv_wait
for 
my 
train 
to 
arrive RelNScrEv_train
. 
the 
platform 
was UnrelEv_train
a 
little 
high 
in 
the 
air 
, 
and 
i 
could 
see UnrelEv_train
the 
tracks 
on 
the 
ground 
below 
. 
looking UnrelEv_train
across 
the 
tracks 
, 
there 
was UnrelEv_train
a 
similar 
platform 
on 
the 
other 
side 
for 
trains 
coming RelNScrEv_train
from 
the 
other 
direction 
. 
i 
heard UnrelEv_train
some 
clatter 
and 
a 
loud 
whistle 
, 
and 
saw UnrelEv_train
that 
my 
train 
was 
heading ScrEv_train_arrives
toward 
my 
platform 
. 
i 
stood UnrelEv_train
behind 
a 
line 
painted UnrelEv_train
on 
the 
floor 
of 
the 
platform 
, 
as 
it 
kept UnrelEv_train
me 
a 
safe 
distance 
from 
the 
arriving ScrEv_train_arrives
train 
. 
finally 
, 
it 
stopped RelNScrEv_train
, 
and 
the 
doors 
opened+up ScrEv_door_opens
. 
i 
walked ScrEv_get_on
on 
board 
and 
found ScrEv_find_place
a 
seat 
next 
to 
a 
window 
. 
when 
everyone 
was UnrelEv_train
on 
board 
, 
the 
doors 
closed ScrEv_other_train
and 
the 
train 
whistled RelNScrEv_train
again 
to 
let 
everyone 
know UnrelEv_train
that 
it 
was 
leaving ScrEv_train_departs
. 
the 
train 
rolled+down ScrEv_train_departs
the 
tracks 
. 
it 
was 
very 
roomy 
on 
the 
train 
and 
i 
was 
able 
to 
walk ScrEv_spend_time_train
up 
and 
down 
the 
aisle 
while 
the 
train 
was 
moving RelNScrEv_train
. 
finally 
, 
it 
arrived ScrEv_arrive_destination
at 
my 
destination 
and 
i 
got+off ScrEv_get_off
. 
riding+the+train Evoking_train
was UnrelEv_train
an 
easy 
and 
pleasant 
experience 
. 
<end_of_story>_train 
i 
remembered UnrelEv_train
the 
first 
long 
train+trip Evoking_train
i 
had UnrelEv_train
, 
it 
was UnrelEv_train
incredible 
. 
i 
was 
talking UnrelEv_train
to 
my 
family 
about 
going UnrelEv_train
on 
a 
trip 
to 
virginia 
and 
they 
decided UnrelEv_train
it 
was UnrelEv_train
about 
time 
we 
booked ScrEv_get_tickets
the 
trip 
. 
my 
dad 
called RelNScrEv_train
amtrak 
-lrb- 
train 
company 
-rrb- 
and 
ordered ScrEv_get_tickets
523 
tickets 
for 
the 
next 
weekend 
. 
when 
the 
weekend 
came 
we 
got+onto+the+train Evoking_train
. 
this 
train 
was UnrelEv_train
different 
, 
it 
was UnrelEv_train
a 
double-decker 
or 
a 
train 
with 
two 
floors 
. 
we 
got ScrEv_find_place
to 
our 
seats 
and 
to 
the 
side 
was UnrelEv_train
huge 
windows 
that 
went UnrelEv_train
from 
the 
back 
of 
the 
train 
car 
to 
the 
front 
. 
i 
could 
n't 
believe UnrelEv_train
how 
incredible 
all 
the 
trees 
and 
birds 
looked UnrelEv_train
. 
then 
we 
got ScrEv_spend_time_train
to 
the 
observation 
car 
. 
i 
did 
n't 
even 
think UnrelEv_train
this 
type 
of 
car 
existed UnrelEv_train
. 
the 
train 
car 
was UnrelEv_train
all 
class 
except 
for 
the 
floor 
and 
the 
lower 
parts 
of 
the 
wall 
, 
above 
was UnrelEv_train
all 
glass 
. 
then 
we 
rode ScrEv_spend_time_train
in 
the 
observation 
and 
watched ScrEv_spend_time_train
as 
the 
rain 
fell+down UnrelEv_train
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_train
an 
unbelievable 
event 
and 
i 
would 
highly 
recommend UnrelEv_train
it 
. 
<end_of_story>_train 
the 
other 
day 
, 
i 
had 
to 
catch+a+train Evoking_train
from 
los 
angles 
to 
new 
york 
at 
the 
last 
minute 
. 
my 
boss 
wanted UnrelEv_train
me 
to 
meet UnrelEv_train
some 
foreign 
client 
in 
a 
brand 
new 
art 
gallery 
they 
recently 
bought UnrelEv_train
in 
manhattan 
. 
the 
boss 
called UnrelEv_train
me 
at 
about 
5:30 
in 
the 
morning 
and 
told UnrelEv_train
me 
that 
he 
already 
bought ScrEv_get_tickets
tickets 
to 
get RelNScrEv_train
from 
here 
to 
new 
york 
, 
but 
explained UnrelEv_train
to 
me 
that 
he 
could 
n't 
make UnrelEv_train
it 
as 
he 
had UnrelEv_train
another 
meeting 
to 
that 
same 
morning 
. 
the 
tickets 
were UnrelEv_train
for 
a 
train 
that 
departed ScrEv_train_departs
at 
7:15 
am 
, 
so 
like 
a 
good 
worker 
bee 
, 
i 
got+up UnrelEv_train
, 
skipped+showering UnrelEv_train
, 
got 
dressed UnrelEv_train
, 
and 
ran+out UnrelEv_train
the 
door 
with 
a 
dirty 
wrinkled UnrelEv_train
suit 
i 
had 
n't 
had UnrelEv_train
time 
to 
wash UnrelEv_train
. 
the 
airport 
was UnrelEv_train
523 
minutes 
away 
so 
i 
had UnrelEv_train
very 
little 
time 
to 
spare UnrelEv_train
. 
i 
managed UnrelEv_train
to 
store RelNScrEv_train
my 
car 
and 
walk ScrEv_get_platform
into 
the 
train 
station 
half 
asleep 
right 
at 
7:10 
am 
when 
i 
overheard RelNScrEv_train
my 
train 
was 
delayed RelNScrEv_train
over 
the 
intercom 
. 
when 
my 
train 
was 
called RelNScrEv_train
an 
hour 
later 
, 
i 
drowsily 
made ScrEv_find_place
my 
way 
on 
board 
where 
i 
got ScrEv_find_place
a 
window 
seat 
next 
to 
a 
larger 
fellow 
. 
i 
remember UnrelEv_train
i 
was UnrelEv_train
half 
asleep 
when 
i 
mumbled UnrelEv_train
a 
hello 
to 
him 
. 
he 
happily 
greeted UnrelEv_train
me 
back 
as 
i 
sat+down ScrEv_find_place
. 
right 
before 
the 
train 
took+off ScrEv_train_departs
and 
the 
trains 
stewardesses 
were 
telling RelNScrEv_train
us 
how 
to 
use RelNScrEv_train
our 
seat 
belts 
, 
i 
barely 
remember+ending+up UnrelEv_train
falling+asleep ScrEv_spend_time_train
on 
the 
large 
man 
next 
to 
me 
. 
four 
hours 
later 
, 
i 
got UnrelEv_train
a 
nudge 
from 
the 
large 
man 
next 
to 
me 
telling UnrelEv_train
me 
kindly 
to 
wake+up UnrelEv_train
and 
that 
our 
ride Evoking_train
was UnrelEv_train
over 
. 
i 
distinctly 
remember+waking+up UnrelEv_train
with 
a 
mouthful 
of 
drool 
soaked 
on 
the 
large 
man 
' 
s 
arm 
i 
feel+asleep ScrEv_spend_time_train
on 
and 
instantly 
apologized UnrelEv_train
. 
he 
laughed UnrelEv_train
and 
said UnrelEv_train
to 
me 
don 
' 
t 
worry UnrelEv_train
about 
it 
! 
you 
looked UnrelEv_train
so 
tired UnrelEv_train
! 
would 
you 
believe UnrelEv_train
this 
is 
n't 
the 
first 
time 
this 
has 
happened UnrelEv_train
to 
me 
? 
we 
both 
kind 
of 
laughed UnrelEv_train
and 
went UnrelEv_train
on 
our 
ways 
. 
it 
ended+up+being UnrelEv_train
a 
great 
ride Evoking_train
and 
sleep 
, 
overall 
. 
<end_of_story>_train 
every 
time 
i 
have 
to 
go UnrelEv_train
to 
the 
city 
, 
i 
have 
to 
take+the+train Evoking_train
. 
one 
day 
, 
when 
i 
was+on+the+train Evoking_train
, 
i 
had 
to 
wait ScrEv_wait
twenty 
minutes 
for 
the 
next 
train 
to 
arrive ScrEv_train_arrives
. 
when 
it 
arrived ScrEv_train_arrives
, 
, 
the 
place 
was RelNScrEv_train
full 
. 
it 
was RelNScrEv_train
full 
because 
it 
was RelNScrEv_train
rush 
hour 
. 
that 
's 
the 
time 
when 
everyone 
is 
coming+out UnrelEv_train
of 
work 
or 
school 
. 
i 
could 
n't 
find ScrEv_find_place
a 
seat 
at 
all 
! 
i 
had 
to 
stand+up ScrEv_find_place
throughout 
my 
whole 
ride Evoking_train
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_train
very 
uncomfortable 
because 
i 
had 
to 
stand+up ScrEv_find_place
for 
an 
hour 
ride Evoking_train
. 
to 
make UnrelEv_train
matters 
worse 
, 
more 
people 
wanted UnrelEv_train
to 
squeeze RelNScrEv_train
inside 
the 
train 
. 
now 
everybody 
was UnrelEv_train
on 
top 
of 
one 
another 
. 
soon 
, 
the 
train 
could 
n't 
move ScrEv_other_train
anymore 
because 
there 
were UnrelEv_train
just 
too 
many 
people 
on 
the 
train 
. 
the 
door 
would 
n't 
close ScrEv_other_train
therefore 
; 
the 
conductor 
could 
n't 
drive ScrEv_other_train
the 
train 
. 
eventually 
, 
people 
started UnrelEv_train
to 
come+out ScrEv_get_off
and 
i 
was UnrelEv_train
able 
to 
breathe UnrelEv_train
. 
finally 
, 
i 
reached ScrEv_train_arrives
my 
stop 
and 
was 
relieved UnrelEv_train
to 
be UnrelEv_train
out 
of 
that 
train 
. 
<end_of_story>_train 
my 
family 
and 
i 
arrived ScrEv_get_train_station
at 
the 
station 
early 
in 
the 
morning 
because 
we 
had 
to 
make UnrelEv_train
sure 
we 
were 
on 
time 
. 
normally 
we 
are UnrelEv_train
late 
to 
almost 
everything 
we 
do UnrelEv_train
, 
so 
if 
we 
shoot UnrelEv_train
for 
being UnrelEv_train
early 
that 
normally 
means+being UnrelEv_train
on 
time 
. 
the 
train 
pulls+up ScrEv_train_arrives
and 
we 
show ScrEv_conductor_checks
our 
tickets 
and 
climb+aboard ScrEv_get_on
. 
we 
choose UnrelEv_train
to 
ride+the+train Evoking_train
because 
the 
plane 
tickets 
were UnrelEv_train
simply 
way 
to 
expensive 
. 
on 
the 
train 
we 
get ScrEv_spend_time_train
drinks 
and 
some 
snacks 
to 
pass ScrEv_spend_time_train
the 
time 
. 
we 
also 
play ScrEv_spend_time_train
cards 
and 
talk ScrEv_spend_time_train
the 
entire 
ride Evoking_train
so 
that 
in 
no 
time 
we 
have 
arrived ScrEv_train_arrives
at 
our 
destination 
. 
the 
train 
had UnrelEv_train
no 
problems 
and 
it 
seemed UnrelEv_train
like 
the 
fastest 
ride Evoking_train
i 
had 
ever 
been UnrelEv_train
on 
. 
if 
we 
would 
have 
taken UnrelEv_train
a 
plane 
it 
may 
have 
even 
taken UnrelEv_train
longer 
than 
this 
ride Evoking_train
had 
taken RelNScrEv_train
because 
of 
all 
the 
unfortunate 
things 
you 
have 
to 
go+through UnrelEv_train
at 
an 
airport 
. 
the 
train 
ride 
was UnrelEv_train
an 
enjoyable 
experience 
and 
i 
look+forward UnrelEv_train
to 
heading RelNScrEv_train
back 
home 
on 
the 
next 
train 
. 
<end_of_story>_train 
when 
i 
went UnrelEv_train
on 
vacation 
last 
year 
with 
my 
parents 
, 
we 
took+a+trip+on+a+train Evoking_train
for 
part 
of 
it 
. 
we 
picked RelNScrEv_train
the 
route 
we 
wanted UnrelEv_train
to 
take RelNScrEv_train
to 
go 
visit UnrelEv_train
my 
uncle 
, 
and 
had RelNScrEv_train
everything 
ready 
the 
day 
before 
, 
such 
as 
our 
suitcases 
. 
when 
the 
day 
arrived RelNScrEv_train
for 
us 
to 
go UnrelEv_train
, 
my 
dad 
drove ScrEv_get_train_station
us 
to 
the 
train 
station 
where 
we 
parked RelNScrEv_train
in 
a 
designated UnrelEv_train
lot 
, 
since 
we 
would 
be 
returning RelNScrEv_train
to 
the 
same 
train 
station 
. 
we 
then 
headed ScrEv_get_train_station
to 
the 
train 
station 
and 
went ScrEv_get_train_station
inside 
where 
my 
dad 
purchased ScrEv_get_tickets
our 
tickets 
. 
we 
had UnrelEv_train
some 
extra 
time 
, 
so 
we 
wandered ScrEv_wait
around 
and 
found UnrelEv_train
a 
little 
gift 
shop 
where 
we 
could 
buy UnrelEv_train
souvenirs 
. 
when 
it 
was UnrelEv_train
time 
to 
board ScrEv_get_on
our 
train 
, 
we 
walked+through ScrEv_get_platform
the 
station 
to 
get ScrEv_get_platform
to 
the 
correct 
area 
. 
there 
were UnrelEv_train
long 
hallways 
to 
get ScrEv_get_platform
there 
, 
and 
then 
we 
went+up ScrEv_get_platform
a 
concrete 
pathway 
to 
where 
the 
train 
was RelNScrEv_train
outside 
. 
we 
had 
to 
give ScrEv_conductor_checks
the 
ticket 
taker 
our 
tickets 
so 
she 
could 
verify ScrEv_conductor_checks
we 
were 
getting+on ScrEv_get_on
the 
right 
train 
. 
we 
all 
gathered ScrEv_get_on
in 
the 
train 
and 
found ScrEv_find_place
some 
seats 
that 
had 
n't 
been 
taken RelNScrEv_train
. 
we 
stored ScrEv_other_train
our 
luggage 
and 
prepared UnrelEv_train
for 
the 
train 
to 
begin UnrelEv_train
its 
journey Evoking_train
. 
once 
it 
was UnrelEv_train
time 
to 
leave ScrEv_train_departs
, 
we 
watched+out ScrEv_spend_time_train
the 
windows 
at 
all 
the 
passing UnrelEv_train
scenery 
. 
after 
awhile 
, 
we 
all 
started UnrelEv_train
doing ScrEv_spend_time_train
our 
own 
thing 
like 
reading ScrEv_spend_time_train
or 
playing ScrEv_spend_time_train
cards 
to 
pass ScrEv_spend_time_train
the 
time 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_train
a 
lot 
of 
fun 
and 
really 
neat 
to 
take+a+train+trip Evoking_train
. 
<end_of_story>_train 
the 
last 
train+trip+i+took Evoking_train
was 
with 
a 
couple 
of 
friends 
to 
go UnrelEv_train
and 
check+out UnrelEv_train
an 
art 
museum 
that 
was UnrelEv_train
fairly 
far 
away 
. 
we 
met+up RelNScrEv_train
at 
the 
station 
with 
plenty 
of 
time 
to 
spare UnrelEv_train
, 
so 
we 
chatted RelNScrEv_train
for 
a 
bit 
while 
we 
waited ScrEv_wait
. 
we 
had 
already 
purchased ScrEv_get_tickets
our 
tickets 
ahead 
of 
time 
, 
just 
to 
make UnrelEv_train
things 
easier 
. 
when 
the 
train 
arrived ScrEv_train_arrives
, 
we 
boarded ScrEv_get_on
and 
found ScrEv_find_place
our 
seats 
. 
we 
did 
n't 
bring RelNScrEv_train
much 
, 
just 
small 
bags 
, 
so 
we 
did 
n't 
have 
to 
stow ScrEv_other_train
anything 
. 
the 
conductor 
came ScrEv_conductor_checks
by 
and 
checked ScrEv_conductor_checks
our 
tickets 
as 
the 
train 
left ScrEv_train_departs
the 
station 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_train
a 
nice 
ride Evoking_train
. 
the 
train 
seats 
are UnrelEv_train
always 
fairly 
comfortable 
and 
we 
had UnrelEv_train
time 
to 
play ScrEv_spend_time_train
racing 
games 
on 
our 
dss 
while 
we 
rode RelNScrEv_train
. 
i 
also 
got 
to 
watch ScrEv_spend_time_train
some 
rather 
lovely 
scenery 
, 
once 
we 
got+out RelNScrEv_train
of 
the 
city 
. 
going+by RelNScrEv_train
trees 
and 
landscapes 
and 
watching ScrEv_spend_time_train
them 
pass 
is UnrelEv_train
pretty 
fun 
too 
. 
plus 
, 
there 
were RelNScrEv_train
n't 
that 
many 
other 
people 
in 
the 
train 
car 
that 
we 
were UnrelEv_train
in 
, 
so 
it 
was UnrelEv_train
a 
nice 
and 
peaceful 
ride Evoking_train
. 
<end_of_story>_train 
last 
month 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_train
to 
go 
visit UnrelEv_train
my 
parents 
in 
florida 
, 
but 
i 
hate UnrelEv_train
to 
fly UnrelEv_train
. 
after 
thinking UnrelEv_train
about 
it 
for 
a 
little 
while 
, 
i 
decided UnrelEv_train
to 
take+the+train Evoking_train
. 
it 
's UnrelEv_train
not 
as 
fast 
as 
flying UnrelEv_train
but 
it 
is UnrelEv_train
a 
lot 
faster 
than 
driving UnrelEv_train
. 
i 
got RelNScrEv_train
on 
my 
computer 
and 
pulled+up ScrEv_check_time-table
the 
train 
schedules 
to 
see UnrelEv_train
if 
there 
was UnrelEv_train
one 
that 
would 
work UnrelEv_train
to 
get RelNScrEv_train
me 
where 
i 
was 
going RelNScrEv_train
. 
after 
checking ScrEv_check_time-table
a 
few 
, 
i 
found ScrEv_check_time-table
one 
headed ScrEv_train_arrives
the 
way 
i 
needed UnrelEv_train
to 
go RelNScrEv_train
that 
was 
also 
running RelNScrEv_train
at 
the 
right 
time 
. 
i 
bought ScrEv_get_tickets
a 
round 
trip 
ticket 
right 
from 
the 
website 
. 
since 
it 
would 
only 
take RelNScrEv_train
523 
hours 
to 
get ScrEv_train_arrives
there 
, 
i 
did 
n't 
bother UnrelEv_train
getting RelNScrEv_train
a 
spot 
in 
a 
sleeper 
car 
, 
just 
a 
regular 
seat 
. 
i 
packed+up ScrEv_other_train
the 
things 
i 
needed UnrelEv_train
and 
headed ScrEv_get_train_station
to 
the 
train 
station 
. 
once 
i 
was ScrEv_get_train_station
there 
i 
checked+in RelNScrEv_train
and 
got+on ScrEv_get_on
the 
train 
. 
about 
523 
minutes 
later 
it 
was UnrelEv_train
time 
to 
go ScrEv_train_departs
and 
the 
train 
rumbled+out ScrEv_train_departs
of 
the 
station 
. 
i 
had ScrEv_find_place
a 
window 
seat 
, 
so 
i 
could 
watch ScrEv_spend_time_train
the 
scenery 
go RelNScrEv_train
by 
as 
we 
sped RelNScrEv_train
along 
the 
tracks 
. 
after 
a 
little 
while 
i 
decided UnrelEv_train
to 
go+up RelNScrEv_train
to 
the 
food 
car 
and 
get ScrEv_spend_time_train
some 
lunch 
. 
i 
sat ScrEv_spend_time_train
in 
the 
food 
car 
, 
ate ScrEv_spend_time_train
and 
played ScrEv_spend_time_train
a 
game 
on 
my 
tablet 
. 
after 
a 
while 
i 
went+back RelNScrEv_train
to 
my 
seat 
, 
plugged ScrEv_spend_time_train
my 
headphones 
into 
my 
tablet 
and 
just 
watched ScrEv_spend_time_train
the 
country 
roll+by RelNScrEv_train
while 
i 
listened ScrEv_spend_time_train
to 
my 
music 
. 
we 
got ScrEv_arrive_destination
to 
florida 
on 
time 
and 
i 
had UnrelEv_train
a 
great 
visit 
with 
my 
parents 
, 
and 
best 
of 
all 
, 
i 
did 
n't 
have 
to 
fly UnrelEv_train
! 
<end_of_story>_train 
my 
family 
and 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_train
to 
take+a+trip+via+train Evoking_train
across 
the 
country 
. 
i 
called UnrelEv_train
a 
travel 
agent 
to 
set+up UnrelEv_train
a 
time 
to 
meet UnrelEv_train
with 
them 
and 
discuss UnrelEv_train
the 
necessary 
arrangements 
. 
a 
few 
days 
later 
the 
appointment 
arrived UnrelEv_train
and 
i 
went UnrelEv_train
to 
the 
travel 
agent 
's 
office 
to 
meet UnrelEv_train
with 
them 
. 
after 
discussing UnrelEv_train
our 
travel 
plans 
we 
decided UnrelEv_train
that 
getting+a+private+room+on+a+sleeper+car Evoking_train
for 
the 
family 
would 
be UnrelEv_train
the 
best 
option 
. 
i 
purchased ScrEv_get_tickets
the 
tickets 
and 
then 
went UnrelEv_train
home 
to 
tell UnrelEv_train
the 
family 
we 
were 
going UnrelEv_train
and 
to 
pack ScrEv_other_train
. 
a 
week 
later 
we 
arrived ScrEv_get_train_station
at 
the 
train 
station 
an 
hour 
before 
boarding ScrEv_get_on
time 
to 
make UnrelEv_train
sure 
that 
we 
did 
not 
miss RelNScrEv_train
the 
train 
. 
once 
it 
was RelNScrEv_train
time 
we 
boarded ScrEv_get_on
the 
train 
and 
found ScrEv_find_place
our 
room 
. 
we 
stowed ScrEv_other_train
our 
luggage 
and 
discovered UnrelEv_train
how 
the 
beds 
worked UnrelEv_train
. 
later 
it 
was 
time 
to 
eat ScrEv_spend_time_train
and 
we 
went RelNScrEv_train
to 
the 
dining 
car 
at 
our 
scheduled RelNScrEv_train
time 
far 
dinner 
. 
after 
which 
we 
went UnrelEv_train
back 
to 
our 
room 
where 
we 
did 
some 
talking ScrEv_spend_time_train
before 
finally 
falling+asleep ScrEv_spend_time_train
. 
when 
we 
woke+up UnrelEv_train
we 
were RelNScrEv_train
only 
an 
hour 
from 
our 
destination 
. 
we 
had UnrelEv_train
enough 
time 
to 
get 
changed RelNScrEv_train
and 
pack RelNScrEv_train
our 
things 
up 
and 
before 
we 
knew UnrelEv_train
it 
we 
were 
getting+off ScrEv_get_off
the 
train 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_train
a 
very 
pleasurable 
experience 
. 
<end_of_story>_train 
riding+on+a+train Evoking_train
is UnrelEv_train
a 
great 
way 
to 
commute UnrelEv_train
, 
especially 
when 
frequenting UnrelEv_train
a 
city 
! 
it 
's UnrelEv_train
a 
great 
reminder 
of 
transportation 
of 
the 
past 
, 
and 
a 
great 
way 
to 
spend UnrelEv_train
an 
afternoon 
. 
a 
specific 
example 
would 
be UnrelEv_train
when 
i 
frequent RelNScrEv_train
the 
great 
city 
of 
boston 
. 
i 
always 
choose UnrelEv_train
to 
take+the+train Evoking_train
in 
, 
as 
driving UnrelEv_train
into 
the 
big 
city 
can 
be UnrelEv_train
a 
great 
hassle 
. 
in 
this 
day 
and 
age 
it 
's UnrelEv_train
convenient 
to 
look+up ScrEv_check_time-table
train 
times 
ahead 
of 
time 
on 
the 
appropriate 
website 
. 
once 
you 
determine ScrEv_check_time-table
the 
train 
that 
you 
will 
take RelNScrEv_train
you 
will 
need UnrelEv_train
to 
find ScrEv_get_train_station
transportation 
to 
the 
train 
stop 
, 
either 
by 
walking 
, 
bus 
, 
or 
getting 
dropped+off ScrEv_get_train_station
. 
once 
at 
the 
train 
station 
go+up RelNScrEv_train
to 
the 
ticket 
window 
or 
use RelNScrEv_train
a 
handy 
kiosk 
to 
purchase ScrEv_get_tickets
your 
ticket 
. 
take ScrEv_get_tickets
this 
ticket 
and 
head RelNScrEv_train
through 
the 
checkpoint 
, 
or 
if 
you 
are 
using RelNScrEv_train
a 
commuter 
rail 
bring RelNScrEv_train
it 
with 
you 
to 
give ScrEv_conductor_checks
to 
the 
train 
attendant 
. 
as 
you 
start UnrelEv_train
moving ScrEv_train_departs
and 
stopping ScrEv_train_arrives
they 
will 
announce RelNScrEv_train
each 
stop 
. 
wait ScrEv_wait
until 
your 
stop 
has 
approached ScrEv_train_arrives
and 
exit ScrEv_get_off
the 
train 
. 
congratulations 
, 
you 
just 
saw UnrelEv_train
the 
countryside 
! 
<end_of_story>_train 
the 
night 
before 
i 
take+a+train+ride Evoking_train
, 
i 
look ScrEv_check_time-table
at 
the 
train 
schedule 
. 
usually 
i 
am 
going RelNScrEv_train
to 
new 
york 
city 
, 
so 
i 
check ScrEv_check_time-table
the 
train 
schedules 
for 
the 
trains 
heading ScrEv_train_arrives
there 
. 
when 
my 
husband 
and 
i 
take+the+train Evoking_train
, 
we 
go UnrelEv_train
early 
, 
so 
that 
morning 
i 
wake+up UnrelEv_train
early 
and 
get UnrelEv_train
ready 
for 
the 
day 
. 
we 
then 
drive ScrEv_get_train_station
to 
the 
train 
station 
and 
park UnrelEv_train
our 
car 
. 
depending UnrelEv_train
on 
which 
train 
station 
we 
are 
going ScrEv_get_train_station
to 
, 
the 
parking 
is UnrelEv_train
free 
, 
but 
otherwise 
we 
pay UnrelEv_train
for 
our 
parking 
. 
once 
parked UnrelEv_train
, 
we 
walk ScrEv_get_platform
to 
the 
platform 
and 
buy ScrEv_get_tickets
our 
tickets 
at 
the 
automated 
teller 
. 
then 
we 
wait ScrEv_wait
for 
the 
train 
to 
arrive ScrEv_train_arrives
. 
when 
the 
train 
arrives ScrEv_train_arrives
, 
we 
find ScrEv_find_place
a 
good 
place 
to 
sit ScrEv_spend_time_train
. 
we 
try UnrelEv_train
to 
sit ScrEv_spend_time_train
where 
there 
are UnrelEv_train
n't 
too 
many 
people 
and 
where 
there 
are RelNScrEv_train
only 
523 
seats 
so 
that 
we 
do 
n't 
have 
to 
sit ScrEv_spend_time_train
with 
strangers 
. 
then 
the 
train 
takes+off ScrEv_train_departs
and 
we 
usually 
are UnrelEv_train
on 
the 
train 
for 
an 
hour 
before 
we 
get ScrEv_train_arrives
to 
our 
destination 
. 
<end_of_story>_train 
yes 
going+on+a+train Evoking_train
, 
this 
is 
was UnrelEv_train
our 
ideal 
weekend 
activity 
not 
too 
long 
ago 
. 
we 
purchased ScrEv_get_tickets
tickets 
to 
travel RelNScrEv_train
from 
boston 
to 
new 
york 
city 
. 
as 
we 
entered ScrEv_get_platform
the 
platform 
of 
the 
train 
is 
was UnrelEv_train
pure 
steel 
and 
looked UnrelEv_train
so 
solidly 
strong 
. 
we 
walked+down RelNScrEv_train
the 
isle 
and 
found ScrEv_find_place
an 
comfortable 
looking UnrelEv_train
seat 
and 
decided UnrelEv_train
to 
sit ScrEv_find_place
there 
. 
shortly 
the 
train 
horn 
blasted RelNScrEv_train
making 
me 
jump UnrelEv_train
of 
my 
seat 
lol 
. 
anyway 
we 
soon 
started UnrelEv_train
moving ScrEv_train_departs
and 
our 
train+ride Evoking_train
was UnrelEv_train
underway 
. 
the 
conductor 
walked ScrEv_conductor_checks
the 
isles 
and 
collected ScrEv_conductor_checks
our 
tickets 
. 
love UnrelEv_train
scenery 
so 
i 
had UnrelEv_train
the 
window 
seat 
watching ScrEv_spend_time_train
everything 
along 
the 
way 
. 
first 
i 
saw UnrelEv_train
large 
suburban 
areas 
but 
as 
we 
got ScrEv_train_arrives
into 
connecticut 
many 
farms 
were 
being 
spotted UnrelEv_train
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_train
n't 
very 
hilly 
but 
sure 
was UnrelEv_train
a 
country 
atmosphere 
. 
soon 
we 
approached ScrEv_arrive_destination
nyc 
and 
the 
train 
came ScrEv_train_arrives
to 
slow 
stop 
, 
we 
had 
arrived ScrEv_arrive_destination
at 
our 
destination 
. 
the 
ride 
overall 
was UnrelEv_train
rather 
smooth 
and 
it 
did 
n't 
seem UnrelEv_train
to 
take RelNScrEv_train
all 
that 
long 
. 
<end_of_story>_train 
i 
decided UnrelEv_train
that 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_train
to 
visit UnrelEv_train
a 
town 
that 
was UnrelEv_train
about 
an 
hour 
away 
from 
me 
. 
rather 
than 
drive UnrelEv_train
, 
i 
decided UnrelEv_train
that 
it 
would 
be UnrelEv_train
a 
good 
day 
to 
take+a+ride+on+the+train Evoking_train
. 
i 
made UnrelEv_train
sure 
that 
i 
had RelNScrEv_train
all 
my 
things 
together 
and 
drove ScrEv_get_train_station
to 
the 
train 
station 
. 
i 
parked UnrelEv_train
in 
the 
designated UnrelEv_train
parking 
lot 
across 
the 
street 
, 
and 
went ScrEv_get_train_station
into 
the 
small 
station 
. 
i 
waited ScrEv_wait
at 
the 
counter 
for 
a 
few 
minutes 
before 
an 
attendant 
strolled+out RelNScrEv_train
from 
the 
office 
. 
she 
smiled UnrelEv_train
and 
asked UnrelEv_train
me 
where 
i 
would 
like 
to 
go RelNScrEv_train
. 
i 
told UnrelEv_train
her 
that 
i 
'd 
like ScrEv_get_tickets
a 
round 
trip 
ticket 
for 
today 
to 
the 
nearby 
town 
. 
she 
got RelNScrEv_train
on 
her 
computer 
to 
confirm ScrEv_get_tickets
my 
route 
and 
times 
, 
and 
i 
decided UnrelEv_train
to 
purchase ScrEv_get_tickets
the 
tickets 
. 
i 
gave ScrEv_get_tickets
the 
attendant 
my 
money 
, 
and 
she 
put RelNScrEv_train
it 
in 
her 
drawer 
while 
my 
tickets 
printed+off ScrEv_get_tickets
her 
printer 
. 
i 
thanked UnrelEv_train
her 
, 
and 
set+out UnrelEv_train
the 
door 
to 
wait ScrEv_wait
for 
my 
train 
. 
shortly 
after 
i 
sat+down RelNScrEv_train
, 
i 
could 
hear RelNScrEv_train
the 
sound 
of 
the 
train 
in 
the 
distance 
. 
once 
it 
was 
stopped ScrEv_train_arrives
and 
unloaded RelNScrEv_train
, 
the 
conductor 
shouted RelNScrEv_train
all 
aboard 
! 
and 
i 
gave ScrEv_conductor_checks
him 
my 
ticket 
. 
i 
boarded ScrEv_get_on
the 
train 
and 
set+off ScrEv_train_departs
. 
and 
that 
's UnrelEv_train
how 
i 
rode+the+train Evoking_train
. 
<end_of_story>_train 
after 
eating UnrelEv_train
breakfast 
this 
morning 
i 
noticed UnrelEv_train
that 
it 
was UnrelEv_train
time 
for 
me 
to 
get+off UnrelEv_train
to 
work 
so 
i 
decided UnrelEv_train
to 
walk+down ScrEv_get_train_station
to 
the 
train 
station 
so 
i 
could 
be RelNScrEv_train
off 
to 
work 
. 
i 
always 
take+the+same+train Evoking_train
to 
work 
every 
day 
and 
i 
usually 
see UnrelEv_train
a 
lot 
the 
same 
faces 
when 
i 
ride+the+train Evoking_train
. 
i 
bought ScrEv_get_tickets
a 
ticket 
at 
the 
front 
and 
waited ScrEv_wait
for 
the 
train 
to 
arrive ScrEv_train_arrives
. 
once 
the 
train 
arrived ScrEv_train_arrives
i 
boarded ScrEv_get_on
the 
train 
and 
took ScrEv_find_place
a 
seat 
. 
i 
had 
to 
go RelNScrEv_train
523 
stops 
before 
i 
would 
arrive ScrEv_arrive_destination
to 
work 
so 
i 
took+out ScrEv_spend_time_train
my 
phone 
and 
decided UnrelEv_train
to 
send+out ScrEv_spend_time_train
some 
emails 
. 
after 
the 
first 
few 
stops 
the 
train 
started UnrelEv_train
to 
get 
quite 
crowded RelNScrEv_train
so 
i 
decided UnrelEv_train
to 
stand RelNScrEv_train
and 
give RelNScrEv_train
my 
seat 
up 
to 
an 
elderly 
gentleman 
. 
he 
was UnrelEv_train
thankful 
for 
the 
seat 
and 
i 
was UnrelEv_train
happy 
to 
do UnrelEv_train
him 
the 
favor 
. 
the 
train 
then 
arrived ScrEv_train_arrives
at 
my 
stop 
and 
i 
got+off ScrEv_get_off
to 
make UnrelEv_train
my 
way 
to 
work 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_train
another 
enjoyable 
experience+on+the+train Evoking_train
. 
<end_of_story>_train 
this 
morning 
we 
needed UnrelEv_train
to 
take+the+train Evoking_train
into 
the 
city 
. 
we 
grabbed RelNScrEv_train
our 
laptop 
computers 
to 
use UnrelEv_train
while 
we 
were 
going 
to 
be 
traveling UnrelEv_train
. 
we 
had 
to 
make UnrelEv_train
sure 
we 
also 
remembered UnrelEv_train
our 
passes 
to 
get+on ScrEv_get_on
the 
train 
. 
as 
we 
arrived ScrEv_get_train_station
at 
the 
station 
, 
we 
saw UnrelEv_train
the 
train 
coming+in ScrEv_train_arrives
. 
many 
people 
got+off ScrEv_get_off
the 
train 
when 
it 
arrived ScrEv_train_arrives
and 
then 
we 
entered ScrEv_get_on
the 
train 
. 
we 
were 
able 
to 
find ScrEv_find_place
seats 
even 
though 
the 
train 
was RelNScrEv_train
pretty 
full 
. 
as 
the 
train 
left ScrEv_train_departs
the 
station 
we 
started UnrelEv_train
working ScrEv_spend_time_train
on 
our 
computers 
, 
and 
the 
523 
minute 
ride Evoking_train
seemed UnrelEv_train
to 
just 
fly UnrelEv_train
by 
. 
the 
view 
of 
the 
city 
from 
the 
train 
was UnrelEv_train
beautiful 
. 
when 
we 
arrived ScrEv_train_arrives
at 
the 
station 
in 
the 
city 
, 
the 
people 
on 
the 
train 
started UnrelEv_train
to 
queue+up ScrEv_wait
at 
the 
doorways 
. 
the 
train 
came ScrEv_train_arrives
to 
a 
smooth 
stop 
and 
all 
the 
people 
poured+out ScrEv_get_off
onto 
the 
platform 
where 
it 
was 
lightly 
raining UnrelEv_train
. 
<end_of_story>_train 
i 
had 
decided UnrelEv_train
that 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_train
to 
visit UnrelEv_train
my 
friend 
paul 
whom 
lives UnrelEv_train
quite 
a 
distance 
away 
. 
with 
this 
and 
my 
fear 
of 
air 
travel 
in 
mind 
i 
decided UnrelEv_train
to 
take+a+train Evoking_train
. 
after 
researching RelNScrEv_train
and 
finding ScrEv_check_time-table
one 
online 
i 
was UnrelEv_train
well 
on 
my 
way 
to 
going UnrelEv_train
to 
see UnrelEv_train
my 
friend 
paul 
. 
i 
drive ScrEv_get_train_station
to 
the 
station 
and 
decide UnrelEv_train
that 
i 
am 
going 
to 
purchase ScrEv_get_tickets
a 
round 
trip 
ticket 
as 
this 
would 
be UnrelEv_train
cheaper 
than 
just 
buying ScrEv_get_tickets
both 
tickets 
separately 
. 
i 
purchase ScrEv_get_tickets
my 
ticket 
and 
then 
go UnrelEv_train
to 
sit+down RelNScrEv_train
and 
wait ScrEv_wait
for 
my 
train 
. 
whenever 
my 
train 
arrives ScrEv_train_arrives
i 
have 
to 
get ScrEv_wait
in 
line 
as 
they 
process ScrEv_conductor_checks
our 
tickets 
. 
after 
all 
this 
is 
done UnrelEv_train
i 
decide UnrelEv_train
to 
take ScrEv_find_place
a 
seat 
by 
the 
window 
. 
i 
sit ScrEv_find_place
and 
fall+asleep ScrEv_spend_time_train
a 
bit 
as 
i 
ride+on+the+train Evoking_train
for 
hours 
. 
after 
a 
couple 
hours 
we 
finally 
reach ScrEv_train_arrives
the 
destination 
and 
i 
get+off ScrEv_get_off
the 
train 
, 
excited UnrelEv_train
to 
see UnrelEv_train
my 
friend 
. 
<end_of_story>_train 
i 
was UnrelEv_train
on 
spring 
break 
from 
school 
and 
decided UnrelEv_train
to 
come UnrelEv_train
home 
for 
the 
week 
. 
i 
did 
n't 
have UnrelEv_train
a 
car 
so 
i 
had+to+the+train Evoking_train
. 
i 
packed ScrEv_other_train
a 
small 
bag 
and 
took ScrEv_get_train_station
a 
cab 
to 
the 
train 
station 
. 
i 
went+up RelNScrEv_train
to 
the 
window 
and 
bought ScrEv_get_tickets
a 
ticket 
to 
my 
hometown 
. 
i 
decided UnrelEv_train
to 
buy RelNScrEv_train
a 
few 
snacks 
and 
magazines 
that 
local 
vendors 
were 
selling RelNScrEv_train
while 
i 
waited ScrEv_wait
for 
the 
train 
. 
it 
came ScrEv_train_arrives
time 
to 
board ScrEv_get_on
the 
train 
and 
i 
grabbed RelNScrEv_train
my 
things 
. 
i 
got+on ScrEv_get_on
the 
train 
and 
sat+down ScrEv_find_place
by 
the 
window 
seat 
so 
that 
i 
can 
enjoy ScrEv_spend_time_train
the 
view 
. 
the 
train 
announced RelNScrEv_train
it 
's 
next 
destination 
and 
started UnrelEv_train
to 
take+off ScrEv_train_departs
. 
the 
conductor 
came+down ScrEv_conductor_checks
the 
aisles 
and 
was 
checking ScrEv_conductor_checks
everyone 
's 
ticket 
. 
i 
had RelNScrEv_train
my 
ticket 
ready 
and 
handed ScrEv_conductor_checks
him 
my 
ticket 
when 
he 
got RelNScrEv_train
to 
me 
. 
i 
got RelNScrEv_train
comfortable 
and 
started UnrelEv_train
to 
read ScrEv_spend_time_train
a 
magazine 
while 
waiting ScrEv_spend_time_train
to 
arrive ScrEv_train_arrives
at 
my 
destination 
. 
awhile 
later 
the 
train 
had 
arrived ScrEv_train_arrives
at 
my 
hometown 
. 
i 
got+off ScrEv_get_off
the 
train 
and 
met UnrelEv_train
my 
parents 
outside 
the 
train 
station 
who 
came UnrelEv_train
to 
pick RelNScrEv_train
me 
up 
. 
<end_of_story>_train 
last 
weekend 
i 
booked ScrEv_get_tickets
a 
spur 
of 
the 
moment 
trip+out+to+new+york+on+a+train Evoking_train
. 
i 
bought ScrEv_get_tickets
my 
ticket 
for 
the 
train 
right 
at 
the 
station 
, 
i 
was UnrelEv_train
lucky 
they 
had 
some 
left RelNScrEv_train
. 
after 
waiting ScrEv_wait
about 
thirty 
minutes 
my 
train 
pulled+up ScrEv_train_arrives
and 
came ScrEv_train_arrives
to 
a 
stop 
. 
i 
hopped ScrEv_get_on
on 
the 
train 
and 
found ScrEv_find_place
an 
open 
seat 
next 
to 
the 
window 
. 
after 
everyone 
was RelNScrEv_train
on 
the 
train 
slowly 
eased ScrEv_train_departs
forward 
as 
it 
built+up RelNScrEv_train
speed 
to 
new 
york 
. 
i 
enjoyed UnrelEv_train
listening ScrEv_spend_time_train
to 
the 
wheels 
of 
the 
train 
on 
the 
track 
as 
they 
clicked RelNScrEv_train
. 
the 
train+ride Evoking_train
was UnrelEv_train
smooth 
and 
i 
was 
even 
able 
to 
get ScrEv_spend_time_train
some 
rest 
along 
the 
way 
. 
as 
the 
train 
arrived ScrEv_train_arrives
in 
new 
york 
the 
conductor 
came+over RelNScrEv_train
the 
loud 
speaker 
and 
let 
us 
know UnrelEv_train
we 
would 
be ScrEv_train_arrives
at 
our 
destination 
shortly 
. 
once 
the 
train 
slowed ScrEv_train_arrives
to 
a 
complete 
stop 
, 
me 
and 
all 
the 
other 
passengers 
filed+out ScrEv_get_off
and 
went UnrelEv_train
our 
separate 
ways 
. 
<end_of_story>_train 
taking+a+train Evoking_train
somewhere 
can 
be UnrelEv_train
an 
old-fashioned 
way 
of 
travel 
, 
but 
it 
can 
also 
be UnrelEv_train
a 
lot 
of 
fun 
! 
train 
tracks 
do 
n't 
go UnrelEv_train
everywhere 
anymore 
and 
they 
certainly 
are 
n't 
used UnrelEv_train
as 
often 
. 
this 
can 
make UnrelEv_train
travel 
a 
little 
bit 
more 
difficult 
. 
i 
decided UnrelEv_train
to 
take+a+train Evoking_train
to 
visit UnrelEv_train
my 
friend 
one 
day 
. 
i 
found ScrEv_get_tickets
a 
great 
deal 
on 
train 
tickets 
and 
decided UnrelEv_train
to 
travel RelNScrEv_train
the 
country 
the 
old-fashioned 
way 
. 
i 
ordered ScrEv_get_tickets
my 
tickets 
on 
a 
computer 
and 
arranged UnrelEv_train
my 
whole 
trip Evoking_train
. 
i 
packed+up ScrEv_other_train
my 
belongings 
, 
just 
like 
you 
would 
if 
you 
were 
flying UnrelEv_train
a 
plane 
- 
both 
have RelNScrEv_train
a 
specific 
departure 
time 
! 
instead 
of 
going UnrelEv_train
to 
an 
airport 
, 
i 
showed+up ScrEv_get_train_station
at 
the 
train 
station 
with 
my 
luggage 
and 
train 
tickets 
. 
i 
stowed+away ScrEv_other_train
my 
luggage 
and 
handed ScrEv_conductor_checks
my 
ticket 
over 
. 
i 
found ScrEv_find_place
a 
great 
car 
with 
a 
bed 
and 
a 
shared UnrelEv_train
bathroom 
and 
had UnrelEv_train
a 
very 
enjoyable 
train+trip Evoking_train
! 
<end_of_story>_train 
i 
stood ScrEv_wait
at 
the 
train 
station 
with 
my 
luggage 
bags 
waiting ScrEv_wait
to 
take+the+train Evoking_train
to 
the 
nearest 
airport 
. 
i 
took+the+train Evoking_train
solely 
due 
to 
convenience 
of 
not 
having 
to 
drive UnrelEv_train
my 
car 
and 
leave UnrelEv_train
it 
at 
the 
airport 
. 
once 
the 
train 
arrived ScrEv_train_arrives
at 
the 
destination 
, 
i 
picked+up RelNScrEv_train
my 
bags 
and 
headed+in ScrEv_get_on
to 
take ScrEv_find_place
my 
seat 
. 
i 
took ScrEv_find_place
a 
compartment 
all 
to 
myself 
as 
there 
were UnrelEv_train
not 
many 
other 
people 
on 
the 
same 
train 
. 
as 
a 
result 
, 
i 
got 
to 
relax ScrEv_spend_time_train
and 
have UnrelEv_train
a 
compartment 
with 
complete 
silence 
, 
where 
i 
then 
took ScrEv_spend_time_train
a 
nap 
. 
moments 
later 
, 
an 
attendant 
came ScrEv_conductor_checks
by 
to 
check ScrEv_conductor_checks
everyone 
's 
tickets 
. 
i 
showed ScrEv_conductor_checks
him 
my 
ticket 
, 
to 
which 
he 
tore+off ScrEv_conductor_checks
the 
perforated UnrelEv_train
bottom 
portion 
and 
handed ScrEv_conductor_checks
the 
ticket 
back 
to 
me 
. 
once 
the 
train 
arrived ScrEv_train_arrives
at 
the 
airport 
about 
523 
minutes 
later 
, 
i 
grabbed RelNScrEv_train
my 
luggage 
and 
headed+out ScrEv_move_exit
of 
the 
compartment 
to 
the 
front 
of 
the 
train 
. 
i 
exited ScrEv_get_off
the 
train 
and 
went UnrelEv_train
to 
my 
flight 
. 
<end_of_story>_train 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_train
to 
take+a+train+trip Evoking_train
through 
the 
countryside 
. 
i 
went ScrEv_get_train_station
to 
the 
local 
train 
station 
. 
once 
i 
was ScrEv_get_train_station
at 
the 
station 
i 
carefully 
reviewed ScrEv_check_time-table
the 
train 
schedule 
until 
i 
found ScrEv_check_time-table
a 
train 
that 
was 
going RelNScrEv_train
where 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_train
to 
go RelNScrEv_train
at 
a 
convenient 
time 
. 
the 
trip 
i 
picked RelNScrEv_train
happened UnrelEv_train
to 
leave ScrEv_train_departs
at 
523 
am 
the 
next 
day 
. 
i 
went ScrEv_get_tickets
to 
the 
ticket 
window 
and 
bought ScrEv_get_tickets
a 
round 
trip 
ticket 
for 
the 
train 
i 
had 
selected RelNScrEv_train
. 
having 
purchased ScrEv_get_tickets
my 
tickets 
, 
i 
went UnrelEv_train
home 
and 
i 
packed RelNScrEv_train
a 
light 
suitcase 
with 
the 
necessities 
i 
would 
need UnrelEv_train
for 
my 
trip 
. 
that 
evening 
i 
set UnrelEv_train
my 
alarm 
clock 
extra 
early 
so 
i 
would 
be UnrelEv_train
sure 
to 
be RelNScrEv_train
on 
time 
for 
the 
train 
. 
i 
woke+up UnrelEv_train
the 
next 
morning 
thanks UnrelEv_train
to 
my 
early 
alarm 
clock 
. 
i 
then 
showered UnrelEv_train
, 
ate UnrelEv_train
my 
breakfast 
and 
took ScrEv_other_train
my 
suitcase 
and 
left UnrelEv_train
home 
for 
the 
train 
station 
. 
i 
arrived ScrEv_get_train_station
523 
minutes 
early 
which 
gave UnrelEv_train
me 
plenty 
of 
time 
to 
get+on ScrEv_get_on
the 
train 
and 
enjoy UnrelEv_train
my 
trip 
. 
<end_of_story>_train 
last 
week 
my 
boss 
told UnrelEv_train
me 
that Evoking_train
i 
needed UnrelEv_train
to 
go RelNScrEv_train
to 
a 
meeting 
in 
new 
york 
. 
i 
decided UnrelEv_train
the 
best 
way 
to 
get RelNScrEv_train
to 
new 
york 
was 
to 
take+a+train Evoking_train
. 
i 
went ScrEv_get_tickets
online 
and 
bought ScrEv_get_tickets
a 
train 
ticket 
that 
would 
get RelNScrEv_train
me 
there 
well 
ahead 
of 
the 
meeting 
start 
time 
. 
on 
the 
day 
of 
the 
trip 
i 
went ScrEv_get_train_station
to 
the 
train 
station 
and 
stood ScrEv_wait
in 
line 
at 
the 
ticket 
counter 
. 
when 
i 
got RelNScrEv_train
to 
the 
front 
of 
the 
line 
i 
told ScrEv_get_tickets
the 
agent 
my 
name 
and 
they 
pulled+up ScrEv_get_tickets
my 
reservation 
on 
their 
computer 
and 
printed+out ScrEv_get_tickets
a 
paper 
ticket 
. 
i 
thanked RelNScrEv_train
them 
, 
took ScrEv_get_tickets
the 
ticket 
, 
and 
left RelNScrEv_train
the 
counter 
. 
once 
i 
left RelNScrEv_train
the 
counter 
i 
went ScrEv_get_platform
to 
the 
gate 
to 
wait ScrEv_wait
for 
my 
train 
to 
come ScrEv_train_arrives
. 
when 
my 
train 
arrived ScrEv_train_arrives
, 
everyone 
waiting ScrEv_wait
for 
that 
train 
lined+up RelNScrEv_train
and 
walked RelNScrEv_train
through 
the 
gate 
while 
the 
attendant 
checked ScrEv_conductor_checks
our 
tickets 
. 
once 
i 
walked RelNScrEv_train
through 
the 
gate 
, 
i 
went RelNScrEv_train
outside 
and 
boarded ScrEv_get_on
the 
train 
. 
thankfully 
i 
was 
able 
to 
sit ScrEv_find_place
alone 
, 
and 
i 
pulled+out ScrEv_spend_time_train
a 
magazine 
to 
read ScrEv_spend_time_train
. 
a 
little 
while 
after 
the 
train 
started UnrelEv_train
moving ScrEv_train_departs
the 
conductor 
walked RelNScrEv_train
through 
the 
train 
car 
to 
check ScrEv_conductor_checks
everyone 
's 
ticket 
. 
i 
handed ScrEv_conductor_checks
my 
ticket 
to 
the 
conductor 
and 
he 
scanned ScrEv_conductor_checks
it 
and 
handed ScrEv_conductor_checks
it 
back 
to 
me 
. 
now 
i 
could 
enjoy UnrelEv_train
my 
train+ride Evoking_train
and 
get UnrelEv_train
back 
to 
reading ScrEv_spend_time_train
my 
magazine 
. 
a 
little 
while 
later 
the 
conductor 
announced RelNScrEv_train
that 
the 
train 
had 
arrived ScrEv_train_arrives
in 
new 
york 
. 
the 
train 
came ScrEv_train_arrives
to 
a 
stop 
, 
and 
i 
got+off ScrEv_get_off
of 
the 
train 
along 
with 
everyone 
else 
. 
i 
was 
pleased UnrelEv_train
that 
i 
had UnrelEv_train
a 
pleasant 
train+ride Evoking_train
, 
and 
i 
walked RelNScrEv_train
quickly 
through 
the 
train 
station 
to 
go RelNScrEv_train
outside 
and 
catch 
a 
cab 
to 
get UnrelEv_train
to 
my 
meeting 
. 
<end_of_story>_train 
i 
recently 
needed UnrelEv_train
to 
go RelNScrEv_train
to 
a 
moderately 
distant 
city 
. 
because 
it 
is UnrelEv_train
on 
the 
other 
side 
of 
a 
local 
mountain 
range 
, 
travel 
in 
my 
car 
would 
be UnrelEv_train
very 
hard 
on 
it 
, 
and 
i 
might 
get UnrelEv_train
lost 
. 
fortunately 
there 
is UnrelEv_train
a 
passenger+train Evoking_train
that 
goes RelNScrEv_train
between 
out 
two 
cities 
. 
i 
had 
, 
before 
this 
trip 
, 
never 
been UnrelEv_train
on 
any 
kind 
of 
train 
bigger 
than 
one 
at 
the 
amusement 
park 
. 
i 
was 
very 
excited UnrelEv_train
for 
this 
opportunity 
. 
when 
i 
arrived ScrEv_get_train_station
at 
the 
station 
i 
was 
very 
pleased UnrelEv_train
to 
see UnrelEv_train
that 
the 
train 
had UnrelEv_train
large 
windows 
. 
while 
on 
the 
trip 
these 
proved UnrelEv_train
to 
be 
wonderful 
for 
all 
of 
the 
gorgeous 
views 
provided UnrelEv_train
by 
nature 
. 
as 
my 
trip 
was UnrelEv_train
a 
half 
day 
journey 
. 
i 
stopped RelNScrEv_train
in 
the 
dining 
car 
for 
lunch 
, 
i 
found UnrelEv_train
it 
highly 
enjoyable 
to 
eat ScrEv_spend_time_train
on 
the 
train 
, 
and 
this 
also 
helped UnrelEv_train
to 
distract UnrelEv_train
me 
from 
the 
time 
. 
when 
i 
arrived ScrEv_train_arrives
in 
the 
other 
city 
i 
met UnrelEv_train
a 
friend 
who 
was 
eager 
to 
learn UnrelEv_train
about 
my 
trip 
.

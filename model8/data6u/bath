'' 
after 
playing UnrelEv_bath
football 
with 
my 
friends 
, 
i 
was UnrelEv_bath
all 
sweaty 
and 
dirty 
, 
so 
i 
decide UnrelEv_bath
i 
should 
take+a+bath Evoking_bath
. 
first 
i 
made+sure UnrelEv_bath
there 
were UnrelEv_bath
clean 
towels 
available 
and 
enough 
soap 
and 
shampoo 
to 
thoroughly 
clean ScrEv_wash
my 
skin 
and 
hair 
. 
i 
put ScrEv_close_drain
the 
plug 
in 
the 
bottom 
of 
the 
bath 
tub 
and 
turned+on ScrEv_turn_water_on
the 
water 
, 
being UnrelEv_bath
careful 
to 
adjust ScrEv_check_temp
the 
water 
to 
a 
nice 
warm 
, 
but 
no 
too 
hot 
, 
temperature 
. 
i 
used UnrelEv_bath
my 
finger 
to 
determine ScrEv_check_temp
just 
the 
right 
temperature 
. 
after 
removing ScrEv_undress
my 
clothes 
and 
placing RelNScrEv_bath
them 
in 
the 
hamper 
, 
i 
carefully 
stepped ScrEv_sink_water
into 
the 
tub 
, 
being UnrelEv_bath
sure 
to 
steady UnrelEv_bath
myself 
as 
i 
entered ScrEv_sink_water
. 
i 
gingerly 
lowered ScrEv_sink_water
myself 
into 
the 
nice 
warm 
water 
and 
immediately 
began UnrelEv_bath
to 
relax ScrEv_relax
. 
after 
a 
few 
minutes 
of 
rest 
and 
relaxation 
, 
i 
got+out RelNScrEv_bath
the 
soap 
and 
thoroughly 
washed ScrEv_wash
my 
whole 
body 
, 
making+sure UnrelEv_bath
to 
get UnrelEv_bath
all 
of 
the 
dirt 
and 
grass 
stains 
off 
that 
i 
had 
accumulated UnrelEv_bath
from 
playing UnrelEv_bath
football 
. 
next 
i 
washed ScrEv_wash
my 
hair 
with 
shampoo 
and 
laid+back RelNScrEv_bath
into 
the 
water 
to 
really 
rinse RelNScrEv_bath
it 
out 
well 
. 
i 
carefully 
exited ScrEv_get_out_bath
the 
bath 
tub 
, 
making+sure UnrelEv_bath
to 
step RelNScrEv_bath
onto 
the 
bath 
mat 
so 
i 
would 
n't 
slip UnrelEv_bath
on 
the 
smooth 
floor 
tiles 
, 
and 
got RelNScrEv_bath
a 
towel 
and 
dried ScrEv_dry
myself 
off 
. 
now 
my 
bath 
was UnrelEv_bath
complete 
and 
i 
felt UnrelEv_bath
so 
nice 
and 
clean 
! 
what 
a 
great 
feeling 
! 
<end_of_story>_bath 
yesterday 
was UnrelEv_bath
a 
long 
and 
stressful 
day 
. 
from 
start 
to 
finish 
, 
it 
felt UnrelEv_bath
like 
nothing 
could 
possibly 
go UnrelEv_bath
right 
. 
on 
days 
like 
those 
, 
i 
really 
love UnrelEv_bath
a 
nice 
bubble 
bath 
to 
relax ScrEv_relax
and 
wash+off ScrEv_wash
the 
stress 
, 
so 
that 
is UnrelEv_bath
what 
i 
did UnrelEv_bath
. 
i 
gathered+up ScrEv_prepare_bath
a 
towel 
, 
body 
wash 
, 
shampoo 
, 
conditioner 
, 
bubble 
bath 
and 
a 
few 
candles 
and 
walked ScrEv_enter_bathroom
into 
my 
bathroom 
to 
take+a+nice+,+long+bath Evoking_bath
. 
i 
lit ScrEv_prepare_bath
the 
cinnamon-scented 
candles 
, 
turned+on ScrEv_turn_water_on
the 
water 
to 
make+sure UnrelEv_bath
it 
would 
be UnrelEv_bath
warm 
before 
i 
stepped+in ScrEv_sink_water
, 
then 
i 
dropped ScrEv_put_bubble_bath_scent
a 
little 
bit 
of 
the 
bubble 
bath 
in 
the 
water 
to 
create UnrelEv_bath
a 
gentle 
lather 
. 
i 
sank ScrEv_sink_water
into 
the 
bubbles 
and 
took UnrelEv_bath
a 
deep 
breath 
. 
it 
felt UnrelEv_bath
amazing 
to 
get UnrelEv_bath
to 
relax ScrEv_relax
after 
such 
a 
rough 
day 
. 
the 
candles 
made UnrelEv_bath
the 
whole 
bathroom 
smell UnrelEv_bath
great 
and 
the 
water 
was UnrelEv_bath
awesome 
on 
my 
skin 
. 
finally 
, 
i 
shampooed ScrEv_wash
my 
hair 
and 
washed ScrEv_wash
myself 
, 
then 
toweled+off ScrEv_dry
and 
put+on ScrEv_get_dressed
my 
pajamas 
to 
get+ready UnrelEv_bath
for 
bed 
. 
<end_of_story>_bath 
how 
you 
take+a+bath Evoking_bath
varies UnrelEv_bath
a 
bit 
with 
what 
type 
of 
bathing 
facilities 
you 
have UnrelEv_bath
. 
i 
'm 
going 
to 
describe UnrelEv_bath
the 
typical 
definition 
of 
a 
bath 
. 
go ScrEv_enter_bathroom
to 
your 
tub 
and 
take UnrelEv_bath
the 
shower 
curtain 
out 
of 
the 
tub 
if 
it 
is UnrelEv_bath
inside 
it 
. 
you 
do 
n't 
want 
it 
to 
get UnrelEv_bath
wet 
! 
before 
you 
close ScrEv_close_drain
the 
drain 
you 
should 
turn+on ScrEv_turn_water_on
the 
water 
and 
let UnrelEv_bath
it 
run RelNScrEv_bath
for 
a 
little 
bit 
so 
you 
can 
get RelNScrEv_bath
it 
to 
the 
right 
temperature 
before 
you 
start 
filling ScrEv_fill_water/wait
the 
tub 
. 
if 
you 
have UnrelEv_bath
somewhere 
to 
store UnrelEv_bath
the 
water 
you 
can 
place UnrelEv_bath
a 
bucket 
under 
the 
warming UnrelEv_bath
water 
and 
use UnrelEv_bath
it 
for 
another 
purpose 
. 
conservation 
! 
once 
the 
water 
coming UnrelEv_bath
from 
the 
tap 
is UnrelEv_bath
at 
the 
temperature 
you 
like UnrelEv_bath
you 
can 
place ScrEv_close_drain
the 
stopper 
in 
the 
drain 
and 
start UnrelEv_bath
filling ScrEv_fill_water/wait
the 
tub 
. 
make+sure UnrelEv_bath
you 
do 
n't 
fill ScrEv_fill_water/wait
the 
tub 
all 
the 
way 
to 
the 
top 
because 
the 
water 
will 
displace UnrelEv_bath
once 
you 
get ScrEv_sink_water
into 
the 
tub 
. 
you 
can 
also 
get+in ScrEv_sink_water
as 
the 
tub 
is 
filling ScrEv_fill_water/wait
so 
you 
can 
make UnrelEv_bath
a 
better 
judgment 
about 
when 
to 
turn+off ScrEv_turn_water_off
the 
water 
. 
while 
you 
are UnrelEv_bath
in 
the 
tub 
you 
should 
take RelNScrEv_bath
a 
wash 
cloth 
and 
soap 
or 
bodywash 
to 
give ScrEv_wash
yourself 
a 
good 
scrub 
down 
. 
if 
you 
need 
to 
wash ScrEv_wash
your 
hair 
it 
is UnrelEv_bath
often 
better 
to 
do UnrelEv_bath
it 
after 
your 
bath 
. 
you 
can 
put ScrEv_wash
the 
shampoo 
in 
your 
hair 
and 
as 
the 
tub 
empties RelNScrEv_bath
place UnrelEv_bath
your 
head 
under 
the 
faucet 
to 
rinse+out RelNScrEv_bath
the 
soap 
. 
enjoy UnrelEv_bath
your 
bath 
! 
, 
this 
one 
was UnrelEv_bath
a 
little 
tough 
. 
i 
was UnrelEv_bath
n't 
sure 
how 
much 
detail 
to 
go UnrelEv_bath
into 
about 
taking+the+bath Evoking_bath
versus 
setting+up ScrEv_prepare_bath
the 
bath 
<end_of_story>_bath 
it 
was UnrelEv_bath
a 
hard 
day 
, 
so 
i 
looked UnrelEv_bath
forward 
to 
making UnrelEv_bath
myself 
the 
perfect 
bath 
. 
i 
get UnrelEv_bath
home 
from 
work 
and 
head ScrEv_enter_bathroom
straight 
for 
the 
bathtub 
. 
i 
run RelNScrEv_bath
the 
water 
until 
it 
's UnrelEv_bath
the 
perfect 
temperature 
and 
plug ScrEv_close_drain
the 
drain 
to 
allow UnrelEv_bath
the 
water 
to 
fill ScrEv_fill_water/wait
the 
tub 
. 
i 
take ScrEv_put_bubble_bath_scent
some 
bath 
salts 
and 
oils 
to 
drizzle UnrelEv_bath
underneath 
the 
stream 
of 
water 
to 
allow UnrelEv_bath
it 
to 
dissolve UnrelEv_bath
and 
it 
fills UnrelEv_bath
the 
room 
with 
gentle 
fragrance 
. 
as 
the 
tub 
continues UnrelEv_bath
to 
fill ScrEv_fill_water/wait
with 
water 
, 
i 
grab ScrEv_prepare_bath
some 
candles 
and 
carefully 
place ScrEv_prepare_bath
them 
around 
the 
tub 
. 
after 
lighting ScrEv_prepare_bath
the 
candles 
and 
setting+up ScrEv_prepare_bath
a 
towel 
and 
robe 
for 
getting+out ScrEv_get_out_bath
, 
i 
put+on ScrEv_prepare_bath
some 
quiet 
music 
to 
drown+out UnrelEv_bath
the 
sound 
of 
my 
husband 
's 
hockey 
game 
. 
i 
grab ScrEv_prepare_bath
a 
small 
towel 
to 
use UnrelEv_bath
as 
a 
pillow 
for 
my 
neck 
and 
finally 
get ScrEv_sink_water
in 
the 
bath 
. 
i 
feel UnrelEv_bath
like 
i 
'm 
melting UnrelEv_bath
as 
i 
shut UnrelEv_bath
my 
eyes 
and 
allow UnrelEv_bath
myself 
to 
relax ScrEv_relax
. 
i 
do 
n't 
realize UnrelEv_bath
how 
long 
i 
'm UnrelEv_bath
in 
there 
until 
i 
open UnrelEv_bath
my 
eyes 
and 
see UnrelEv_bath
my 
husband 
standing UnrelEv_bath
over 
me 
. 
the 
water 
has 
lost RelNScrEv_bath
all 
its 
warmth 
. 
he 
had 
put UnrelEv_bath
the 
towel 
in 
the 
dryer 
and 
it 
was UnrelEv_bath
now 
warm 
, 
fluffy 
, 
and 
welcoming 
. 
i 
step+out ScrEv_get_out_bath
of 
the 
day 
as 
my 
troubles 
swirl UnrelEv_bath
down 
the 
drain 
. 
<end_of_story>_bath 
i 
like UnrelEv_bath
taking+a+bath Evoking_bath
instead 
of 
a 
shower 
sometimes 
. 
i 
start UnrelEv_bath
by 
closing ScrEv_close_drain
the 
drain 
at 
the 
bottom 
of 
the 
tub 
. 
some 
tubs 
have UnrelEv_bath
a 
stopper 
and 
some 
have UnrelEv_bath
a 
thing 
you 
push UnrelEv_bath
down 
to 
close ScrEv_close_drain
it 
. 
after 
it 
's UnrelEv_bath
closed ScrEv_close_drain
i 
like UnrelEv_bath
to 
run RelNScrEv_bath
both 
hot 
and 
cold 
water 
to 
make UnrelEv_bath
warm 
water 
and 
then 
i 
let UnrelEv_bath
the 
tub 
fill+up ScrEv_fill_water/wait
to 
about 
a 
hand 
's 
height 
from 
the 
top 
of 
the 
tub 
. 
while 
the 
water 
is 
running ScrEv_fill_water/wait
, 
i 
squirt+in ScrEv_put_bubble_bath_scent
bubbles 
and 
make+sure ScrEv_prepare_bath
i 
have UnrelEv_bath
a 
clean 
washcloth 
and 
towel 
. 
after 
i 
carefully 
climb ScrEv_sink_water
into 
the 
tub 
, 
i 
make+sure UnrelEv_bath
i 
wash ScrEv_wash
my 
whole 
body 
with 
the 
soap 
and 
washcloth 
, 
even 
behind 
my 
ears 
and 
between 
my 
toes 
. 
then 
i 
can 
either 
soak RelNScrEv_bath
and 
relax ScrEv_relax
in 
the 
tub 
or 
i 
can 
play RelNScrEv_bath
with 
toys 
. 
fun 
toys 
for 
the 
bathtub 
are UnrelEv_bath
boats 
and 
plastic 
water 
animals 
like 
whales 
and 
ducks 
. 
once 
the 
water 
starts UnrelEv_bath
to 
turn RelNScrEv_bath
a 
little 
cold 
, 
it 
's UnrelEv_bath
time 
to 
get+out ScrEv_get_out_bath
so 
i 
open ScrEv_open_drain
the 
drain 
again 
and 
let UnrelEv_bath
the 
water 
empty+out RelNScrEv_bath
. 
while 
it 
's 
draining RelNScrEv_bath
i 
carefully 
stand+up RelNScrEv_bath
and 
reach UnrelEv_bath
for 
my 
towel 
to 
dry+off ScrEv_dry
. 
i 
always 
be+sure RelNScrEv_bath
the 
tub 
is UnrelEv_bath
clean 
when 
i 
'm UnrelEv_bath
finished 
, 
with 
toys 
and 
the 
dirty 
washcloth 
put RelNScrEv_bath
where 
they 
belong UnrelEv_bath
. 
<end_of_story>_bath 
i 
prefer UnrelEv_bath
showers 
but 
sometimes 
you 
just 
need 
to 
take+a+bath Evoking_bath
. 
showers 
are UnrelEv_bath
good 
for 
when 
you 
are UnrelEv_bath
really 
dirty 
and 
need 
to 
get UnrelEv_bath
cleaned 
fast 
but 
baths 
are UnrelEv_bath
more 
leisurely 
and 
relaxing 
. 
first 
i 
go ScrEv_enter_bathroom
in 
the 
bathroom 
and 
put ScrEv_close_drain
a 
stopper 
in 
the 
bathtub 
to 
stop UnrelEv_bath
the 
water 
from 
running+out RelNScrEv_bath
. 
then 
i 
start ScrEv_turn_water_on
the 
water 
to 
fill+up ScrEv_fill_water/wait
the 
tub 
. 
i 
also 
make+sure ScrEv_check_temp
it 
is UnrelEv_bath
just 
right 
, 
not 
too 
hot 
or 
cold 
. 
then 
i 
get ScrEv_prepare_bath
my 
face 
cloth 
and 
a 
great 
big 
bar 
of 
soap 
. 
if 
i 
feel UnrelEv_bath
playful 
i 
will 
grab ScrEv_prepare_bath
a 
couple 
water 
toys 
to 
play RelNScrEv_bath
with 
. 
then 
i 
slip+-lrb-+off ScrEv_undress
my 
clothes 
and 
slip ScrEv_sink_water
into 
the 
tub 
. 
i 
fill ScrEv_fill_water/wait
the 
tub 
really 
high 
so 
only 
my 
head 
sticks+out UnrelEv_bath
above 
the 
water 
. 
i 
like UnrelEv_bath
the 
hot 
water 
all 
over 
me 
. 
i 
will 
spend UnrelEv_bath
an 
hour 
soaking RelNScrEv_bath
in 
the 
tub 
. 
i 
will 
sit ScrEv_relax
there 
till 
my 
fingers 
get UnrelEv_bath
all 
shrivelled 
and 
pruney 
. 
then 
i 
use UnrelEv_bath
my 
toes 
to 
take+out ScrEv_open_drain
the 
stopper 
and 
sit RelNScrEv_bath
there 
till 
the 
water 
all 
drains+away RelNScrEv_bath
. 
<end_of_story>_bath 
last 
night 
, 
i 
took+a+bath Evoking_bath
. 
i 
take+baths Evoking_bath
when 
i 
have UnrelEv_bath
time 
to 
relax ScrEv_relax
and 
soak RelNScrEv_bath
in 
bubbles 
. 
baths 
are UnrelEv_bath
important 
for 
good 
hygiene 
and 
self 
esteem 
. 
i 
always 
feel UnrelEv_bath
so 
much 
better 
when 
i 
am UnrelEv_bath
clean 
and 
smell UnrelEv_bath
like 
my 
favorite 
soap 
. 
i 
like UnrelEv_bath
to 
fill ScrEv_fill_water/wait
the 
tub 
up 
as 
full 
as 
i 
can UnrelEv_bath
and 
pick ScrEv_prepare_bath
a 
shower 
gel 
or 
bubble 
bath 
to 
make RelNScrEv_bath
lots 
and 
lots 
of 
bubbles 
. 
i 
just 
soak RelNScrEv_bath
in 
the 
bubbles 
and 
enjoy ScrEv_relax
the 
time 
to 
myself 
. 
then 
i 
wash ScrEv_wash
my 
hair 
with 
shampoo 
and 
conditioner 
. 
next 
, 
i 
make+sure UnrelEv_bath
to 
scrub ScrEv_wash
everywhere 
from 
between 
my 
toes 
to 
behind 
my 
ears 
with 
soap 
. 
after 
that 
, 
i 
am UnrelEv_bath
ready 
to 
dry+off ScrEv_dry
and 
get ScrEv_get_dressed
into 
some 
clean 
clothes 
. 
if 
i 
do 
n't 
have UnrelEv_bath
time 
for 
a 
bath 
, 
i 
just 
take UnrelEv_bath
a 
shower 
. 
showers 
are UnrelEv_bath
much 
faster 
! 
no 
matter 
what 
i 
choose UnrelEv_bath
, 
i 
make+sure UnrelEv_bath
to 
take+a+bath+or+a+shower Unclear_bath
every 
day 
. 
<end_of_story>_bath 
i 
went ScrEv_enter_bathroom
into 
my 
bathroom 
and 
started UnrelEv_bath
to 
run RelNScrEv_bath
the 
bath 
, 
letting UnrelEv_bath
the 
water 
get RelNScrEv_bath
warm 
enough 
. 
once 
warm 
, 
i 
plugged+up ScrEv_close_drain
the 
drain 
and 
the 
bath 
began UnrelEv_bath
to 
fill ScrEv_fill_water/wait
. 
i 
dripped ScrEv_put_bubble_bath_scent
some 
bubble 
bath 
into 
the 
water 
to 
get UnrelEv_bath
it 
nice 
and 
bubbly 
. 
suds 
filled ScrEv_fill_water/wait
the 
tub 
along 
with 
warm 
water 
, 
creating UnrelEv_bath
a 
heavenly 
scent 
. 
once 
the 
tub 
was UnrelEv_bath
filled 
, 
i 
disrobed ScrEv_undress
and 
got+in ScrEv_sink_water
. 
i 
sat ScrEv_relax
for 
a 
moment 
, 
relaxing ScrEv_relax
, 
allowing UnrelEv_bath
the 
warm 
water 
to 
sooth RelNScrEv_bath
my 
skin 
. 
after 
a 
few 
moments 
, 
i 
grabbed RelNScrEv_bath
a 
bar 
of 
soap 
and 
lathered ScrEv_wash
my 
body 
. 
i 
washed ScrEv_wash
myself 
carefully 
because 
i 
did 
not 
want 
to 
spill RelNScrEv_bath
water 
onto 
the 
floor 
. 
i 
washed ScrEv_wash
my 
hair 
and 
dunked RelNScrEv_bath
my 
head 
under 
water 
to 
clear RelNScrEv_bath
the 
shampoo 
and 
conditioner 
. 
after 
awhile 
the 
water 
began UnrelEv_bath
to 
cool RelNScrEv_bath
. 
since 
i 
was UnrelEv_bath
done 
washing ScrEv_wash
, 
i 
unplugged ScrEv_open_drain

. 
after

i 
rinse RelNScrEv_bath
the

<end_of_story>_bath 
i 
decided ScrEv_wash
to 
take+a+bath Evoking_bath
yesterday 
afternoon 
after 
working+out UnrelEv_bath
. 
once 
i 
got UnrelEv_bath
back 
home 
, 
i 
walked ScrEv_enter_bathroom
to 
my 
bathroom 
and 
first 
quickly 
scrubbed RelNScrEv_bath
the 
bathroom 
tub 
by 
turning+on ScrEv_turn_water_on
the 
water 
and 
rinsing RelNScrEv_bath
it 
clean 
with 
a 
rag 
. 
. 
after 
i 
finished UnrelEv_bath
, 
i 
plugged ScrEv_close_drain
the 
tub 
and 
began UnrelEv_bath
filling ScrEv_fill_water/wait
it 
with 
warm 
water 
set UnrelEv_bath
at 
about 
523 
degrees 
. 
while 
waiting ScrEv_fill_water/wait
for 
the 
tub 
to 
fill+up ScrEv_fill_water/wait
, 
i 
undressed ScrEv_undress
and 
closed RelNScrEv_bath
the 
bathroom 
door 
. 
about 
523 
minutes 
later 
, 
the 
tub 
was UnrelEv_bath
filled+up ScrEv_fill_water/wait
and 
i 
shut+off ScrEv_turn_water_off
the 
water 
. 
i 
briefly 
tested ScrEv_check_temp
the 
water 
with 
my 
elbow 
and 
then 
stepped ScrEv_sink_water
into 
the 
tub 
to 
lay+down ScrEv_sink_water
. 
for 
about 
523 
minutes 
, 
i 
lay ScrEv_relax
in 
the 
tub 
and 
relaxed ScrEv_relax
by 
closing UnrelEv_bath
my 
eyes 
. 
i 
had 
also 
took UnrelEv_bath
the 
time 
to 
read RelNScrEv_bath
pages 
of 
a 
book 
i 
had 
brought ScrEv_prepare_bath
with 
me 
. 
once 
my 
body 
was UnrelEv_bath
totally 
relaxed ScrEv_relax
, 
i 
took RelNScrEv_bath
a 
quick 
shower 
to 
rinse RelNScrEv_bath
myself 
off 
and 
then 
drained RelNScrEv_bath
the 
tub 
. 
next 
, 
i 
dried ScrEv_dry
myself 
off 
with 
a 
towel 
and 
put ScrEv_get_dressed
my 
clothes 
back 
on 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_bath
a 
great 
relaxing ScrEv_relax
experience 
after 
exercising UnrelEv_bath
in 
the 
cold 
winter 
day 
. 
<end_of_story>_bath 
i 
had UnrelEv_bath
a 
long 
day 
at 
work 
. 
i 
worked UnrelEv_bath
very 
hard 
and 
carried UnrelEv_bath
many 
boxes 
in 
the 
hot 
weather 
. 
my 
muscles 
were UnrelEv_bath
sore 
and 
i 
thought UnrelEv_bath
a 
hot 
bath 
was UnrelEv_bath
just 
what 
i 
needed UnrelEv_bath
! 
i 
got UnrelEv_bath
home 
and 
lit ScrEv_prepare_bath
a 
few 
candles 
. 
i 
turned+on ScrEv_turn_water_on
the 
hot 
water 
, 
closed ScrEv_close_drain
the 
drain 
in 
the 
bathtub 
and 
put ScrEv_put_bubble_bath_scent
some 
bubble 
bath 
in 
there 
. 
as 
the 
water 
rose ScrEv_fill_water/wait
and 
the 
bubbles 
grew UnrelEv_bath
, 
i 
got+out ScrEv_prepare_bath
my 
bath 
pillow 
and 
stuck UnrelEv_bath
the 
suction 
cups 
to 
the 
back 
of 
the 
tub 
. 
it 
floated UnrelEv_bath
on 
the 
water 
. 
i 
also 
got ScrEv_prepare_bath
my 
favorite 
book 
. 
i 
turned ScrEv_turn_water_off
the 
water 
off 
in 
the 
tub 
, 
put RelNScrEv_bath
one 
foot 
in 
at 
a 
time 
, 
then 
sank ScrEv_sink_water
into 
the 
hot 
water 
and 
bubbles 
. 
i 
washed ScrEv_wash
my 
face 
and 
laid+back ScrEv_relax
. 
i 
read RelNScrEv_bath
my 
book 
by 
candlelight 
and 
felt UnrelEv_bath
my 
aches 
melt+away UnrelEv_bath
into 
the 
hot 
water 
. 
when 
i 
was UnrelEv_bath
ready 
to 
get ScrEv_get_out_bath
out 
of 
the 
tub 
, 
i 
opened ScrEv_open_drain
the 
drain 
to 
let UnrelEv_bath
all 
the 
water 
run+out RelNScrEv_bath
. 
i 
felt UnrelEv_bath
a 
million 
times 
better 
! 
<end_of_story>_bath 
yesterday 
, 
i 
got UnrelEv_bath
ready 
to 
take+a+bath Evoking_bath
because 
i 
had UnrelEv_bath
a 
long 
stressful 
day 
. 
i 
started UnrelEv_bath
running ScrEv_fill_water/wait
the 
water 
and 
made+sure ScrEv_check_temp
it 
was UnrelEv_bath
just 
the 
right 
temperature 
. 
i 
did 
n't 
want UnrelEv_bath
the 
tub 
too 
hot 
or 
too 
cold 
. 
just 
perfect 
was UnrelEv_bath
what 
i 
needed UnrelEv_bath
. 
after 
getting UnrelEv_bath
the 
bath 
tub 
to 
the 
required UnrelEv_bath
temperature 
. 
i 
put ScrEv_put_bubble_bath_scent
some 
bubbles 
in 
it 
to 
make UnrelEv_bath
it 
extra 
fun 
! 
i 
hopped ScrEv_sink_water
in 
the 
bath 
tub 
and 
soaked RelNScrEv_bath
in 
it 
for 
quite 
some 
time 
while 
reading RelNScrEv_bath
a 
nice 
book 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_bath
a 
great 
relief 
to 
a 
very 
long 
day 
. 
i 
love UnrelEv_bath
taking+baths Evoking_bath
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
day 
to 
unwind UnrelEv_bath
. 
after 
a 
twenty 
minutes 
, 
or 
so 
, 
it 
was UnrelEv_bath
time 
to 
hop ScrEv_get_out_bath
out 
and 
get+dried+off ScrEv_dry
. 
i 
grabbed RelNScrEv_bath
my 
towel 
that 
was 
just 
recently 
washed UnrelEv_bath
, 
and 
dried ScrEv_dry
myself 
off 
. 
i 
felt UnrelEv_bath
a 
great 
deal 
of 
relief 
being UnrelEv_bath
nice 
and 
clean 
and 
ready 
to 
go UnrelEv_bath
for 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
night 
! 
<end_of_story>_bath 
last 
night 
, 
i 
decided UnrelEv_bath
to 
take+a+bath Evoking_bath
. 
i 
chose UnrelEv_bath
to 
take+a+bath Evoking_bath
because 
i 
find UnrelEv_bath
it 
to 
be UnrelEv_bath
more 
relaxing 
at 
bed 
time 
than 
taking UnrelEv_bath
a 
shower 
. 
i 
put UnrelEv_bath
my 
hair 
up 
in 
a 
bun 
so 
it 
would 
stay UnrelEv_bath
dry 
. 
i 
stuck ScrEv_close_drain
the 
stopper 
in 
the 
drain 
so 
the 
water 
would 
stay UnrelEv_bath
in 
the 
tub 
. 
i 
turned+on ScrEv_turn_water_on
the 
faucets 
and 
felt ScrEv_check_temp
the 
water 
until 
i 
had UnrelEv_bath
the 
right 
temperature 
. 
i 
made UnrelEv_bath
the 
bath 
a 
little 
hot 
so 
it 
would 
n't 
get RelNScrEv_bath
cold 
too 
fast 
. 
while 
the 
water 
was 
running ScrEv_fill_water/wait
, 
i 
took ScrEv_prepare_bath
the 
bottle 
of 
bubble 
bath 
out 
of 
the 
closet 
. 
i 
opened UnrelEv_bath
it 
up 
and 
squirted ScrEv_put_bubble_bath_scent
a 
little 
bit 
of 
bubble 
bath 
under 
the 
running ScrEv_fill_water/wait
water 
so 
the 
water 
would 
get UnrelEv_bath
nice 
and 
foamy 
. 
i 
then 
took+out ScrEv_prepare_bath
a 
fresh 
towel 
and 
a 
loofah 
sponge 
. 
i 
stepped RelNScrEv_bath
over 
the 
edge 
of 
the 
tub 
and 
sunk ScrEv_sink_water
into 
the 
water 
slowly 
. 
the 
hot 
water 
felt UnrelEv_bath
so 
good 
on 
my 
skin 
and 
i 
instantly 
felt UnrelEv_bath
relaxed ScrEv_relax
. 
i 
grabbed RelNScrEv_bath
a 
bar 
of 
soap 
and 
rubbed ScrEv_apply_soap
some 
on 
my 
loofah 
before 
scrubbing+down ScrEv_wash
. 
after 
a 
good 
scrub 
, 
i 
soaked RelNScrEv_bath
in 
the 
tub 
and 
relaxed ScrEv_relax
for 
a 
good 
twenty 
minutes 
. 
then 
i 
pulled ScrEv_open_drain
the 
stopper 
out 
of 
the 
tub 
and 
sat RelNScrEv_bath
there 
while 
the 
water 
went+down RelNScrEv_bath
. 
after 
the 
water 
was UnrelEv_bath
almost 
all 
gone 
, 
i 
very 
carefully 
stood+up ScrEv_get_out_bath
and 
blotted ScrEv_dry
myself 
dry 
with 
a 
towel 
. 
finally 
, 
i 
put+on ScrEv_get_dressed
my 
bathrobe 
and 
headed ScrEv_leave
to 
my 
room 
. 
<end_of_story>_bath 
this 
morning 
i 
decided UnrelEv_bath
to 
take+a+nice+,+long+bath Evoking_bath
rather 
than 
rushing UnrelEv_bath
through 
the 
shower 
. 
i 
walked+in ScrEv_enter_bathroom
and 
put ScrEv_close_drain
a 
stopper 
in 
the 
bathtub 
drain 
, 
turning+on ScrEv_turn_water_on
a 
mix 
of 
hot 
and 
cold 
water 
and 
checking ScrEv_check_temp
the 
temperature 
after 
a 
couple 
of 
seconds 
to 
make+sure ScrEv_check_temp
it 
was UnrelEv_bath
just 
right 
- 
i 
like UnrelEv_bath
my 
water 
a 
little 
bit 
hot 
, 
but 
not 
too 
hot 
! 
after 
sitting ScrEv_fill_water/wait
and 
waiting ScrEv_fill_water/wait
for 
several 
minutes 
for 
the 
bathtub 
to 
fill ScrEv_fill_water/wait
, 
i 
turned ScrEv_turn_water_off
it 
off 
and 
got+in ScrEv_sink_water
. 
after 
relaxing ScrEv_relax
for 
a 
few 
minutes 
, 
i 
grabbed RelNScrEv_bath
the 
body 
wash 
and 
rag 
i 
keep UnrelEv_bath
on 
the 
corner 
of 
the 
bathtub 
. 
i 
lathered ScrEv_apply_soap
it 
up 
and 
washed ScrEv_wash
my 
arms 
, 
my 
legs 
, 
my 
back 
, 
and 
my 
front 
, 
letting UnrelEv_bath
the 
water 
in 
the 
tub 
rinse+off RelNScrEv_bath
any 
soap 
when 
i 
was UnrelEv_bath
done 
with 
a 
part 
. 
after 
that 
, 
i 
pulled ScrEv_open_drain
the 
stopper 
and 
drained RelNScrEv_bath
the 
tub 
, 
used UnrelEv_bath
the 
towel 
hanging UnrelEv_bath
in 
the 
bathroom 
to 
dry ScrEv_dry
myself 
off 
, 
and 
put+on ScrEv_get_dressed
a 
fresh 
, 
clean 
pair 
of 
clothes 
. 
<end_of_story>_bath 
last 
night 
i 
took+a+bath Evoking_bath
. 
first 
, 
i 
plugged ScrEv_close_drain
the 
bath 
drain 
. 
then 
, 
i 
filled ScrEv_fill_water/wait
the 
bathtub 
with 
warm 
water 
. 
i 
poured ScrEv_put_bubble_bath_scent
some 
bubble 
bath 
mixture 
into 
the 
tub 
while 
the 
bath 
was 
filling ScrEv_fill_water/wait
so 
that 
my 
bath 
would 
have UnrelEv_bath
bubbles 
. 
. 
i 
then 
got+undressed ScrEv_undress
. 
when 
the 
bath 
was UnrelEv_bath
full 
, 
i 
turned+off ScrEv_turn_water_off
the 
water 
and 
climbed ScrEv_sink_water
into 
the 
warm 
tub 
. 
i 
felt UnrelEv_bath
very 
relaxed ScrEv_relax
as 
i 
lay ScrEv_relax
in 
the 
warm 
bubble 
bath 
. 
i 
shut UnrelEv_bath
my 
eyes 
for 
a 
moment 
to 
enjoy UnrelEv_bath
the 
sensation 
. 
i 
then 
washed ScrEv_wash
my 
hair 
, 
lathering ScrEv_wash
the 
shampoo 
into 
my 
hair 
, 
then 
rinsing RelNScrEv_bath
it 
off 
in 
the 
bath 
water 
. 
next 
, 
i 
washed ScrEv_wash
my 
whole 
body 
with 
a 
bar 
of 
soap 
. 
when 
i 
was UnrelEv_bath
completely 
clean 
, 
i 
stepped ScrEv_get_out_bath
out 
of 
the 
bath 
and 
wrapped RelNScrEv_bath
a 
towel 
around 
myself 
. 
i 
wrapped RelNScrEv_bath
a 
second 
towel 
around 
my 
hair 
to 
keep UnrelEv_bath
it 
from 
dripping UnrelEv_bath
everywhere 
. 
i 
then 
unplugged ScrEv_open_drain
the 
bath 
drain 
to 
let UnrelEv_bath
the 
water 
drain RelNScrEv_bath
out 
of 
the 
tub 
. 
<end_of_story>_bath 
after 
a 
long 
day 
at 
work 
and 
then 
the 
gym 
, 
i 
knew UnrelEv_bath
that 
a 
shower 
would 
not 
suffice UnrelEv_bath
. 
i 
needed UnrelEv_bath
a 
bath 
- 
a 
long 
, 
refreshing 
, 
bubbly 
bath 
with 
the 
radio 
blasting UnrelEv_bath
my 
favorite 
songs 
. 
i 
grabbed ScrEv_prepare_bath
a 
towel 
, 
a 
luffa 
, 
and 
my 
radio 
and 
headed ScrEv_enter_bathroom
to 
the 
bathroom 
. 
i 
sighed UnrelEv_bath
in 
relief 
as 
i 
eyed UnrelEv_bath
the 
bathtub 
. 
i 
whistled UnrelEv_bath
a 
tune 
as 
i 
turned ScrEv_turn_water_on
the 
hot 
water 
on 
and 
poured ScrEv_put_bubble_bath_scent
some 
of 
the 
bubble 
bath 
mix 
that 
i 
had UnrelEv_bath
. 
the 
bubbles 
quickly 
covered UnrelEv_bath
the 
water 
as 
i 
happily 
took+off ScrEv_undress
my 
clothes 
and 
dove ScrEv_sink_water
right 
in 
! 
i 
grabbed RelNScrEv_bath
my 
rubber 
ducky 
that 
was 
sitting UnrelEv_bath
on 
the 
edge 
of 
the 
tub 
and 
moved UnrelEv_bath
it 
into 
the 
water 
with 
me 
. 
as 
i 
listened RelNScrEv_bath
to 
the 
radio 
, 
i 
scrubbed ScrEv_wash
and 
washed ScrEv_wash
myself 
thoroughly 
, 
taking UnrelEv_bath
my 
time 
. 
i 
turned ScrEv_turn_water_off
the 
water 
off 
and 
continued UnrelEv_bath
bathing Unclear_bath
until 
my 
skin 
began UnrelEv_bath
to 
get UnrelEv_bath
all 
pruney 
. 
i 
hopped ScrEv_get_out_bath
out 
of 
the 
tub 
and 
toweled+off ScrEv_dry
so 
that 
i 
was UnrelEv_bath
as 
clean 
and 
dry 
as 
a 
whistle 
. 
i 
turned UnrelEv_bath
my 
radio 
off 
and 
walked ScrEv_leave
out 
of 
the 
bathroom 
with 
a 
big 
smile 
on 
my 
face 
. 
<end_of_story>_bath 
taking+a+bath Evoking_bath
can 
be UnrelEv_bath
a 
very 
relaxing 
thing 
to 
do UnrelEv_bath
especially 
right 
before 
bed 
. 
you 
can 
take+a+bath Evoking_bath
to 
clean ScrEv_wash
yourself 
or 
just 
to 
soak RelNScrEv_bath

relax ScrEv_relax
but 
both 
can 
be UnrelEv_bath
an 
enjoyable 
experience 
. 
get ScrEv_prepare_bath
your 
needed 
items 
together 
first 
. 
this 
will 
include UnrelEv_bath
a 
towel 
for 
drying+off ScrEv_dry
and 
any

such 
as

you 
may

to

a

off 
first 
so 
that 
your 
bath 
water 
stays UnrelEv_bath
clean 
as 
you 
soak RelNScrEv_bath
. 
you 
will 
want 
to 
make+sure RelNScrEv_bath
the 
tub 
is UnrelEv_bath
clean 
first 
and 
you 
might 
want 
to 
wipe RelNScrEv_bath
the 
bottom 
and 
sides 
off 
. 
when 
you 
are UnrelEv_bath
ready 
for 
your 
bath 
you 
want UnrelEv_bath
to 
first 
fill ScrEv_fill_water/wait
your 
tub 
with 
water 
using UnrelEv_bath
a 
temperature 
you 
find UnrelEv_bath
pleasant 
but 
make+sure UnrelEv_bath
you 
have 
put ScrEv_close_drain
the 
plug 
in 
so 
your 
water 
does 
not 
drain+away RelNScrEv_bath
. 
its 
nice 
to 
use ScrEv_put_bubble_bath_scent
bubble 
bath 
, 
or 
bath 
salts 
, 
or 
even 
bath 
oils 
. 
when 
taking+a+bath Evoking_bath
setting ScrEv_prepare_bath
a 
relaxing ScrEv_relax
atmosphere 
is 
also 
nice 
. 
you 
can 
turn+on ScrEv_prepare_bath
some 
soothing ScrEv_relax
music 
. 
candle 
in 
the 
room 
and 
around 
the 
tub 
are UnrelEv_bath
always 
nice 
too 
. 
<end_of_story>_bath 
we 
had 
just 
come UnrelEv_bath
home 
from 
the 
beach 
one 
saturday 
afternoon 
. 
we 
had UnrelEv_bath
a 
great 
time 
, 
but 
were UnrelEv_bath
very 
sweaty 
, 
sandy 
and 
sticky 
with 
old 
sunscreen 
, 
sweat 
and 
salt 
from 
the 
ocean 
. 
after 
unpacking UnrelEv_bath
the 
car 
, 
i 
had 
to 
take+a+bath Evoking_bath
. 
i 
love UnrelEv_bath
our 
deep 
soaking 
tub 
. 
i 
put+in ScrEv_close_drain
the 
drain 
plug 
and 
started UnrelEv_bath
running ScrEv_fill_water/wait
the 
water 
, 
making+sure ScrEv_check_temp
the 
temperature 
of 
the 
water 
was UnrelEv_bath
just 
right 
, 
and 
put+in ScrEv_put_bubble_bath_scent
my 
favorite 
bath 
scents 
and 
soap 
. 
when 
the 
tub 
was UnrelEv_bath
full 
, 
i 
immersed ScrEv_sink_water
myself 
deep 
into 
the 
tub 
and 
just 
let UnrelEv_bath
my 
body 
soak RelNScrEv_bath
for 
a 
while 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_bath
good 
to 
sit ScrEv_relax
in 
the 
nice 
, 
warm 
water 
and 
let UnrelEv_bath
everything 
just 
relax ScrEv_relax
and 
melt+away UnrelEv_bath
from 
me 
. 
i 
washed ScrEv_wash
my 
hair 
with 
my 
favorite 
shampoo 
, 
as 
i 
had UnrelEv_bath
a 
lot 
of 
sand 
in 
it 
from 
playing UnrelEv_bath
at 
the 
beach 
that 
day 
. 
i 
scrubbed ScrEv_wash
my 
body 
well 
with 
a 
washcloth 
, 
to 
get+off UnrelEv_bath
all 
the 
sand 
and 
ocean 
salt 
that 
had 
dried UnrelEv_bath
on 
my 
skin 
, 
along 
with 
the 
sunscreen 
that 
i 
had 
been 
using UnrelEv_bath
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_bath
very 
relaxing 
and 
i 
felt UnrelEv_bath
really 
good 
. 
i 
then 
pulled ScrEv_open_drain
the 
drain 
on 
the 
tub 
and 
let UnrelEv_bath
all 
the 
dirty 
water 
go+down RelNScrEv_bath
. 
i 
had UnrelEv_bath
a 
big 
, 
fluffy 
bath 
towel 
that 
i 
dried+off ScrEv_dry
in 
, 
and 
i 
put+on ScrEv_get_dressed
clean 
clothes 
. 
i 
was UnrelEv_bath
ready 
to 
finish+up UnrelEv_bath
our 
fun 
day 
with 
some 
dinner 
and 
good 
times 
with 
my 
family 
. 
<end_of_story>_bath 
i 
take UnrelEv_bath
showers 
in 
the 
morning 
, 
but 
i 
enjoy UnrelEv_bath
taking+a+bath Evoking_bath
in 
the 
evening 
. 
i 
find UnrelEv_bath
it 
relaxes ScrEv_relax
me 
and 
helps UnrelEv_bath
me 
to 
sleep UnrelEv_bath
better 
. 
i 
have UnrelEv_bath
a 
bottle 
of 
pink 
bubble 
bath 
that 
i 
like UnrelEv_bath
to 
use ScrEv_put_bubble_bath_scent
when 
i 
bathe Evoking_bath
. 
i 
begin UnrelEv_bath
by 
making+sure UnrelEv_bath
the 
water 
will 
stay UnrelEv_bath
in 
the 
tub 
, 
by 
flipping+up ScrEv_close_drain
the 
lever 
below 
the 
faucet 
. 
it 
prevents UnrelEv_bath
the 
water 
from 
going RelNScrEv_bath
down 
the 
drain 
. 
then 
i 
turn+on ScrEv_turn_water_on
the 
hot 
and 
cold 
water 
until 
it 
comes+out UnrelEv_bath
of 
the 
faucet 
at 
a 
temperature 
i 
like UnrelEv_bath
, 
then 
make UnrelEv_bath
the 
water 
a 
little 
bit 
hotter 
because 
it 
usually 
cools+down RelNScrEv_bath
as 
the 
tub 
is 
filling ScrEv_fill_water/wait
. 
while 
the 
water 
is 
running ScrEv_fill_water/wait
, 
i 
add ScrEv_put_bubble_bath_scent
some 
of 
my 
bubble 
bath 
directly 
under 
the 
stream 
of 
water 
. 
it 
immediately 
starts UnrelEv_bath
to 
foam RelNScrEv_bath
and 
bubble RelNScrEv_bath
, 
and 
fills UnrelEv_bath
the 
bathroom 
with 
a 
wonderful 
fragrance 
. 
when 
the 
tub 
is 
filled ScrEv_fill_water/wait
almost 
to 
the

, 
i 
get+undressed ScrEv_undress

the

rises ScrEv_fill_water/wait
around 
me 
as 
i 
sink ScrEv_sink_water
under 
the 
water 
and 
i 
am 
surrounded UnrelEv_bath

foamy 
bubbles

i 
lean RelNScrEv_bath
my

back 
against

it 
feels UnrelEv_bath
wonderful

i 
soak RelNScrEv_bath

, 
then 
take RelNScrEv_bath
a

it

i 
rub ScrEv_apply_soap
the

my

i 
soak RelNScrEv_bath
for 
a

longer 
until 
the 
water 
starts UnrelEv_bath
to 
get RelNScrEv_bath
uncomfortably 
cool 
. 
i 
flip ScrEv_open_drain
the 
lever 
and 
the 
water 
begins UnrelEv_bath
to 
go RelNScrEv_bath
down 
the 
drain 
. 
i 
'm

so 
i 
stand+up RelNScrEv_bath

turn+on RelNScrEv_bath
the

them

i

a

<end_of_story>_bath

on 
monday 
evening 
,

i 
started UnrelEv_bath
running ScrEv_fill_water/wait
the 
water 
in 
the 
tub 
while 
i 
gathered ScrEv_prepare_bath
a

items

first 
i 
placed ScrEv_prepare_bath
candles 
around 
the 
edge 
of 
the 
tub 
and 
lit ScrEv_prepare_bath
them 
for 
ambience 
. 
then 
i 
put ScrEv_put_bubble_bath_scent
in 
some 
bath 
salts 
to 
make UnrelEv_bath
the 
water 
scented 
and 
smooth 
. 
i 
put ScrEv_prepare_bath
some 
towels 
near 
the 
edge 
of 
the 
tub 
so 
they 
would 
be UnrelEv_bath
ready 
when 
i 
got+out ScrEv_get_out_bath
. 
then 
i 
slid ScrEv_sink_water
into 
the 
water 
and 
enjoyed ScrEv_relax
the 
relaxing ScrEv_relax
warmth 
for 
twenty 
or 
thirty 
minutes 
. 
when 
it 
was UnrelEv_bath
time

i 
started UnrelEv_bath
letting RelNScrEv_bath

i 
changed RelNScrEv_bath
out 
of 
my 
clothes 
into 
a 
plush 
bathrobe 
. 
i 
placed ScrEv_close_drain
a

in 
the

the

could 
fill+up ScrEv_fill_water/wait

i 
turned+on ScrEv_turn_water_on
the

i 
sprinkled+in ScrEv_put_bubble_bath_scent
some 
lavender 
scented UnrelEv_bath
bath 
salts 
to 
make UnrelEv_bath
it 
extra 
relaxing ScrEv_relax

it 
took UnrelEv_bath
about 
five 
minutes 
for 
the 
whole

i 
did 
n't

i 
had 
to 
leave UnrelEv_bath

hot 
water 
to 
calm ScrEv_relax
my

down 
and 
help UnrelEv_bath
me 
relax ScrEv_relax
. 
i 
put ScrEv_wash
shampoo 
on 
my 
hair 
and 
washed ScrEv_wash
my 
hair 
and 
massaged RelNScrEv_bath
my 
scalp 
. 
i 
then 
placed ScrEv_wash
conditioner 
on 
my 
hair 
and 
lathered ScrEv_wash
it 
all 
over 
my 
hair 
. 
i 
then 
washed RelNScrEv_bath
it 
off 
and 
focused UnrelEv_bath
on 
washing ScrEv_wash
my 
body 
. 
after 
washing ScrEv_wash
my 
body 
, 
and 
rinsing+off RelNScrEv_bath
the 
soap 
suds 
, 
i 
simply 
let UnrelEv_bath
the 
hot 
water 
go UnrelEv_bath
all 
over 
my 
body 
and 
allowed UnrelEv_bath
it 
to 
help UnrelEv_bath
me 
relax ScrEv_relax
. 
<end_of_story>_bath 
first 
i 
run 
plug ScrEv_close_drain
the 
bath 
and 
run ScrEv_fill_water/wait
the 
hot 
water 
. 
then 
i 
take+off ScrEv_undress
my 
jacket 
and 
socks 
. 
next 
i 
take+off ScrEv_undress
my 
shirt 
and 
pants 
. 
finally 
i 
take+off ScrEv_undress
my 
underwear 
. 
i 
am UnrelEv_bath
completely 
naked 
. 
one 
the 
bath 
is UnrelEv_bath
full 
i 
enter ScrEv_sink_water
it 
. 
usually 
it 
is UnrelEv_bath
a 
bit 
hot 
for 
me 
at 
first 
so 
i 
go+in ScrEv_sink_water
slowly 
. 
once 
i 
'm UnrelEv_bath
in 
i 
lie+down ScrEv_relax
and 
think UnrelEv_bath
about 
what 
happened UnrelEv_bath
to 
me 
during 
the 
day 
, 
the 
things 
i 
did UnrelEv_bath
, 
and 
what 
i 
plan UnrelEv_bath
on 
doing UnrelEv_bath
tomorrow 
. 
then 
i 
soap ScrEv_wash
myself 
up 
, 
scrub ScrEv_wash
myself 
down 
and 
make+sure UnrelEv_bath
that 
i 
am UnrelEv_bath
nice 
and 
clean 
. 
when 
i 
get+out ScrEv_get_out_bath
i 
use UnrelEv_bath
that 
shower 
to 
rinse RelNScrEv_bath
myself 
off 
and 
drain RelNScrEv_bath
the 
bathwater 
. 
then 
i 
grab RelNScrEv_bath
a 
towel 
and 
use UnrelEv_bath
it 
to 
dry ScrEv_dry
the 
water 
off 
of 
my 
body 
. 
taking+a+bath Evoking_bath
is UnrelEv_bath
one 
of 
the 
most 
relaxing 
moments 
of 
my 
day 
. 
i 
enjoy UnrelEv_bath
it 
a 
lot 
. 
<end_of_story>_bath 
as 
i 
was 
getting UnrelEv_bath
ready 
for 
bed 
last 
night 
, 
i 
took+a+bath Evoking_bath
. 
i 
took+off ScrEv_undress
my 
clothes 
, 
then 
turned+on ScrEv_turn_water_on
the 
water 
in 
the 
tub 
. 
i 
made+sure ScrEv_check_temp
it 
was UnrelEv_bath
n't 
hot 
enough 
to 
hurt UnrelEv_bath
me 
, 
and 
warm 
enough 
to 
be UnrelEv_bath
comfortable 
. 
once 
i 
had UnrelEv_bath
it 
set UnrelEv_bath
, 
i 
plugged+up ScrEv_close_drain
the 
drain 
and 
let UnrelEv_bath
the 
tub 
fill+up ScrEv_fill_water/wait
with 
water 
. 
i 
saw UnrelEv_bath
there 
was UnrelEv_bath
enough 
water 
, 
so 
i 
turned ScrEv_turn_water_off
it 
off 
and 
got ScrEv_sink_water
in 
the 
tub 
. 
i 
took RelNScrEv_bath
the 
bottle 
of 
shampoo 
and 
put ScrEv_wash
some 
in 
my 
hair 
. 
as 
i 
scrubbed ScrEv_wash
my 
hair 
, 
there 
were UnrelEv_bath
lots 
of 
suds 
. 
i 
rinsed RelNScrEv_bath
my 
hair 
real 
well 
, 
then 
took RelNScrEv_bath
the 
bar 
of 
soap 
and 
started UnrelEv_bath
washing ScrEv_wash
my 
body 
. 
i 
made+sure UnrelEv_bath
to 
get ScrEv_wash
the 
soap 
all 
over 
me 
, 
then 
rinsed RelNScrEv_bath
it 
off 
afterwards 
. 
i 
got ScrEv_get_out_bath
out 
of 
the 
tub 
and 
pulled ScrEv_open_drain
the 
plug 
, 
watching UnrelEv_bath
all 
the 
soapy 
water 
go RelNScrEv_bath
down 
the 
drain 
. 
i 
grabbed RelNScrEv_bath
the 
towel 
i 
had 
set+out ScrEv_prepare_bath
earlier 
, 
and 
dried ScrEv_dry
myself 
off 
. 
i 
put+on ScrEv_get_dressed
my 
night 
clothes 
and 
hopped UnrelEv_bath
in 
bed 
for 
the 
night 
. 
<end_of_story>_bath 
i 
was 
sitting UnrelEv_bath
on 
my 
couch 
when 
i 
decided UnrelEv_bath
that 
i 
had 
n't 
taken+a+bath Evoking_bath
in 
a 
while 
so 
i 
stood+up UnrelEv_bath
and 
walked ScrEv_enter_bathroom
to 
the 
bathroom 
where 
i 
turned+on ScrEv_turn_water_on
the 
faucet 
in 
the 
sink 
and 
began UnrelEv_bath
filling ScrEv_fill_water/wait
the 
bath 
with 
hot 
water 
. 
while 
the 
tub 
was 
filling ScrEv_fill_water/wait
with 
hot 
water 
i 
put ScrEv_put_bubble_bath_scent
some 
bubble 
bath 
into 
the 
stream 
of 
hot 
water 
coming+out ScrEv_fill_water/wait
of 
the 
faucet 
so 
that 
the 
tubbed 
filled ScrEv_fill_water/wait
with 
not 
only 
hot 
water 
, 
but 
bubbles 
. 
once 
the 
tub 
was UnrelEv_bath
almost 
to 
the 
top 
i 
turned+off ScrEv_turn_water_off
the 
water 
so 
that 
none 
of 
the 
water 
would 
overflow RelNScrEv_bath
onto 
the 
bathroom 
floor 
. 
i 
got 
undressed ScrEv_undress
and 
entered ScrEv_sink_water
the 
tub 
, 
making+sure ScrEv_check_temp
that 
it 
's UnrelEv_bath
not 
very 
hot 
. 
i 
relax ScrEv_relax
in 
the 
tub 
until 
i 
am UnrelEv_bath
happy 
with 
my 
bath 
and 
then 
i 
get+out ScrEv_get_out_bath
and 
dry+off ScrEv_dry
with 
a 
towel 
and 
then 
get UnrelEv_bath
dressed ScrEv_get_dressed
and 
laid+down RelNScrEv_bath
in 
my 
bed 
and 
took RelNScrEv_bath
a 
nap 
, 
feeling UnrelEv_bath
very 
relaxed ScrEv_relax
, 
content 
, 
and 
happy 
. 
<end_of_story>_bath 
it 
's 
been UnrelEv_bath
a 
while 
since 
i 
have 
taken+a+bath Evoking_bath
, 
i 
usually 
shower RelNScrEv_bath
. 
when 
i 
do 
bathe Evoking_bath
, 
i 
tend UnrelEv_bath
to 
make UnrelEv_bath
a 
big 
deal 
of 
it 
, 
with 
bubble 
bath 
or 
bath 
oil 
, 
and 
book 
to 
read ScrEv_relax
in 
the 
tub 
, 
and 
very 
hot 
water 
. 
some 
bubble 
bath 
comes UnrelEv_bath
in 
carnation 
fragrance 
, 
and 
sometimes 
i 
have UnrelEv_bath
a 
packet 
in 
one 
of 
the 
bathroom 
drawers 
. 
if 
i 
have UnrelEv_bath
one 
, 
i 
put+in ScrEv_close_drain
the 
bathtub 
plug 
and 
open ScrEv_put_bubble_bath_scent
the 
packet 
and 
empty ScrEv_put_bubble_bath_scent
it 
under 
the 
bath 
tap 
. 
i 
turn+on ScrEv_turn_water_on
only 
the 
hot 
water 
, 
because 
at 
my 
house 
it 
starts UnrelEv_bath
out 
cold 
and 
only 
gradually 
heats+up UnrelEv_bath
. 
i 
do 
test ScrEv_check_temp
the 
temperature 
on 
my 
arm 
and 
adjust ScrEv_check_temp
it 
as 
the 
tub 
fills ScrEv_fill_water/wait
. 
i 
get ScrEv_take_clean_clothes
fresh 
clothes 
and 
put ScrEv_take_clean_clothes
them 
on 
the 
counter 
. 
i 
also 
get ScrEv_prepare_bath
an 
old 
paperback 
book 
, 
and 
put ScrEv_prepare_bath
it 
by 
the 
tub 
. 
finally 
i 
undress ScrEv_undress
, 
and 
usually 
put RelNScrEv_bath
the 
clothes 
i 
'm 
taking+off ScrEv_undress
in 
the 
hamper 
. 
i 
do UnrelEv_bath
all 
this 
rather 
slowly 
, 
because 
the 
tub 
fills ScrEv_fill_water/wait
so 
slowly 
. 
i 
climb+in ScrEv_sink_water
carefully 
, 
and 
again 
slowly 
, 
because 
the 
water 
is UnrelEv_bath
so 
hot 
. 
i 
slither+down ScrEv_sink_water
in 
the 
tub 
, 
so 
i 
am 
buried RelNScrEv_bath
in 
suds 
. 
then 
i 
pick+up RelNScrEv_bath
my 
book 
and 
start UnrelEv_bath
to 
read ScrEv_relax
. 
chances 
are UnrelEv_bath
, 
unless 
i 
'm UnrelEv_bath
really 
grubby 
i 
wont 
scrub ScrEv_wash
until 
the 
bubbles 
start UnrelEv_bath
to 
diminish UnrelEv_bath
, 
if 
then 
. 
i 
just 
let UnrelEv_bath
the 
heat 
soak ScrEv_relax
into 
me 
. 
finally 
i 
wash ScrEv_wash
, 
emphasizing UnrelEv_bath
body 
folds 
, 
using RelNScrEv_bath
just 
bar 
soap 
, 
no 
washcloth 
. 
i 
drain ScrEv_open_drain
the 
bath 
tub 
and 
stand+up ScrEv_get_out_bath
, 
and 
sometimes 
i 
'll 
shower RelNScrEv_bath
quickly 
to 
refresh UnrelEv_bath
myself 
, 
because 
i 
'm 
so 
relaxed ScrEv_relax
i 
could 
fall UnrelEv_bath
asleep 
where 
i 
stand UnrelEv_bath
. 
i 
climb ScrEv_get_out_bath
onto 
the 
mat 
and 
get UnrelEv_bath
dressed ScrEv_get_dressed
, 
usually 
ready 
for 
bed 
. 
<end_of_story>_bath 
i 
needed+a+bath Evoking_bath
. 
i 
turned+on ScrEv_turn_water_on
the 
cold 
and 
hot 
taps 
to 
let UnrelEv_bath
the 
bathtub 
fill ScrEv_fill_water/wait
with 
warm 
water 
. 
then 
i 
got ScrEv_prepare_bath
a 
towel 
and 
draped ScrEv_prepare_bath
it 
over 
the 
curtain 
rod 
. 
i 
took+off ScrEv_undress
my 
clothes 
and 
grabbed ScrEv_prepare_bath
my 
favorite 
rubber 
ducky 
from 
a 
shelf 
. 
i 
dropped ScrEv_prepare_bath
him 
into 
the 
tub 
. 
if 
i 
needed RelNScrEv_bath
a 
bath 
, 
so 
did UnrelEv_bath
he 
. 
i 
also 
poured ScrEv_put_bubble_bath_scent
some 
bubble 
bath 
into 
the 
tub 
as 
it 
was 
filling ScrEv_fill_water/wait
with 
water 
. 
it 
foamed+up RelNScrEv_bath
into 
lots 
of 
bubbles 
. 
when 
the 
tub 
was UnrelEv_bath
full 
enough 
, 
i 
turned+off ScrEv_turn_water_off
the 
water 
and 
got ScrEv_sink_water
into 
the 
tub 
, 
being UnrelEv_bath
careful 
not 
to 
slip RelNScrEv_bath
on 
the 
slippery 
porcelain 
. 
i 
lay+back ScrEv_relax
in 
the 
warm 
water 
and 
shut ScrEv_relax
my 
eyes 
, 
relaxing ScrEv_relax
. 
when 
the 
water 
started UnrelEv_bath
to 
get RelNScrEv_bath
cold 
, 
i 
stood+up ScrEv_get_out_bath
and 
grabbed ScrEv_get_towel
the 
towel 
from 
the 
curtain 
rod 
. 
i 
draped ScrEv_dry
it 
around 
myself 
and 
then 
opened ScrEv_open_drain
the 
tub 
's 
drain 
so 
the 
water 
could 
drain+out RelNScrEv_bath
. 
i 
went+off ScrEv_leave
to 
get 
dressed ScrEv_get_dressed
, 
and 
when 
i 
was 
done 
i 
went+back RelNScrEv_bath
to 
the 
bathroom 
and 
turned RelNScrEv_bath
the 
shower 
on 
for 
a 
minute 
so 
the 
bubbles 
would 
all 
go+down RelNScrEv_bath
the 
drain 
. 
i 
picked+up RelNScrEv_bath
my 
rubber 
ducky 
and 
gave UnrelEv_bath
him 
a 
squeeze 
until 
he 
quacked UnrelEv_bath
. 
then 
i 
put RelNScrEv_bath
him 
on 
the 
shelf 
until 
next 
time 
. 
<end_of_story>_bath 
after 
a 
long 
day 
of 
work 
i 
decided UnrelEv_bath
to 
take+a+bath Evoking_bath
. 
first 
i 
put+on ScrEv_prepare_bath
some 
good 
relaxing ScrEv_relax
acoustic 
music 
to 
listen RelNScrEv_bath
to 
while 
i 
took+the+bath Evoking_bath
. 
then 
i 
got ScrEv_check_temp
the 
water 
nice 
and 
hot 
and 
then 
stopped ScrEv_close_drain
the 
drain 
. 
after 
the 
tub 
was Unclear_bath
full 
i 
added ScrEv_put_bubble_bath_scent
lavender 
bubbles 
. 
i 
got ScrEv_prepare_bath
a 
tray 
to 
place ScrEv_prepare_bath
across 
the 
bath 
with 
my 
wine 
and 
a 
magazine 
and 
some 
chocolate 
. 
i 
sank ScrEv_sink_water
into 
the 
water 
and 
sighed ScrEv_relax
with 
relief 
. 
i 
drank RelNScrEv_bath
three 
glasses 
of 
wine 
and 
haphazardly 
paged RelNScrEv_bath
through 
the 
magazine 
. 
when 
i 
was 
done UnrelEv_bath
with 
my 
bath 
i 
pulled ScrEv_open_drain
the 
plug 
and 
drained RelNScrEv_bath
the 
water 
. 
then 
i 
turned+on RelNScrEv_bath
the 
shower 
to 
rinse RelNScrEv_bath
myself 
off 
. 
once 
all 
the 
soap 
was UnrelEv_bath
off 
i 
stepped+out ScrEv_get_out_bath
. 
i 
dried+off ScrEv_dry
and 
then 
put+on ScrEv_get_dressed
my 
robe 
. 
i 
was 
now 
done UnrelEv_bath
taking+a+bath Evoking_bath

nothing 
more 
relaxing ScrEv_relax
then 
taking+a+nice+hot+bath Evoking_bath
after 
a 
long 
day

work 
. 
when 
i 
got UnrelEv_bath

thing 
i 
did+was UnrelEv_bath
start ScrEv_turn_water_on
the 
running ScrEv_fill_water/wait
water 
in 
the 
tub 
. 
i 
made+sure ScrEv_check_temp
the 
temperature 
was UnrelEv_bath
perfect 
before 
putting ScrEv_close_drain
the 
drain 
stopper 
in 
place 
. 
i 
then 
went RelNScrEv_bath
to 
my 
room 
and 
got ScrEv_take_clean_clothes
some 
clean 
clothes 
and 
a 
towel 
from 
the 
closet 
. 
i 
like UnrelEv_bath
to 
listen RelNScrEv_bath
to 
music 
when 
i 
take+a+bath RelNScrEv_bath
so 
i 
brought+along ScrEv_prepare_bath
my 
i-pod 
and 
small 
speakers 
. 
when 
the 
tub 
was 
almost 
filled ScrEv_fill_water/wait
i 
stop ScrEv_turn_water_off
the 
water 
, 
turned ScrEv_prepare_bath
the 
music 
on 
, 
and 
stepped ScrEv_sink_water
inside 
the 
tub 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_bath
like 
a 
little 
piece 
of 
heaven 
as 
the 
warm 
water 
washed+over ScrEv_relax
my 
body 
. 
after 
about 
523 
minutes 
of 
relaxing ScrEv_relax
i 
found ScrEv_prepare_bath
the 
soap 
and 
started UnrelEv_bath
to 
apply ScrEv_wash
it 
all 
over 
my 
body 
. 
when 
i 
was 
finished UnrelEv_bath
i 
pulled ScrEv_open_drain
the 
drain 
stopper 
and 
started UnrelEv_bath
to 
rinse ScrEv_wash
the 
soap 
off 
. 
after 
all 
the

was 
drained RelNScrEv_bath
i 
grabbed ScrEv_get_towel
my

and 
started UnrelEv_bath
to 
dry+off ScrEv_dry
, 
then 
i 
finally 
slipped ScrEv_get_dressed
into 
my 
clean 
clothes 
. 
it 
was 
so 
relaxing ScrEv_relax
, 
i 
just 
ca

it 
again 
very 
soon

<end_of_story>_bath 
last 
week 
, 
i 
decided UnrelEv_bath
to 
take+a+nice+relaxing+bubble+bath Evoking_bath
after 
a 
hard 
day 
of 
work 
. 
after 
getting+done UnrelEv_bath
with 
my 
chores 
, 
i 
went RelNScrEv_bath
up 
stairs 
into 
the 
bedroom 
to 
grab ScrEv_take_clean_clothes
some 
clothes 
. 
after 
finding+on ScrEv_take_clean_clothes
what 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_bath
to 
wear Unclear_bath
, 
i 
went ScrEv_enter_bathroom
into 
the 
bathroom 
and 
shut RelNScrEv_bath
the 
door 
. 
i 
went RelNScrEv_bath
to 
the 
bath 
tub 
, 
and 
turned+on ScrEv_turn_water_on
the 
faucet 
. 
i 
messed+around ScrEv_turn_water_on
with 
the 
knobs 
on 
the 
faucet 
to 
get ScrEv_turn_water_on
some 
hot 
water 
that 
was UnrelEv_bath
perfect 
temperature 
. 
after 
i 
found ScrEv_check_temp
the 
perfect 
temperature 
i 
then 
plug ScrEv_close_drain
the 
drain 
and 
then 
put ScrEv_put_bubble_bath_scent
a 
small 
amount 
of 
bubble 
bath 
into 
the 
tub 
. 
while 
i 
am 
waiting ScrEv_fill_water/wait
for 
the 
water 
to 
raise ScrEv_fill_water/wait
, 
i 
take+off ScrEv_undress
my 
clothes

put RelNScrEv_bath
them 
into 
the 
laundry 
basket 
. 
after 
the

is UnrelEv_bath
at 
an 
acceptable 
level

i 
turn+off ScrEv_turn_water_off
the

a 
while

i 
put ScrEv_get_dressed
my 
new 
clothes 
on 
and 
clean+up ScrEv_other_bath
the

<end_of_story>_bath 
today 
i 
took+a+bath Evoking_bath
in 
my 
new 
apartment 
. 
it 
is UnrelEv_bath
the 
first 
time 
i 
bathed Evoking_bath
there 
so 
i 
need 
to 
get ScrEv_prepare_bath
my 
things 
ready 
. 
first 
, 
i 
turned+on ScrEv_turn_water_on
the 
water 
and 
filled ScrEv_fill_water/wait
the 
bath 
up 
with 
nice 
warm 
water 
. 
i 
made+sure UnrelEv_bath
that 
i 
have ScrEv_prepare_bath
my 
shampoo 
, 
soap 
, 
and 
sponge 
ready 
to 
get+in ScrEv_sink_water
. 
once 
i 
have ScrEv_prepare_bath
those 
things 
, 
i 
hang ScrEv_prepare_bath
my 
towel 
up 
on 
the 
towel 
rack 
and 
sink ScrEv_sink_water
into 
the 
splendid 
bath 
. 
i 
always 
put ScrEv_prepare_bath
some 
music 
so 
i 
can 
sing+along RelNScrEv_bath
in 
the 
shower 
. 
i 
make+sure UnrelEv_bath
i 
scrub ScrEv_wash
real 
good 
, 
especially 
behind 
my 
ears 
. 
after 
i 
get ScrEv_wash
squeaky 
clean 
i 
relax ScrEv_relax
for 
a 
little 
while 
longer 
, 
and 
get+out ScrEv_get_out_bath
the 
shower 
before 
i 
get RelNScrEv_bath
wrinkly 
skin 
. 
once 
im UnrelEv_bath
out 
i 
shake+off RelNScrEv_bath
the 
excess 
water 
and 
dry ScrEv_dry
my 
body 
real 
good 
with 
the 
towel 
, 
then 
i 
dry ScrEv_dry
my 
hair 
with 
the 
blow 
dryer 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_bath
a 
nice 
bath 
. 
<end_of_story>_bath 
i 
love UnrelEv_bath
taking+baths Evoking_bath
! 
they 
are UnrelEv_bath
so 
relaxing ScrEv_relax
after 
a 
long 
day 
. 
when 
i 
get UnrelEv_bath
home 
from 
work 
, 
often 
, 
the 
first 
thing 
i 
do+is+start UnrelEv_bath
to 
fill ScrEv_fill_water/wait
the 
bathtub 
. 
i 
set ScrEv_check_temp
the 
water 
temperature 
to 
a 
nice 
warm 
setting 
. 
while 
the 
tub 
is 
filling ScrEv_fill_water/wait
, 
i 
will 
gather ScrEv_prepare_bath
two 
fluffy 
towels 
and 
a 
face 
cloth 
. 
i 
also 
pour ScrEv_prepare_bath
myself 
a 
glass 
of 
ice 
water 
to 
sip RelNScrEv_bath
on 
while 
i 
'm 
soaking ScrEv_relax
. 
i 
go UnrelEv_bath
and 
grab ScrEv_prepare_bath
the 
latest 
magazine 
that 
i 
've 
been 
waiting UnrelEv_bath
to 
read UnrelEv_bath
and 
put ScrEv_prepare_bath
it 
next 
to 
the 
tub 
. 
once 
the 
tub 
is 
filled ScrEv_fill_water/wait
, 
i 
climb+in ScrEv_sink_water
. 
i 
start UnrelEv_bath
by 
washing ScrEv_wash
my 
face 
and 
then 
my 
hair 
. 
after 
my 
hair 
is 
washed ScrEv_wash
, 
i 
put Unclear_bath
a 
deep 
conditioner 
in 
my 
hair 
. 
now 
, 
it 
's UnrelEv_bath
time 
to 
relax ScrEv_relax
. 
i 
let UnrelEv_bath
the 
conditioner 
sit RelNScrEv_bath
while 
i 
read RelNScrEv_bath
my 
magazine 
and 
sip RelNScrEv_bath
some 
water 
. 
after 
523 
minutes 
, 
i 
rinse ScrEv_wash
my 
hair 
out 
and 
then 
wash ScrEv_wash
my 
body 
with 
soap 
. 
i 
rinse+off ScrEv_wash
and 
then 
give UnrelEv_bath
myself 
a 
few 
more 
minutes 
of 
soaking ScrEv_relax
before 
i 
empty ScrEv_open_drain
the 
tub 
. 
after 
i 
dry+off ScrEv_dry
, 
i 
rinse ScrEv_other_bath
the 
tub 
out 
to 
make+sure UnrelEv_bath
that 
i 
leave RelNScrEv_bath
the 
tub 
clean 
and 
shiny 
for 
the 
next 
time 
i 
use+it Evoking_bath
. 
<end_of_story>_bath 
i 
prefer UnrelEv_bath
a 
shower 
over 
a 
bath 
, 
but 
when 
i 
need 
to 
take+a+bath Evoking_bath
it 
's UnrelEv_bath
to 
relax ScrEv_relax
from 
a 
stressful 
evening 
. 
taking+a+bath Evoking_bath
requires UnrelEv_bath
filling ScrEv_fill_water/wait
the 
whole 
tub 
up 
with 
warm 
water 
. 
this 
may 
take UnrelEv_bath
some 
time 
and 
i 
will 
have 
to 
be+sure UnrelEv_bath
to 
have ScrEv_close_drain
a 
stopper 
to 
prevent ScrEv_close_drain
the 
water 
from 
draining+away RelNScrEv_bath
from 
the 
tub 
. 
while 
the 
water 
is 
filling+up ScrEv_fill_water/wait
, 
i 
will 
add ScrEv_put_bubble_bath_scent
the 
bubble 
bath 
solution 
to 
make UnrelEv_bath
the 
water 
soapy 
and 
fragrant 
. 
the 
aroma 
in 
the 
bath 
is UnrelEv_bath
what 
de-stresses ScrEv_relax
me 
. 
usually 
it 
'll 
be UnrelEv_bath
a 
nice 
lavender 
smell 
or 
something 
not 
too 
strong 
but 
is UnrelEv_bath
very 
pleasant 
to 
smell RelNScrEv_bath
. 
once 
the 
tub 
is 
filled ScrEv_fill_water/wait
, 
i 
will 
slowly 
enter ScrEv_sink_water
myself 
into 
the 
water 
. 
this 
can 
be UnrelEv_bath
tough 
at 
first 
because 
the 
water 
is UnrelEv_bath
usually 
too 
hot 
in 
the 
beginning 
so 
i 
will 
ease RelNScrEv_bath
myself 
in 
. 
but 
once 
in 
, 
the 
bath 
will 
really 
work UnrelEv_bath
to 
help+get UnrelEv_bath
the 
blood 
circulating RelNScrEv_bath
to 
get ScrEv_relax
a 
nice 
feeling 
of 
relaxation 
. 
i 
will 
typically 
stay+in ScrEv_relax
until 
the 
water 
is UnrelEv_bath
no 
longer 
warm 
or 
the 
bubbles 
have 
gone+away RelNScrEv_bath
. 
so 
when 
the 
water 
is UnrelEv_bath
just 
lukewarm 
, 
i 
will 
drain ScrEv_open_drain
the 
tub 
and 
then 
rinse+off RelNScrEv_bath
using UnrelEv_bath
the 
normal 
shower 
. 
<end_of_story>_bath 
i 
thought UnrelEv_bath
about 
taking UnrelEv_bath
my 
usual 
shower 
today 
, 
but 
decided UnrelEv_bath
to 
take+a+bath Evoking_bath
instead 
. 
i 
have 
had UnrelEv_bath
a 
stressful 
week 
and 
the 
relaxation 
will 
do UnrelEv_bath
me 
good 
. 
i 
get ScrEv_prepare_bath
everything 
ready 
that 
i 
will 
need-my UnrelEv_bath
towel 
, 
my 
bath 
beads 
, 
a 
book 
and 
a 
candle 
. 
i 
run ScrEv_turn_water_on
the 
water 
just 
a 
bit 
on 
the 
warm 
side 
since 
i 
do 
n't 
want UnrelEv_bath
the 
bath 
getting RelNScrEv_bath
cold 
too 
soon 
. 
i 
put ScrEv_close_drain
the 
stopper 
in 
on 
the 
bath 
drain 
and 
then 
pour+in ScrEv_put_bubble_bath_scent
my 
bath 
beads 
. 
time 
to 
run ScrEv_fill_water/wait
the 
water 
. 
i 
've 
lit ScrEv_prepare_bath
my 
candle 
and 
grabbed ScrEv_prepare_bath
my 
book 
. 
i 
love UnrelEv_bath
to 
soak ScrEv_relax
for 
a 
bit 
, 
it 
's UnrelEv_bath
so 
relaxing ScrEv_relax
. 
i 
will 
get+through RelNScrEv_bath
a 
chapter 
or 
two 
of 
my 
book 
, 
depending UnrelEv_bath
how 
fast 
i 
feel UnrelEv_bath
like 
reading RelNScrEv_bath
. 
the 
whole 
atmosphere 
is 
de-stressing ScrEv_relax
me 
. 
after 
my 
bath 
, 
i 
will 
towel+off ScrEv_dry
and 
get ScrEv_get_dressed
into 
my 
pajamas 
. 
i 
always 
seem UnrelEv_bath
to 
sleep UnrelEv_bath
better 
after 
taking+a+relaxing+bath Evoking_bath
. 
<end_of_story>_bath 
every 
day 
i 
wash ScrEv_wash
myself 
in 
one 
form 
or 
another 
. 
it 
is UnrelEv_bath
imperative 
to 
stay UnrelEv_bath
clean 
and 
hygienic 
. 
last 
night 
i 
decided UnrelEv_bath
to 
switch+up UnrelEv_bath
my 
normal 
routine 
of 
taking UnrelEv_bath
a 
shower 
, 
and 
decided UnrelEv_bath
to 
take+a+nice+bubble+bath Evoking_bath
! 
to 
prepare ScrEv_prepare_bath
for 
the 
luscious 
endeavor 
, 
i 
stopped UnrelEv_bath
at 
lush 
on 
my 
way 
home 
from 
work 
. 
lush 
has UnrelEv_bath
a 
variety 
of 
` 
bath 
bombs 
' 
that 
can 
be 
used UnrelEv_bath
to 
enhance RelNScrEv_bath
a 
bath 
. 
i 
found ScrEv_prepare_bath
a 
dragonfruit-passionberry 
bomb 
, 
and 
purchased ScrEv_prepare_bath
it 
. 
although 
i 
am UnrelEv_bath
a 
straight 
man 
, 
i 
love UnrelEv_bath
to 
pamper RelNScrEv_bath
myself 
. 
getting UnrelEv_bath
home 
, 
the 
first 
thing 
i 
did+was UnrelEv_bath
turn ScrEv_turn_water_on
the 
hot 
water 
on 
in 
the 
bath 
to 
fill ScrEv_fill_water/wait
it 
up 
. 
the 
warm 
water 
filled ScrEv_fill_water/wait
the 
tub 
and 
tendrils 
of 
mist 
rose RelNScrEv_bath
from 
the 
steamy 
water 
. 
the 
warmth 
was 
positively 
inviting RelNScrEv_bath
! 
i 
dropped ScrEv_put_bubble_bath_scent
the 
bath 
bomb 
in 
and 
stepped ScrEv_sink_water
into 
the 
tub 
myself 
. 
lowering ScrEv_sink_water
myself 
slowly 
into 
the 
water 
's 
embrace 
, 
i 
relaxed ScrEv_relax
fully 
. 
after 
spending RelNScrEv_bath
523 
minutes 
and 
becoming RelNScrEv_bath
a 
pruny 
mass 
, 
my 
bath 
was UnrelEv_bath
complete 
and 
my 
whole 
persona 
was UnrelEv_bath
now 
clean 
. 
<end_of_story>_bath 
sometimes 
after 
a 
long 
, 
hard 
, 
stressful 
day 
at 
the 
office 
, 
the 
best 
thing 
to 
do UnrelEv_bath
when 
you 
get UnrelEv_bath
home 
is UnrelEv_bath
to 
take+a+nice+,+hot+,+relaxing+bubble+bath Evoking_bath
! 
that 
is UnrelEv_bath
exactly 
what 
i 
did UnrelEv_bath
after 
coming UnrelEv_bath
home 
on 
monday 
afternoon 
. 
i 
decided UnrelEv_bath
i 
would 
make UnrelEv_bath
it 
as 
relaxing ScrEv_relax
as 
possible 
and 
pretend UnrelEv_bath
that 
i 
was Unclear_bath
at 
a 
spa 
. 
i 
went+up ScrEv_enter_bathroom
to 
the 
bathroom 
and 
started UnrelEv_bath
to 
draw ScrEv_turn_water_on
the 
warm 
water 
into 
the 
tub 
. 
while 
that 
was 
filling+up ScrEv_fill_water/wait
i 
then 
went+down RelNScrEv_bath
to 
the 
kitchen 
and 
grabbed ScrEv_prepare_bath
a 
bottle 
of 
wine 
and 
a 
glass 
and 
took ScrEv_prepare_bath
it 
upstairs 
to 
sip RelNScrEv_bath
as 
i 
soaked ScrEv_relax
. 
to 
complete UnrelEv_bath
my 
ultimate 
relaxation 
bath 
night 
i 
grabbed ScrEv_prepare_bath
my 
blue 
tooth 
speaker 
and 
set ScrEv_prepare_bath
it 
up 
to 
play RelNScrEv_bath
some 
relaxing ScrEv_relax
music 
while 
i 
was UnrelEv_bath
in 
the 
tub 
. 
i 
then 
added ScrEv_put_bubble_bath_scent
some 
bubble 
bath 
and 
got+in ScrEv_sink_water
. 
first 
i 
washed ScrEv_wash
my 
hair 
and 
then 
my 
body 
and 
then 
it 
was UnrelEv_bath
time 
to 
relax ScrEv_relax
and 
soak ScrEv_relax
until 
my 
skin 
started UnrelEv_bath
to 
look Unclear_bath
like 
a 
raisin 
. 
<end_of_story>_bath 
taking+a+bath Evoking_bath
is UnrelEv_bath
a 
delightful 
experience 
. 
i 
first 
set ScrEv_prepare_bath
the 
scene 
by 
putting+on ScrEv_prepare_bath
some 
music 
, 
maybe 
even 
some 
candles 
if 
i 
'm 
feeling UnrelEv_bath
particularly 
luxurious 
. 
some 
people 
like UnrelEv_bath
to 
have RelNScrEv_bath
a 
glass 
of 
wine 
or 
two 
, 
but 
i 
prefer UnrelEv_bath
a 
refreshing RelNScrEv_bath
diet 
coke 
in 
my 
bath 
. 
i 
like UnrelEv_bath
trying+out ScrEv_put_bubble_bath_scent
different 
bath 
bombs 
and 
bath 
melts 
from 
beauty 
stores 
like 
lush 
, 
they 
scent RelNScrEv_bath
the 
water 
, 
create RelNScrEv_bath
bubbles 
and 
contribute UnrelEv_bath
to 
an 
overall 
pleasant 
experience 
. 
i 
fill ScrEv_fill_water/wait
the 
bath 
with 
warm 
to 
hot 
water 
, 
since 
i 
like UnrelEv_bath
to 
bathe Evoking_bath
after 
a 
good 
workout 
and 
my 
sore 
body 
appreciates Unclear_bath
the 
heat 
. 
if 
i 
'm 
using UnrelEv_bath
bubble 
bath 
i 
can 
pour ScrEv_put_bubble_bath_scent
it 
in 
with 
the 
water 
, 
if 
i 
'm 
using UnrelEv_bath
a 
bath 
bomb 
i 
crumble ScrEv_put_bubble_bath_scent
it 
in 
little 
by 
little 
. 
once 
the 
water 
is UnrelEv_bath
at 
an 
appropriate 
depth 
i 
turn+off ScrEv_turn_water_off
the 
faucet 
and 
sink ScrEv_sink_water
into 
bliss 
. 
i 
let UnrelEv_bath
myself 
soak ScrEv_relax
until 
the 
water 
cools RelNScrEv_bath
too 
much 
and 
by 
then 
i 
feel UnrelEv_bath
refreshed RelNScrEv_bath
and 
content 
. 
<end_of_story>_bath 
as 
a 
child 
, 
i 
loved UnrelEv_bath
taking+baths Evoking_bath
. 
my 
mother 
always 
had 
to 
fill ScrEv_fill_water/wait
the 
tub 
for 
me 
so 
that 
the 
water 
would 
not 
be UnrelEv_bath
too 
hot 
or 
too 
cold 
. 
i 
'd 
say UnrelEv_bath
that 
the 
ideal 
temperature 
for 
the 
water 
was ScrEv_check_temp
about 
523 
degrees 
. 
my 
favorite 
part 
of 
taking+a+bath Evoking_bath
was UnrelEv_bath
the 
bubbles 
. 
i 
loved UnrelEv_bath
to 
splash RelNScrEv_bath
around 
the 
tub 
and 
play RelNScrEv_bath
with 
the 
bubbles 
. 
once 
i 
sat ScrEv_sink_water
in 
the 
tub 
, 
i 
used UnrelEv_bath
shampoo 
to 
wash ScrEv_wash
my 
hair 
and 
a 
washed ScrEv_wash
my 
body 
with 
a 
soapy 
washcloth 
. 
i 
made+sure UnrelEv_bath
to 
wash ScrEv_wash
behind 
my 
ears 
and 
on 
my 
face 
as 
well 
. 
once 
i 
was UnrelEv_bath
clean 
, 
i 
would 
play RelNScrEv_bath
with 
my 
bath 
toys 
for 
a 
little 
while 
. 
after 
some 
time 
has 
passed UnrelEv_bath
, 
i 
drained ScrEv_open_drain
the 
water 
. 
after 
draining ScrEv_open_drain
the 
water 
, 
i 
would 
stand+up ScrEv_get_out_bath
and 
dry ScrEv_dry
myself 
off 
with 
a 
towel 
. 
i 
enjoyed UnrelEv_bath
taking+baths Evoking_bath
because 
i 
often 
needed UnrelEv_bath
to 
be 
cleaned RelNScrEv_bath
, 
i 
loved UnrelEv_bath
to 
play UnrelEv_bath
outside 
as 
a 
kid 
. 
<end_of_story>_bath 
when 
i 
have UnrelEv_bath
a 
long 
day 
at 
work 
, 
i 
like UnrelEv_bath
to 
take+a+bath Evoking_bath
before 
i 
go UnrelEv_bath
to 
bed 
. 
baths 
are UnrelEv_bath
very 
relaxing ScrEv_relax
. 
they 
make UnrelEv_bath
me 
sleepy 
and 
feel 
nice 
. 
i 
start UnrelEv_bath
my 
bath 
by 
turning+on ScrEv_turn_water_on
the 
warm 
water 
faucet 
. 
then 
i 
plug ScrEv_close_drain
the 
drain 
so 
the 
water 
will 
stay RelNScrEv_bath
in 
the 
tub 
. 
sometimes 
i 
pour ScrEv_put_bubble_bath_scent
some 
bubble 
bath 
into 
the 
tub 
. 
when 
i 
do UnrelEv_bath
this 
, 
i 
pour ScrEv_put_bubble_bath_scent
a 
little 
bit 
of 
bubble 
bath 
liquid 
under 
the 
running ScrEv_fill_water/wait
water 
. 
whenever 
the 
tub 
is UnrelEv_bath
about 
halfway 
full 
of 
water 
, 
i 
get ScrEv_sink_water
in 
the 
tub 
and 
relax ScrEv_relax
. 
sometimes 
i 
read RelNScrEv_bath
a 
book 
in 
the 
bathtub 
, 
and 
other 
times 
i 
simply 
sit RelNScrEv_bath
there 
. 
when 
i 
am 
not 
reading RelNScrEv_bath
, 
i 
often 
think RelNScrEv_bath
about 
my 
day 
and 
what 
i 
will 
do UnrelEv_bath
tomorrow 
. 
after 
about 
523 
or 
523 
minutes 
, 
i 
decide UnrelEv_bath
to 
get+out ScrEv_get_out_bath
of 
the 
tub 
. 
i 
drain ScrEv_open_drain
the 
water 
and 
bubbles

my 
bath 
is UnrelEv_bath
over

<end_of_story>_bath 
it 
had 
been UnrelEv_bath
a 
long 
, 
hard 
day 
and 
i 
needed+a+good+bath Evoking_bath

first 
i 
picked+out ScrEv_take_clean_clothes
clean 
clothes 
and 
got ScrEv_prepare_bath
towels 
from 
the 
hall 
closet 
. 
then 
i 
went ScrEv_enter_bathroom
into 
the 
bathroom 
. 
i 
put ScrEv_close_drain
the 
plug 
in 
the 
bathtub 
drain 
, 
and 
then 
started UnrelEv_bath
to 
fill ScrEv_fill_water/wait
the 
tub 
with 
nice 
hot 
water 
. 
not 
too 
hot 
though 
. 
i 
disrobed ScrEv_undress
and 
stepped ScrEv_sink_water
into 
the 
tub 
, 
then 
carefully 
settled+in ScrEv_sink_water
. 
first 
i 
got ScrEv_wash
my 
hair 
wet 
, 
shampooed ScrEv_wash
, 
and 
washed+away ScrEv_wash
the 
shampoo 
using RelNScrEv_bath

toy 
bucket 
. 
i 
wet ScrEv_apply_soap
my 
washcloth 
, 
rubbed ScrEv_apply_soap
it 
heartily 
with 
soap 
until 
a 
lather 
formed RelNScrEv_bath
, 
and 
then 
scrubbed ScrEv_wash
my 
skin 
all 
over 
until 
i 
was UnrelEv_bath
good 
and 
clean 
. 
i 
submerged ScrEv_sink_water
in 
the 
tub 
water 
and 
soaked ScrEv_relax
for 
a 
while 
. 
i 
spent RelNScrEv_bath
a 
bit 
of 
time 
with 
a 
toy 
submarine 
, 
pretending UnrelEv_bath
it 
was UnrelEv_bath
in 
the 
ocean 
. 
at 
the 
end 
, 
i 
pulled ScrEv_open_drain
the 
plug 
and 
let UnrelEv_bath
the 
water 
drain RelNScrEv_bath
. 
i 
took RelNScrEv_bath
a 
quick 
shower 
to 
rinse+off RelNScrEv_bath
any 
soap 
. 
then 
i 
dried ScrEv_dry
myself 
, 
got+out ScrEv_get_out_bath
of 
the 
tub 
and 
put ScrEv_get_dressed
on 
the 
clean 
clothes 
. 
i 
felt RelNScrEv_bath
much 
better 
.

i 
undress ScrEv_undress
and 
gently 
touch ScrEv_check_temp
the 
water 
with 
my 
foot 
to 
ensure ScrEv_check_temp
its 
comfort 
. 
then 
i 
go ScrEv_sink_water
fully 
into 
the 
water 
and 
take ScrEv_relax
a 
deep 
breath 
for 
relaxation 
.

but 
leave RelNScrEv_bath
the

open 
to 
remove ScrEv_other_bath
the

now 
complete

<end_of_story>_bath 
it 
was UnrelEv_bath
saturday 
night 
so 
it 
was UnrelEv_bath
time 
for 
me 
to 
take+my+weekly+bath Evoking_bath
. 
i 
turned+on ScrEv_turn_water_on
the 
hot 
water 
and 
waited ScrEv_fill_water/wait
for 
the 
water 
coming+out RelNScrEv_bath
of 
the 
tap 
to 
get ScrEv_check_temp
warm 
. 
when 
it 
did UnrelEv_bath
, 
i 
closed ScrEv_close_drain
the 
stopper 
and 
waited ScrEv_fill_water/wait
for 
the 
bath 
to 
fill ScrEv_fill_water/wait
. 
while 
it 
was 
doing UnrelEv_bath
so 
, 
i 
took ScrEv_prepare_bath
some 
bath 
salts 
from 
the 
shelf 
and 
added ScrEv_put_bubble_bath_scent
them 
to 
the 
water 
. 
i 
could 
smell RelNScrEv_bath
lavender 
. 
when 
the 
bath 
was UnrelEv_bath
full 
, 
i 
lit ScrEv_prepare_bath
a 
candle 
and 
then 
took+off ScrEv_undress
my 
clothes 
and 
got ScrEv_sink_water
in 
the 
water 
. 
i 
closed ScrEv_relax
my 
eyes 
and 
soaked ScrEv_relax
for 
a 
while 
, 
feeling UnrelEv_bath
the 
hot 
water 
relax ScrEv_relax
my 
sore 
muscles 
. 
after 
a 
few 
minutes 
i 
grabbed ScrEv_prepare_bath
a 
bar 
of 
soap 
and 
a 
washcloth 
and 
scrubbed ScrEv_wash
my 
body 
, 
taking+off ScrEv_wash
the

dead 
skin 
. 
then 
i 
soaked ScrEv_relax
some 
more 
, 
almost 
falling+asleep RelNScrEv_bath
. 
finally 
, 
it 
was UnrelEv_bath
time 
to 
get+out ScrEv_get_out_bath
so 
i 
let+out ScrEv_open_drain
the 
water 
, 
grabbed ScrEv_get_towel
a

dried+off ScrEv_dry
. 
<end_of_story>_bath 
i 
love UnrelEv_bath
to 
go+work+out UnrelEv_bath
at 
the 
gym 
. 
i 
tend UnrelEv_bath
to 
lift UnrelEv_bath
for 
a 
long 
time 
until 
i 
'm 
spent UnrelEv_bath
of 
any 
excess 
energy 
. 
after 
that 
i 
'll 
get UnrelEv_bath
on 
the 
arc 
trainer 
and 
start+sweating UnrelEv_bath
a 
great 
deal 
. 
i 
say UnrelEv_bath
this 
to 
illustrate UnrelEv_bath
the 
point 
that 
after 
this 
work 
out 
i 
am RelNScrEv_bath
in 
great 
need 
of 
a 
bath 
. 
i 
come UnrelEv_bath
home 
and 
welcome UnrelEv_bath
my 
ritual 
of 
taking+a+bath Evoking_bath
. 
i 
get ScrEv_prepare_bath
my 
phone 
out 
and 
find ScrEv_prepare_bath
my 
favorite 
pandora 
station 
that 
matches UnrelEv_bath
my 
current 
mood 
. 
i 
then 
get ScrEv_turn_water_on
the 
water 
rolling ScrEv_fill_water/wait
at 
a 
hot 
temperature 
. 
i 
get 
undressed ScrEv_undress
and 
in 
the 
tub 
. 
i 
like 
to 
sit ScrEv_sink_water
there 
for 
a 
while 
and 
reflect RelNScrEv_bath
while 
i 
relax ScrEv_relax
. 
after 
a 
few 
minutes 
i 
'll 
lather ScrEv_wash
my 
hair 
and 
clean ScrEv_wash
it 
out 
. 
i 
might 
drain ScrEv_open_drain
the 
tub 
and 
put+in ScrEv_turn_water_on
more 
water 
. 
lastly 
i 
'll 
soap+off ScrEv_wash
the 
nastiness 
of 
the 
gym

<end_of_story>_bath 
i 
had 
been UnrelEv_bath
out 
working UnrelEv_bath
in 
the 
garden 
and 
was UnrelEv_bath
quite 
dirty 
, 
so 
i 
decided UnrelEv_bath
to 
take+a+bath Evoking_bath
. 
i 
went ScrEv_enter_bathroom
into 
the 
bathroom 
and 
plugged ScrEv_close_drain
the 
hole 
, 
so 
the 
water 
would 
fill+up ScrEv_fill_water/wait
. 
i 
turned+on ScrEv_turn_water_on
the 
hot 
water 
and 
i 
turned+on ScrEv_turn_water_on
the 
cold 
water 
until 
it 
was ScrEv_check_temp
a 
pleasant 
temperature 
. 
i 
added ScrEv_put_bubble_bath_scent
some 
bubble 
bath 
to 
the 
water 
and 
let UnrelEv_bath
the 
tub 
fill ScrEv_fill_water/wait
all 
the 
way 
up 
. 
i 
got UnrelEv_bath
undressed ScrEv_undress
and 
stepped ScrEv_sink_water
into 
the 
bath 
tub 
. 
i 
used RelNScrEv_bath
soap 
and 
a 
washcloth 
to 
clean ScrEv_wash
myself 
. 
i 
used RelNScrEv_bath
shampoo 
to 
clean ScrEv_wash
my 
hair 
then 
i 
put ScrEv_wash
conditioner 
in 
, 
so 
that 
my 
hair 
would 
be UnrelEv_bath
soft 
and 
silky 
. 
i 
let UnrelEv_bath
the 
conditioner 
soak+in RelNScrEv_bath
for 
awhile 
and 
then 
i 
rinsed ScrEv_wash
it 
out 
. 
i 
rinsed+off RelNScrEv_bath
the 
soap 
from 
my 
body 
and 
got+out ScrEv_get_out_bath
of 
the 
tub 
. 
i 
grabbed ScrEv_get_towel
a 
towel 
and 
dried+off ScrEv_dry
. 
then 
i 
got UnrelEv_bath
dressed ScrEv_get_dressed
and 
went UnrelEv_bath
about 
my 
day 
. 
<end_of_story>_bath 
i 
was 
feeling UnrelEv_bath
like 
relaxing ScrEv_relax
after 
a 
long 
day 
, 
so 
i 
had UnrelEv_bath
the 
idea 
to 
take+a+bath Evoking_bath
. 
i 
went ScrEv_enter_bathroom
to 
the 
bathroom 
. 
i 
removed ScrEv_undress
my 
clothes

then 
i 
started ScrEv_turn_water_on
the 
water 
and 
adjusted ScrEv_check_temp
the 
temperature 
with 
the 
faucet 
. 
i 
grabbed ScrEv_prepare_bath
some 
bath 
oils 
and 
put ScrEv_put_bubble_bath_scent
them 
in 
the 
water 
. 
once 
the 
water 
was UnrelEv_bath
high 
enough 
, 
i 
stepped ScrEv_sink_water
into 
the 
tub 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_bath
very 
warm 
. 
i 
slid ScrEv_sink_water
my 
body 
underneath 
the 
water 
. 
steam 
drifted+up RelNScrEv_bath
from 
the 
surface 
of 
the 
water 
. 
i 
felt UnrelEv_bath
my 
muscles 
loosening+up ScrEv_relax
and 
relaxing ScrEv_relax
. 
the 
bath 
oils 
gave+off RelNScrEv_bath
a 
minty 
aroma 
. 
after 
some 
time 
luxuriating ScrEv_relax
in 
the 
water 
, 
i 
took RelNScrEv_bath
my 
washcloth 
and 
put ScrEv_apply_soap
some 
soap 
on 
it 
. 
i 
began UnrelEv_bath
to 
soap+up ScrEv_wash
my 
skin 
. 
i 
started UnrelEv_bath
with 
my 
face 
, 
then 
worked ScrEv_wash
my 
way 
down 
to 
my 
feet 
. 
once 
i 
went RelNScrEv_bath
over 
my 
whole 
body 
, 
i 
rinsed+off RelNScrEv_bath
the 
washcloth 
and 
hung RelNScrEv_bath
it 
up 
. 
the 
water 
began UnrelEv_bath
to 
feel RelNScrEv_bath
lukewarm 
, 
so 
i 
decided UnrelEv_bath
to 
end RelNScrEv_bath
my 
bath 
. 
i 
took+out ScrEv_open_drain
the 
stopper 
and 
stepped ScrEv_get_out_bath

i 
turned+on RelNScrEv_bath
the

it 
was UnrelEv_bath
quiet

i 
turned+on ScrEv_turn_water_on
the

adjusted ScrEv_check_temp
it 
to 
get ScrEv_check_temp
just 
the 
right 
temperature 
, 
then 
put+in ScrEv_close_drain
the 
drain 
plug 
. 
i 
got ScrEv_prepare_bath
a 
towel 
out 
of 
the 
pantry 
and 
set ScrEv_prepare_bath
it 
on 
the 
counter 
for 
afterwards 
. 
when 
the 
tub 
was UnrelEv_bath
mostly 
full 
, 
i 
removed ScrEv_undress
my 
garments 
and 
got+in ScrEv_sink_water

i 
soaped+up ScrEv_apply_soap
a

squeezed RelNScrEv_bath
a

and 
rubbed ScrEv_wash
it 
into

after 
thoroughly 
scrubbing ScrEv_wash
my 
head 
, 
i 
dunked ScrEv_wash
it 
underwater

then 
i 
got UnrelEv_bath
dressed ScrEv_get_dressed
. 
i 
felt UnrelEv_bath
clean 
and 
refreshed ScrEv_relax
. 
<end_of_story>_bath 
i 
decided UnrelEv_bath
to 
take+a+bath Evoking_bath
today 
rather 
than 
a 
shower 
. 
first 
i 
scrubbed RelNScrEv_bath
the 
tub 
with 
cleanser 
and 
rinsed RelNScrEv_bath
it 
well 
. 
i 
put ScrEv_close_drain
the

and 
turned+on ScrEv_turn_water_on
the 
hot 
water 
. 
while 
the 
tub 
was 
filling ScrEv_fill_water/wait
i 
gathered ScrEv_prepare_bath
all 
the 
supplies 
i 
would 
need Unclear_bath
including UnrelEv_bath
my 
favorite 
bathrobe 
, 
bubble 
bath 
soap 
, 
a 
fresh

and 
a

bar 
of 
soap 
. 
i 
tied ScrEv_prepare_bath
my 
hair 
up 
into 
a 
bun 
. 
as 
the 
bath 
was 
nearing ScrEv_fill_water/wait
the 
level 
i 
desired UnrelEv_bath
i 
checked ScrEv_check_temp
the 
water 
temperature 
and 
added ScrEv_turn_water_on
just 
enough 
cold 
water 
to 
make Unclear_bath
it 
comfortable 
, 
and 
i 
added ScrEv_put_bubble_bath_scent
enough 
bubble 
bath 
to 
cover RelNScrEv_bath
the 
surface 
with 
foam 
. 
i 
carefully 
stepped ScrEv_sink_water
into 
the 
tub 
, 
immersed ScrEv_sink_water
myself 
, 
and 
remained ScrEv_relax
there 
for 
more 
than 
half 
an 
hour 
relaxing ScrEv_relax
. 
before 
the 
water 
go RelNScrEv_bath
too 
cold 
i 
used RelNScrEv_bath
the

first 
, 
i 
turned+on ScrEv_turn_water_on
the 
water 
. 
i 
fiddled ScrEv_check_temp
with 
the 
knobs 
to 
get ScrEv_check_temp
the 
right 
mix 
of 
hot 
and 
cold 
water 
. 
once 
the 
temperature 
was 
pleasing ScrEv_check_temp
to 
me 
, 
i 
put ScrEv_close_drain
the 
stopper 
in 
the 
tub 
and 
let UnrelEv_bath
the 
tub 
fill ScrEv_fill_water/wait
with 
water 
. 
i 
also 
poured ScrEv_put_bubble_bath_scent
some 
bubble 
bath 
into 
the 
water 
stream 
so 
that 
bubbles 
filled RelNScrEv_bath
the

, 
i 
took+off ScrEv_undress

in 
the 
tub 
. 
i 
submerged ScrEv_sink_water
my 
body 
in 
the 
soapy 
water 
. 
i 
used RelNScrEv_bath
a 
loofah 
to 
wash ScrEv_wash
myself 
. 
i 
then 
sat+back RelNScrEv_bath
and 
relaxed ScrEv_relax
in 
the 
tub 
for 
a 
while 
. 
i 
had 
put ScrEv_prepare_bath
the 
book 
that 
i 
was 
reading RelNScrEv_bath
on 
the

i 
decided UnrelEv_bath
to 
read RelNScrEv_bath
it 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_bath
very 
relaxing ScrEv_relax
. 
when 
i 
was

first 
, 
i 
showered RelNScrEv_bath
to 
get RelNScrEv_bath
the

then 
i 
stepped+over RelNScrEv_bath

stopped ScrEv_close_drain
the

i 
turned ScrEv_turn_water_on
the

was 
running ScrEv_fill_water/wait
, 
i 
opened RelNScrEv_bath

bit 
of 
the 
powder 
into 
the 
tub 
and 
the 
water 
started UnrelEv_bath
to 
foam+up RelNScrEv_bath

the 
bubbles 
smelled RelNScrEv_bath
like 
lavender 
and 
it 
was UnrelEv_bath
very 
relaxing ScrEv_relax
. 
when 
the

was 
filled ScrEv_fill_water/wait

i 
turned+off ScrEv_turn_water_off

a

. 
i 
found ScrEv_prepare_bath
my

poured ScrEv_prepare_bath
myself 
a 
glass 
of 
juice 
. 
i 
tied ScrEv_prepare_bath
my 
hair 
into 
a

and 
got ScrEv_prepare_bath
a 
towel 
and 
my 
robe

to 
put ScrEv_prepare_bath
next 
to 
the

then 
i 
tested ScrEv_check_temp
the

. 
it 
felt ScrEv_check_temp
warm 
but 
not 
too 
hot 
. 
i 
slipped ScrEv_sink_water
my

under 
the

relaxed ScrEv_relax
. 
i 
read RelNScrEv_bath
my

soaked ScrEv_relax
in 
the

when 
the

started UnrelEv_bath

too 
cold 
, 
i 
stood+up ScrEv_get_out_bath

i 
patted ScrEv_dry
myself 
dry 
and 
then 
put+on ScrEv_get_dressed
my

i 
pulled ScrEv_open_drain
the

<end_of_story>_bath 
a 
couple 
of 
nights 
ago 
i 
felt UnrelEv_bath
really 
sick 
, 
and 
one 
of 
the 
things 
that 
usually 
helps UnrelEv_bath
me 
feel 
better 
is UnrelEv_bath
to 
take+a+hot+bath Evoking_bath
. 
so 
i 
went ScrEv_enter_bathroom
into 
my 
bathroom 
and 
prepared ScrEv_prepare_bath
the 
bath 
tub 
. 
first 
i 
plugged ScrEv_close_drain
the 
drain 
so 
the 
water 
would 
n't 
escape RelNScrEv_bath
. 
then 
i 
turned+on ScrEv_turn_water_on
the 
hot 
water 
and 
let UnrelEv_bath
it 
fill+up ScrEv_fill_water/wait
. 
the 
process 
took UnrelEv_bath
about 
five 
minutes 
. 
i 
then 
tested ScrEv_check_temp
the 
water 
to 
see UnrelEv_bath
how 
hot 
it 
was UnrelEv_bath
, 
because 
i 
did 
n't 
want UnrelEv_bath
to 
jump ScrEv_sink_water
right 
in 
and 
burn RelNScrEv_bath
myself 
. 
i 
decided ScrEv_check_temp
it 
was UnrelEv_bath
a 
little 
too 
hot 
, 
so 
i 
let UnrelEv_bath
it 
cool 
for 
a 
couple 
of 
minutes 
. 
once 
the 
water 
was ScrEv_check_temp
a 
comfortable 
temperature 
i 
stepped+in ScrEv_sink_water
and 
laid+down ScrEv_sink_water
in 
the 
water 
. 
i 
let UnrelEv_bath
the 
warm 
water 
sooth ScrEv_relax
my 
aches 
and 
pains 
and 
i 
began UnrelEv_bath
to 
feel ScrEv_relax
better 
. 
i 
had 
n't 
taken UnrelEv_bath
a 
shower 
that 
day 
, 
so 
i 
decided UnrelEv_bath
i 
should 
also 
clean ScrEv_wash
myself 
while 
i 
was+in+the+bath Evoking_bath
. 
once 
that 
was UnrelEv_bath
over 
i 
unplugged ScrEv_open_drain
the

and 
dried ScrEv_dry
myself 
off 
. 
<end_of_story>_bath

first 
, 
i 
went+through RelNScrEv_bath

i 
found ScrEv_prepare_bath
my

, 
fluffiest

and 
set ScrEv_prepare_bath
it 
next 
to 
the 
bathtub 
. 
i 
turned+on ScrEv_turn_water_on
the 
water 
and 
let UnrelEv_bath
it 
run RelNScrEv_bath
until 
it 
was UnrelEv_bath
hot 
. 
once 
the 
water 
ran RelNScrEv_bath
hot 
, 
i 
shut ScrEv_close_drain
the 
drain 
, 
so 
the 
water 
would 
fill+up ScrEv_fill_water/wait
the 
top 
. 
then 
i 
poured ScrEv_put_bubble_bath_scent
my 
nice 
smelling RelNScrEv_bath
bath 
salts 
into 
the 
tub 
. 
they 
turned RelNScrEv_bath
the 
water 
a 
lovely 
pink 
color 
. 
i 
watched UnrelEv_bath
the 
water 
fill+up ScrEv_fill_water/wait
the 
tub 
and 
the 
bathroom 
became RelNScrEv_bath
steamy 
. 
i 
grabbed ScrEv_prepare_bath
a 
washcloth 
from 
the

and 
got ScrEv_sink_water
in 
the

enjoy ScrEv_relax
the

. 
it 
was UnrelEv_bath
very 
quiet 
and 
i 
almost 
fell+asleep RelNScrEv_bath
. 
when 
i 
was 
done UnrelEv_bath
, 
i 
emptied ScrEv_open_drain
the 
water 
out 
of 
the 
drain 
, 
toweled ScrEv_dry
myself 
off 
, 
and 
left ScrEv_leave
the

and 
grass 
, 
i 
drove UnrelEv_bath
in 
my 
car 
to 
my 
home 
so 
i 
could 
take+a+nice+warm+bath Evoking_bath
and 
clean RelNScrEv_bath
myself 
off 
. 
i 
opened UnrelEv_bath
the 
door 
and 
climbed UnrelEv_bath
the 
stairs 
so 
i 
could 
get UnrelEv_bath
into 
the 
bathroom 
. 
i 
turned ScrEv_turn_water_on
on 
the 
faucet 
in 
the 
claw 
tub 
and 
watched ScrEv_fill_water/wait
the 
water 
run 
and 
fill+up ScrEv_fill_water/wait
the 
tub 
. 
i 
added ScrEv_put_bubble_bath_scent
some 
of 
my 
favorite 
bubble 
bath 
mix 
to 
the 
hot 
water 
and 
watched UnrelEv_bath
in 
awe 
as 
the 
bubbles 
started UnrelEv_bath
filling RelNScrEv_bath
the 
tub 
. 
i 
could 
not 
wait UnrelEv_bath
to 
get+in RelNScrEv_bath
. 
i 
undressed ScrEv_undress
myself 
and 
put ScrEv_sink_water
one 
foot 
in 
at 
a 
time 
into 
the 
warm 
tub 
. 
the 
water 
was UnrelEv_bath
quite 
hot 
, 
so 
i 
was UnrelEv_bath
careful 
not 
to 
get+in ScrEv_sink_water
too 
quickly 
and 
burn RelNScrEv_bath
myself 
. 
as 
i 
got ScrEv_sink_water
into 
the 
tub 
, 
i 
laid UnrelEv_bath
there 
and 
simply 
relaxed ScrEv_relax
in 
peace 
. 
it 
felt UnrelEv_bath
so 
good 
. 
<end_of_story>_bath 
after 
a 
long 
week 
, 
i 
decided UnrelEv_bath
on 
a 
whim 
to 
take+a+bath Evoking_bath
. 
it 
had 
been UnrelEv_bath
years 
since 
i 
last 
took Evoking_bath
one 
; 
i 
honestly 
could 
n't 
remember UnrelEv_bath
the 
last 
time 
. 
as 
soon 
as 
i 
got UnrelEv_bath
home 
from 
work 
, 
i 
kicked+off UnrelEv_bath
my 
shoes 
, 
and 
walked UnrelEv_bath
excitedly 
up 
to 
the 
master 
bathroom 
. 
i 
plugged ScrEv_close_drain
the 
tub 
, 
and 
started UnrelEv_bath
running RelNScrEv_bath
the 
water 
. 
i 
adjusted ScrEv_check_temp
the 
temperature 
until 
it 
was UnrelEv_bath
just 
right 
: 
not 
too 
hot 
, 
not 
too 
cold 
, 
just 
warm 
and 
comfortable 
. 
after 
a 
few 
drops 
of 
the 
bath 
liquid 
, 
bubbles 
filled RelNScrEv_bath
the 
tub 
as 
the 
floral 
aroma 
filled RelNScrEv_bath
the 
air 
. 
i 
slowly 
took+off ScrEv_undress
the 
last 
of 
my 
garments 
, 
finally 
free 
from 
everything 
. 
i 
quickly 
grabbed ScrEv_prepare_bath
a 
glass 
of 
wine 
and 
when 
i 
returned RelNScrEv_bath
, 
the 
tub 
was UnrelEv_bath
full 
and 
ready 
. 
i 
slipped ScrEv_sink_water
into 
the 
tub 
and 
soaked ScrEv_sink_water
in 
the 
bliss 
. 
i 
lounged ScrEv_relax
for 
what 
seemed 
like 
hours 
. 
before 
i 
knew UnrelEv_bath
it 
, 
the 
wine 
was 
gone UnrelEv_bath
and 
i 
was 
starting UnrelEv_bath
to 
prune RelNScrEv_bath
. 
my 
bath 
was 
done UnrelEv_bath
. 
i 
got+out ScrEv_get_out_bath
and 
dried ScrEv_dry
the 
last 
of 
the 
relaxing RelNScrEv_bath
water 
off 
of 
my 
body 
as 
the 
last 
of 
the 
bath 
went+down RelNScrEv_bath
the 
drain 
. 
though 
my 
bath 
was UnrelEv_bath
over 
, 
i 
felt 
the 
relaxing RelNScrEv_bath
affects 
for 
hours 
. 
<end_of_story>_bath 
last 
night 
i 
decided UnrelEv_bath
to 
take+a+bath Evoking_bath
instead 
of 
a 
shower 
. 
i 
made+sure UnrelEv_bath
to 
put ScrEv_close_drain
the 
stopper 
in 
the 
bathtub 
, 
so 
no 
water 
would 
drain+out RelNScrEv_bath
. 
then 
i 
adjusted ScrEv_check_temp
the 
water 
temperature 
so 
it 
was UnrelEv_bath
n't 
too 
hot 
, 
or 
too 
cold 
, 
then 
let UnrelEv_bath
the 
bathtub 
fill ScrEv_fill_water/wait
all 
the 
way 
up 
to 
the 
top 
. 
i 
then 
gathered ScrEv_take_clean_clothes
up 
my 
pajamas 
to 
put+on RelNScrEv_bath
after 
the 
bath 
was UnrelEv_bath
over 
. 
i 
got ScrEv_prepare_bath
a 
clean 
towel 
, 
and 
brought ScrEv_prepare_bath
everything 
into 
the 
bathroom 
. 
i 
checked ScrEv_check_temp
the 
water 
temperature 
, 
took ScrEv_undress
all 
my 
clothes 
off 
, 
and 
jumped ScrEv_sink_water
right 
in 
. 
i 
lounged ScrEv_relax
around 
in 
the 
tub 
for 
awhile 
, 
then 
soaped ScrEv_apply_soap
up 
my 
hair 
and 
rinsed ScrEv_wash
it 
off 
. 
then 
i 
cleaned ScrEv_wash
my 
body 
with 
a 
bar 
of 
soap 
until 
i 
had UnrelEv_bath
every 
single 
part 
clean 
. 
at 
this 
point 
the 
water 
was 
starting UnrelEv_bath
to 
get RelNScrEv_bath
a 
bit 
cold 
, 
so 
i 
decided UnrelEv_bath
it 
was UnrelEv_bath
time 
to 
get+out ScrEv_get_out_bath
. 
i 
pulled ScrEv_open_drain
the 
water 
stopper 
so 
the 
water 
would 
drain+out RelNScrEv_bath
, 
then 
i 
dried ScrEv_dry
myself 
off 
with 
the 
towel 
, 
and 
got ScrEv_get_dressed
into 
my 
pajamas 
. 
<end_of_story>_bath 
after 
a 
long 
day 
at 
work 
, 
the 
thing 
i 
want UnrelEv_bath
and 
love UnrelEv_bath
the 
most 
is 
a 
hot 
bath 
. 
i 
like UnrelEv_bath
to 
run RelNScrEv_bath
the 
water 
very 
hot 
! 
i 
like UnrelEv_bath
bubbles 
added ScrEv_put_bubble_bath_scent
, 
the 
kind 
that 
smell UnrelEv_bath
like 
mangoes 
. 
i 
pour ScrEv_prepare_bath
a 
glass 
of 
wine 
while 
the 
water 
runs RelNScrEv_bath
, 
and 
bring UnrelEv_bath
it 
with 
me 
into 
the 
bathroom 
. 
once 
the 
tub 
is UnrelEv_bath
full 
, 
i 
finally 
allow UnrelEv_bath
myself 
to 
get+in ScrEv_sink_water
. 
ah 
, 
perfect 
! 
i 
lay+back ScrEv_relax
and 
let UnrelEv_bath
the 
hours 
of 
work 
just 
slip+away UnrelEv_bath
. 
sometimes 
i 
'll 
bring ScrEv_prepare_bath
a 
book 
in 
with 
me 
and 
sink+into UnrelEv_bath
a 
good 
story 
as 
the 
hot 
water 
dulls+away RelNScrEv_bath
any 
aches 
and 
pains 
. 
i 
sip RelNScrEv_bath
on 
my 
wine 
and 
enjoy UnrelEv_bath
the 
soft 
popping RelNScrEv_bath
bubbles 
around 
me 
. 
when 
i 
have 
finally 
had UnrelEv_bath
enough 
, 
i 
'll 
slowly 
drain ScrEv_open_drain
the 
tub 
, 
and 
then 
get+up ScrEv_get_out_bath
and 
dry+off ScrEv_dry
with 
a 
huge 
fluffy 
towel 
. 
after 
taking+a+bath Evoking_bath
i 
always 
feel+refreshed UnrelEv_bath
and 
relaxed UnrelEv_bath
! 
<end_of_story>_bath 
i 
returned UnrelEv_bath
to 
my 
home 
one 
evening 
after 
a 
long 
day 
of 
hiking UnrelEv_bath
and 
exploring UnrelEv_bath
the 
outdoors 
. 
i 
had UnrelEv_bath
dirt 
caked UnrelEv_bath
on 
my 
legs 
and 
grass 
stains 
on 
my 
knees 
, 
so 
i 
needed 
to 
clean+myself+up Evoking_bath
before 
getting UnrelEv_bath
into 
bed 
. 
i 
got ScrEv_prepare_bath
a 
towel 
and 
washcloth 
from 
my 
linen 
closet 
and 
brought ScrEv_prepare_bath
them 
into 
my 
bathroom 
. 
i 
turned+on ScrEv_turn_water_on
both 
the 
hot 
and 
cold 
knobs 
in 
the 
bathtub 
and 
let UnrelEv_bath
the 
water 
run RelNScrEv_bath
for 
a 
few 
moments 
before 
i 
put UnrelEv_bath
my 
hand 
under 
it 
to 
test ScrEv_check_temp
the 
temperature 
. 
i 
turned RelNScrEv_bath
each 
knob 
until 
the 
water 
felt UnrelEv_bath
warm 
and 
comfortable 
. 
then 
i 
plugged ScrEv_close_drain
the 
drain 
and 
undressed ScrEv_undress
, 
putting ScrEv_other_bath
my 
dirty 
clothes 
in 
the 
hamper 
. 
once 
the 
bathtub 
was UnrelEv_bath
about 
halfway 
full 
, 
i 
turned+off ScrEv_turn_water_off
the 
water 
and 
carefully 
sat+down ScrEv_sink_water
in 
the 
tub 
. 
i 
took UnrelEv_bath
some 
soap 
from 
the 
dish 
and 
rubbed ScrEv_apply_soap
it 
on 
the 
washcloth 
, 
then 
scrubbed ScrEv_wash
my 
dirty 
legs 
until 
the 
mud 
and 
grass 
disappeared UnrelEv_bath
. 
i 
let UnrelEv_bath
the 
water 
rinse ScrEv_wash
away 
the 
soap 
. 
once 
i 
felt UnrelEv_bath
clean 
, 
i 
stepped+out ScrEv_get_out_bath
of 
the 
tub 
and 
wrapped ScrEv_other_bath
a 
towel 
around 
myself 
to 
dry+off ScrEv_dry
. 
then 
i 
pulled ScrEv_open_drain
the 
plug 
out 
of 
the 
drain 
and 
let UnrelEv_bath
the 
water 
disappear UnrelEv_bath
down 
the 
pipes 
. 
as 
the 
tub 
was 
draining RelNScrEv_bath
, 
i 
dried ScrEv_dry
myself 
completely 
with 
the 
towel 
and 
put+on ScrEv_get_dressed
pajamas 
. 
i 
hung+up ScrEv_other_bath
my 
wet 
towel 
and 
washcloth 
and 
was UnrelEv_bath
ready 
to 
go UnrelEv_bath
to 
bed 
, 
all 
clean 
from 
the 
bath 
. 
<end_of_story>_bath 
last 
night 
i 
had UnrelEv_bath
plans 
to 
go+out UnrelEv_bath
to 
dinner 
with 
some 
friends 
. 
i 
arrived UnrelEv_bath
home 
from 
work 
and 
began 
to 
get+ready UnrelEv_bath
to 
go+out UnrelEv_bath
. 
i 
gathered ScrEv_prepare_bath
a 
towel 
and 
my 
robe 
and 
headed UnrelEv_bath
to 
the 
bathroom 
. 
i 
had UnrelEv_bath
plenty 
of 
time 
so 
i 
decided UnrelEv_bath
to 
take+a+nice+long+bath RelNScrEv_bath
. 
i 
put ScrEv_close_drain
the 
stopper 
in 
the 
drain 
and 
adjusted ScrEv_check_temp
the 
temperature 
of 
the 
water 
. 
i 
allowed UnrelEv_bath
the 
tub 
to 
fill ScrEv_fill_water/wait
about 
two-thirds 
of 
the 
way 
full 
and 
stepped ScrEv_sink_water
inside 
. 
i 
sank ScrEv_sink_water
into 
the 
warm 
water 
with 
a 
sigh 
. 
the 
water 
felt UnrelEv_bath
great 
and 
helped UnrelEv_bath
me 
relax ScrEv_relax
. 
i 
grabbed UnrelEv_bath
a 
wash 
cloth 
from 
the 
side 
of 
the 
tub 
and 
rubbed ScrEv_apply_soap
the 
soap 
against 
the 
cloth 
. 
i 
worked ScrEv_apply_soap
it 
into 
a 
rich 
lather 
and 
preceded UnrelEv_bath
to 
wash ScrEv_wash
my 
entire 
body 
from 
the 
head 
down 
. 
i 
then 
rinsed ScrEv_wash
myself 
well 
, 
stood UnrelEv_bath
up 
, 
and 
carefully 
stepped+out ScrEv_get_out_bath
of 
the 
tub 
. 
the 
bath 
had 
refreshed UnrelEv_bath
me 
and 
i 
was UnrelEv_bath
ready 
for 
a 
night 
out 
. 
<end_of_story>_bath 
last 
night 
i 
decided UnrelEv_bath
to 
take+a+bath Evoking_bath
. 
i 
had 
been 
outside 
playing UnrelEv_bath
all 
day 
and 
was UnrelEv_bath
really 
dirty 
. 
i 
started UnrelEv_bath
running RelNScrEv_bath
the 
warm 
water 
to 
fill ScrEv_fill_water/wait
the 
bathtub 
. 
i 
like UnrelEv_bath
the 
tub 
to 
be UnrelEv_bath
very 
full 
. 
while 
it 
was 
filling ScrEv_fill_water/wait
, 
i 
gathered ScrEv_prepare_bath
everything 
i 
would 
need UnrelEv_bath
for 
my 
bath 
. 
i 
got ScrEv_prepare_bath
my 
soap 
, 
shampoo 
, 
washcloth 
and 
towel 
. 
i 
also 
brought ScrEv_prepare_bath
my 
clean 
bathrobe 
into 
the 
bathroom 
and 
hung ScrEv_prepare_bath
it 
on 
the 
hook 
by 
the 
door 
. 
when 
the 
tub 
was UnrelEv_bath
full 
i 
got+in ScrEv_sink_water
and 
just 
soaked RelNScrEv_bath
for 
about 
ten 
minutes 
. 
then 
i 
put ScrEv_other_bath
shampoo 
in 
my 
hair 
and 
scrubbed RelNScrEv_bath
it 
until 
it 
was 
covered UnrelEv_bath
in 
bubbles 
. 
i 
rinsed ScrEv_wash
it 
off 
and 
then 
used UnrelEv_bath
the 
washcloth 
and 
soap 
to 
wash ScrEv_wash
my 
body 
. 
when 
i 
was UnrelEv_bath
all 
clean 
i 
got+out ScrEv_get_out_bath
and 
dried ScrEv_dry
myself 
really 
well 
with 
the 
soft 
, 
dry 
towel 
. 
i 
put+on ScrEv_get_dressed
my 
bathrobe 
and 
let 
let ScrEv_open_drain
the 
water 
out 
of 
the 
tub 
. 
it 
felt UnrelEv_bath
good 
to 
be 
all 
clean 
. 
<end_of_story>_bath 
every 
night 
before 
putting UnrelEv_bath
my 
son 
to 
bed 
he 
gets+his+bath Evoking_bath
. 
we 
go ScrEv_enter_bathroom
up 
to 
the 
bathroom 
and 
i 
start ScrEv_turn_water_on
the 
water 
and 
add ScrEv_put_bubble_bath_scent
his 
favorite 
bubbles 
. 
after 
he 
is 
undressed ScrEv_undress
he 
stands UnrelEv_bath
next 
to 
the 
tub 
and 
giggles UnrelEv_bath
and 
dances+watching UnrelEv_bath
the 
running RelNScrEv_bath
water 
create UnrelEv_bath
a 
mass 
of 
bubbles 
! 
i 
make+sure UnrelEv_bath
the 
water 
is UnrelEv_bath
warm 
enough 
, 
because 
his 
baths 
tend UnrelEv_bath
to 
last RelNScrEv_bath
a 
bit 
longer 
than 
most 
. 
when 
the 
water 
is UnrelEv_bath
ready 
, 
he 
throws+in UnrelEv_bath
all 
his 
tub 
toys 
, 
lizards 
and 
dinosaurs 
, 
cups 
and 
cars 
. 
the 
cars 
are UnrelEv_bath
his 
under 
water 
taxi 
's 
for 
the 
fish 
, 
he 
says UnrelEv_bath
. 
he 
sits ScrEv_sink_water
amiss 
the 
bubbles 
playing UnrelEv_bath
with 
his 
toys 
and 
laughing UnrelEv_bath
. 
we 
do UnrelEv_bath
the 
toe 
test 
, 
which 
is 
when 
i 
look UnrelEv_bath
at 
his 
toes 
and 
if 
they 
are 
wrinkle UnrelEv_bath
then 
time 
is UnrelEv_bath
up 
. 
yup 
toes 
are 
wrinkled UnrelEv_bath
, 
he 
laughs UnrelEv_bath
as 
wash ScrEv_wash
his 
body 
and 
hair 
. 
i 
let ScrEv_open_drain
the 
water 
out 
as 
he 
sits UnrelEv_bath
there 
and 
waits UnrelEv_bath
for 
the 
tub 
to 
empty RelNScrEv_bath
, 
only 
then 
does 
he 
want UnrelEv_bath
to 
get+out ScrEv_get_out_bath
. 
he 
helps UnrelEv_bath
to 
dry ScrEv_dry
himself 
off 
and 
put ScrEv_get_dressed
his 
pajamas 
on 
. 
now 
it 
is UnrelEv_bath
time 
for 
bed

<end_of_story>_bath 
everyone 
knows UnrelEv_bath
that 
cleanliness 
is 
close 
to 
godliness 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_bath
this 
mind 
frame 
that 
led UnrelEv_bath
me 
to 
take+my+third+bath+of+the+day Evoking_bath
a 
few 
minutes 
ago 
. 
i 
had 
decided UnrelEv_bath
to 
go UnrelEv_bath
outside 
and 
shoot UnrelEv_bath
my 
assault 
rifle 
and 
do UnrelEv_bath
some 
pistol 
drills 
since 
it 
was UnrelEv_bath
such 
a 
warm 
and 
beautiful 
day 
outside 
. 
the 
sweat 
started+coming UnrelEv_bath
from 
my 
body 
as 
i 
trained UnrelEv_bath
hard 
and 
the 
spent UnrelEv_bath
gunpowder 
began UnrelEv_bath
to 
cling UnrelEv_bath
to 
my 
sweat 
moistened UnrelEv_bath
skin 
. 
soon 
i 
was UnrelEv_bath
rather 
stinky 
and 
covered UnrelEv_bath
in 
gun 
powder 
. 
time 
to 
go UnrelEv_bath
inside 
, 
clean UnrelEv_bath
my 
weapons 
and 
prepare ScrEv_prepare_bath
a 
good 
hot 
bath 
. 
not 
just 
any 
bath 
but 
one 
that 
is UnrelEv_bath
piping 
hot 
and 
with 
bubbles 
in 
it 
. 
i 
removed ScrEv_undress
my 
clothing 
and 
carefully 
put ScrEv_sink_water
one 
foot 
in 
the 
hot 
water 
. 
ouch 
! 
very 
hot 
just 
the 
way 
i 
like UnrelEv_bath
it 
. 
i 
eased ScrEv_sink_water
my 
body 
into 
the 
tub 
, 
lit UnrelEv_bath
a 
cigarette 
and 
soaked UnrelEv_bath
away 
the 
fatigue 
of 
my 
previous 
workout 
. 
<end_of_story>_bath 
the 
long 
awaited UnrelEv_bath
bath 
i 
had 
been UnrelEv_bath
outside 
working UnrelEv_bath
in 
my 
garden 
all 
day 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_bath
warm 
and 
humid 
outside 
so 
besides 
being 
caked UnrelEv_bath
in 
dirt 
, 
i 
also 
had 
sweated UnrelEv_bath
a 
lot 
and 
did 
not 
smell UnrelEv_bath
very 
good 
. 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_bath
to 
get 
everything 
done UnrelEv_bath
in 
one 
day 
so 
i 
had 
worked UnrelEv_bath
very 
hard 
for 
a 
very 
long 
time 
. 
however 
, 
when 
i 
went UnrelEv_bath
inside 
to 
clean+up Evoking_bath
, 
i 
realized UnrelEv_bath
from 
an 
automated UnrelEv_bath
message 
in 
my 
voice 
mail 
that 
the 
water 
had 
been 
shut+off UnrelEv_bath
temporarily 
for 
emergency 
repairs 
, 
it 
would 
be+on UnrelEv_bath
again 
in 
a 
few 
hours 
. 
i 
was 
frustrated UnrelEv_bath
, 
but 
i 
decided UnrelEv_bath
that 
i 
was UnrelEv_bath
hungry 
as 
well 
so 
i 
made UnrelEv_bath
myself 
a 
sandwich 
and 
cut+up UnrelEv_bath
some 
fruit 
to 
eat UnrelEv_bath
. 
i 
took+off ScrEv_undress
my 
dirty 
clothes 
and 
put ScrEv_other_bath
them 
in 
the 
hamper 
and 
put 
on 
a 
clean 
t-shirt 
and 
shorts 
and 
then 
put+down UnrelEv_bath
an 
old 
blanket 
on 
my 
couch 
before 
i 
sat UnrelEv_bath
on 
it 
so 
i 
would 
not 
get UnrelEv_bath
it 
dirty 
. 
i 
watched UnrelEv_bath
part 
of 
a 
baseball 
game 
until 
i 
could 
not 
stand UnrelEv_bath
my 
own 
stench 
any 
more 
. 
i 
went UnrelEv_bath
to 
try UnrelEv_bath
the 
water 
in 
my 
bath 
tub 
and 
was UnrelEv_bath
extremely 
glad 
when 
it 
worked UnrelEv_bath
. 
i 
ran ScrEv_turn_water_on
myself 
a 
hot 
bath 
and 
put ScrEv_put_bubble_bath_scent
some 
bubble 
bath 
soap 
in 
it 
. 
i 
got+in ScrEv_sink_water
and 
found UnrelEv_bath
it 
very 
relaxing ScrEv_relax
. 
i 
was UnrelEv_bath
so 
glad 
to 
finally 
take+a+bath Evoking_bath
, 
get 
cleaned+up RelNScrEv_bath
, 
and 
relax ScrEv_relax
after 
a 
long 
, 
hard 
, 
productive 
day 
. 
<end_of_story>_bath 
i 
went ScrEv_enter_bathroom
inside 
the 
bathroom 
with 
my 
change 
of 
clothes 
and 
a 
towel 
. 
i 
put+in ScrEv_close_drain
the 
bath 
plug 
and 
turned+on ScrEv_turn_water_on
the 
hot 
water 
faucet 
to 
start 
filling+up ScrEv_fill_water/wait
the 
bathtub 
. 
i 
waited ScrEv_fill_water/wait
a 
few 
minutes 
for 
the 
tub 
to 
fill+up ScrEv_fill_water/wait
, 
and 
then 
added ScrEv_put_bubble_bath_scent
bath 
soap 
to 
the 
tub 
. 
i 
undressed ScrEv_undress
, 
and 
stepped+into ScrEv_sink_water
the 
bathtub 
which 
was 
filled RelNScrEv_bath
with 
bubbles 
. 
i 
laid+down ScrEv_sink_water
in 
the 
tub 
and 
relaxed ScrEv_relax
for 
a 
few 
minutes 
and 
thought UnrelEv_bath
about 
my 
day 
. 
then 
, 
i 
used ScrEv_wash
a 
loofah 
to 
scrub RelNScrEv_bath
all 
over 
my 
body 
until 
i 
was UnrelEv_bath
clean 
. 
i 
turned+on ScrEv_turn_water_on
the 
hot 
water 
again 
and 
filled+up ScrEv_other_bath
a 
cup 
with 
the 
hot 
water 
and 
poured ScrEv_wash
it 
onto 
my 
hair 
. 
i 
used UnrelEv_bath
one 
squirt 
of 
shampoo 
and 
rubbed ScrEv_other_bath
it 
into 
my 
hair 
until 
i 
made UnrelEv_bath
suds 
. 
then 
i 
rinsed ScrEv_wash
my 
hair 
out 
again 
with 
a 
cup 
of 
hot 
water 
. 
i 
removed ScrEv_open_drain
the 
plug 
from 
the 
bottom 
of 
the 
tub 
and 
stood+up UnrelEv_bath
while 
the 
water 
drained RelNScrEv_bath
. 
i 
rinsed ScrEv_wash
my 
body 
off 
with 
a 
few 
more 
cups 
of 
hot 
water 
until 
i 
was UnrelEv_bath
n't 
soapy 
anymore 
. 
then 
i 
grabbed ScrEv_get_towel
my 
towel 
off 
of 
a 
shelf 
next 
to 
the 
tub 
and 
used UnrelEv_bath
it 
to 
dry ScrEv_dry
myself 
off 
. 
i 
stepped+out ScrEv_get_out_bath
of 
the 
tub 
onto 
the 
bath 
room 
carpet 
and 
changed ScrEv_get_dressed
into 
my 
clothes 
. 
<end_of_story>_bath 
i 
had 
been UnrelEv_bath
outside 
playing UnrelEv_bath
basketball 
for 
several 
hours 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_bath
a 
hot 
day 
and 
i 
got UnrelEv_bath
quite 
sweaty 
and 
dirty 
. 
i 
was UnrelEv_bath
sort 
from 
so 
much 
activity 
and 
just 
walked UnrelEv_bath
through 
my 
front 
door 
. 
the 
first 
thing 
i 
did UnrelEv_bath
when 
i 
got UnrelEv_bath
to 
my 
bathroom 
was 
disrobe ScrEv_undress
and 
started UnrelEv_bath
the 
warm 
water 
-- 
i 
was 
going 
to 
prepare ScrEv_prepare_bath
a 
bath 
to 
soak+in UnrelEv_bath
it 
and 
relax ScrEv_relax
my 
sore 
muscles 
from 
so 
much 
activity 
while 
also 
cleaning ScrEv_wash
the 
sweat 
and 
grime 
from 
myself 
from 
working UnrelEv_bath
up 
such 
a 
sweat 
. 
the 
water 
filled ScrEv_fill_water/wait
the 
bath 
and 
i 
got+in ScrEv_sink_water
and 
sat UnrelEv_bath
in 
the 
warm 
water 
for 
the 
better 
part 
of 
an 
hour 
, 
enjoying UnrelEv_bath
the 
relaxing ScrEv_relax
bath 
as 
the 
ache 
and 
tiredness 
in 
my 
muscles 
washed+away UnrelEv_bath
. 
i 
cleaned ScrEv_wash
my 
hair 
with 
some 
shampoo 
and 
washed ScrEv_wash
my 
body 
with 
a 
washcloth 
and 
rinsed+off ScrEv_wash
with 
the 
shower 
head 
as 
i 
was 
finishing+up UnrelEv_bath
. 
i 
dried+off ScrEv_dry
and 
sat UnrelEv_bath
on 
the 
couch 
for 
hours 
later 
. 
<end_of_story>_bath 
i 
was 
tired UnrelEv_bath
from 
a 
long 
day 
of 
baseball 
practice 
and 
could 
not 
wait UnrelEv_bath
to 
take+a+bath Evoking_bath
. 
i 
was UnrelEv_bath
pretty 
muddy 
from 
sliding UnrelEv_bath
into 
home 
plate 
and 
scoring UnrelEv_bath
the 
winning 
run 
. 
i 
went ScrEv_enter_bathroom
into 
the 
bathroom 
and 
started UnrelEv_bath
running ScrEv_fill_water/wait
the 
water 
in 
the 
bathtub 
. 
i 
put ScrEv_turn_water_on
the 
hot 
and 
cold 
faucets 
both 
on 
to 
make+sure UnrelEv_bath
the 
water 
was UnrelEv_bath
warm 
but 
not 
too 
hot 
. 
after 
the 
tub 
filled+up ScrEv_fill_water/wait
a 
little 
over 
the 
halfway 
point 
i 
got ScrEv_sink_water
into 
the 
bath 
. 
i 
had UnrelEv_bath
some 
bubble 
bath 
shampoo 
with 
me 
so 
i 
put ScrEv_put_bubble_bath_scent
that 
into 
the 
water 
and 
had UnrelEv_bath
fun 
playing RelNScrEv_bath
with 
the 
bubbles 
. 
i 
washed ScrEv_wash
the 
soapy 
water 
all 
over 
my 
body 
and 
felt UnrelEv_bath
clean 
and 
refreshed 
. 
after 
about 
ten 
minutes 
i 
turned ScrEv_turn_water_off
the 
water 
off 
and 
grabbed ScrEv_get_towel
a 
nearby 
towel 
. 
i 
toweled ScrEv_dry
off 
and 
put ScrEv_other_bath
my 
dirty 
clothes 
in 
the 
laundry 
basket 
. 
i 
was UnrelEv_bath
ready 
for 
another 
nine 
innings 
of 
baseball 
. 
<end_of_story>_bath 
after 
making UnrelEv_bath
the 
decision 
to 
take+a+bath Evoking_bath
, 
i 
began UnrelEv_bath
to 
prepare ScrEv_prepare_bath
. 
i 
started UnrelEv_bath
by 
getting+out ScrEv_prepare_bath
my 
bubble 
bath 
, 
several 
candles 
, 
and 
a 
book 
to 
read UnrelEv_bath
. 
i 
placed ScrEv_prepare_bath
candles 
all 
around 
the 
perimeter 
of 
the 
tub 
and 
began UnrelEv_bath
to 
light ScrEv_prepare_bath
them 
. 
after 
all 
the 
candles 
were 
lit ScrEv_prepare_bath
, 
i 
started ScrEv_turn_water_on
the 
tub 
's 
water 
and 
adjusted RelNScrEv_bath
it 
to 
the 
appropriate 
temperature 
that 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_bath
. 
i 
then 
placed ScrEv_close_drain
the 
stopper 
in 
the 
drain 
and 
added ScrEv_put_bubble_bath_scent
a 
substantial 
amount 
of 
bubble 
bath 
to 
the 
water 
. 
after 
the 
tub 
was 
filled ScrEv_fill_water/wait
, 
i 
shut+off ScrEv_turn_water_off
the 
water 
and 
began UnrelEv_bath
to 
disrobe ScrEv_undress
. 
after 
removing ScrEv_undress
my 
clothing 
, 
i 
took+hold UnrelEv_bath
of 
my 
book 
and 
settled ScrEv_sink_water
in 
to 
the 
tub 
to 
soak RelNScrEv_bath
and 
relax ScrEv_relax
for 
awhile 
. 
i 
read UnrelEv_bath
my 
book 
until 
the 
water 
began UnrelEv_bath
to 
get UnrelEv_bath
cold 
. 
i 
then 
took UnrelEv_bath
a 
few 
minutes 
to 
make+sure UnrelEv_bath
i 
was UnrelEv_bath
clean 
, 
scrubbing ScrEv_wash
myself 
all 
over 
. 
after 
that 
was UnrelEv_bath
complete 
, 
i 
removed ScrEv_open_drain
the 
stopper 
to 
drain RelNScrEv_bath
the 
water 
, 
blew+out UnrelEv_bath
the 
candles 
, 
and 
climbed+out ScrEv_get_out_bath
of 
the 
tub 
. 
i 
then 
toweled+off ScrEv_dry
and 
put+on ScrEv_get_dressed
my 
bath 
robe 
. 
<end_of_story>_bath 
i 
spent UnrelEv_bath
most 
of 
the 
afternoon 
gardening UnrelEv_bath
, 
and 
was UnrelEv_bath
close 
to 
covered UnrelEv_bath
with 
dirt 
. 
i 
reached UnrelEv_bath
a 
point 
that 
i 
was UnrelEv_bath
satisfied 
with 
, 
and 
decided UnrelEv_bath
to 
leave UnrelEv_bath
the 
rest 
of 
the 
work 
for 
the 
next 
day 
. 
after 
taking+off UnrelEv_bath
my 
mud-encrusted 
boots 
, 
i 
tiptoed ScrEv_enter_bathroom
towards 
the 
bathroom 
, 
where 
i 
knew UnrelEv_bath
a 
relaxing RelNScrEv_bath
bath 
was 
in 
my 
future 
. 
i 
drew ScrEv_turn_water_on
the 
water 
as 
hot 
as 
i 
could 
, 
and 
quickly 
filled ScrEv_fill_water/wait
the 
tub 
halfway 
with 
water 
. 
i 
stripped ScrEv_undress
my 
clothes 
, 
first 
taking+off ScrEv_undress
me 
pants 
, 
then 
my 
shirt 
, 
socks 
, 
and 
underwear 
. 
two 
drops 
of 
lavender 
oil 
and 
two 
cups 
of 
epsom 
salt 
is UnrelEv_bath
what 
i 
put ScrEv_put_bubble_bath_scent
into 
the 
tub 
, 
balancing+out ScrEv_other_bath
the 
temperature 
with 
cold 
water 
until 
it 
was UnrelEv_bath
just 
perfect 
. 
i 
slowly 
dipped ScrEv_other_bath
my 
foot 
into 
the 
tub 
, 
and 
found UnrelEv_bath
the 
feeling 
spectacular 
. 
i 
slowly 
sunk ScrEv_sink_water
the 
rest 
of 
my 
body 
, 
and 
closed UnrelEv_bath
my 
eyes 
in 
a 
breath 
of 
sweet 
relief 
. 
<end_of_story>_bath 
i 
took+a+warm+bath Evoking_bath
this 
evening 
to 
relax ScrEv_relax
. 
i 
began UnrelEv_bath
by 
drawing RelNScrEv_bath
myself 
a 
bath 
. 
i 
turned ScrEv_turn_water_on
the 
water 
on 
and 
made+sure UnrelEv_bath
that 
the 
temperature 
was UnrelEv_bath
not 
too 
hot 
and 
not 
too 
cold 
. 
in 
the 
meantime 
, 
i 
removed ScrEv_undress
all 
of 
my 
clothes 
to 
prepare ScrEv_prepare_bath
for 
my 
bath 
. 
i 
turned ScrEv_turn_water_off
the 
water 
off 
when 
it 
looked UnrelEv_bath
like 
i 
filled ScrEv_fill_water/wait
the 
tub 
high 
enough 
. 
i 
then 
got+in ScrEv_sink_water
and 
laid+down UnrelEv_bath
on 
my 
back 
, 
allowing UnrelEv_bath
my 
lower 
body 
to 
soak RelNScrEv_bath
. 
i 
used UnrelEv_bath
a 
small 
towel 
as 
a 
cushion 
for 
my 
head 
. 
i 
moved UnrelEv_bath
my 
arms 
and 
legs 
slowly 
around 
in 
the 
water 
, 
almost 
as 
if 
i 
were 
swimming UnrelEv_bath
. 
i 
would 
occasionally 
lift ScrEv_other_bath
my 
feet 
up 
to 
the 
top 
of 
the 
bathtub 
to 
get UnrelEv_bath
a 
nice 
stretch 
. 
i 
used UnrelEv_bath
soap 
and 
a 
washcloth 
to 
get ScrEv_wash
clean 
. 
i 
applied ScrEv_apply_soap
the 
soap 
to 
the 
washcloth 
, 
then 
rubbed ScrEv_wash
the 
cloth 
all 
over 
my 
body 
. 
i 
enjoyed UnrelEv_bath
the 
warmth 
of 
my 
bath 
for 
fifteen 
minutes 
, 
then 
i 
drained ScrEv_open_drain
the 
water 
. 
i 
used UnrelEv_bath
my 
towel 
to 
dry ScrEv_dry
myself 
off 
. 
finally 
, 
i 
put ScrEv_get_dressed
my 
clothes 
back 
on 
. 
<end_of_story>_bath 
every 
morning 
i 
take+a+bath Evoking_bath

get RelNScrEv_bath
into 
the

tub 
, 
i 
turn+on ScrEv_turn_water_on
the 
water 
. 
i 
adjust ScrEv_check_temp
the 
cold 
and 
the 
hot 
water 
to 
make UnrelEv_bath
a 
bearable UnrelEv_bath
temperature 
. 
i 
adjust ScrEv_check_temp
the 
water 
before 
entering ScrEv_sink_water
the 
tub 
so 
i 
wo 
n't 
burn RelNScrEv_bath
or 
freeze RelNScrEv_bath
myself 
. 
after 
the 
water 
is UnrelEv_bath
just 
right 
, 
i 
take+off ScrEv_undress
all 
my

all 
over 
my

, 
i 
take UnrelEv_bath
my 
loofah 
sponge 
and 
pour ScrEv_apply_soap
soap 
on 
that 
as 
well 
. 
i 
, 
then 
, 
begin UnrelEv_bath
to 
scrub ScrEv_other_bath
my 
body 
as 
firm 
but 
gently 
as 
i 
can UnrelEv_bath
. 
i 
do UnrelEv_bath
this 
to 
ensure UnrelEv_bath
that 
all 
the 
dirt 
washes+off RelNScrEv_bath
my 
skin 
. 
while 
i 
am 
scrubbing ScrEv_other_bath
my 
body 
, 
i 
like 
to 
sing ScrEv_other_bath
in 
the 
shower 
. 
after 
i 
scrub ScrEv_other_bath
really 
good 
and 
finish UnrelEv_bath
singing ScrEv_other_bath
, 
i 
pour ScrEv_other_bath
water 
continuously 
on 
my

until 
all 
the

for 
about 
twenty 
minutes 
until 
i 
feel UnrelEv_bath
clean 
. 
<end_of_story>_bath 
after

i 
went ScrEv_enter_bathroom
into 
the

grabbed ScrEv_get_towel
my 
towel 
and 
dried ScrEv_dry
myself 
off 
. 
then 
i 
put+on ScrEv_get_dressed
some 
clean 
clothes 
and 
blow 
dried ScrEv_dry
my 
hair 
. 
<end_of_story>_bath 
it 
first 
begins UnrelEv_bath
with 
turning+on ScrEv_other_bath
the 
heater 
in 
the 
bathroom 
for 
523 
minutes 
so 
that 
when 
i 
am 
waiting ScrEv_fill_water/wait
for 
the 
water 
to 
be UnrelEv_bath
warm 
i 
do 
not 
freeze UnrelEv_bath
. 
my 
parents 
and 
siblings 
think UnrelEv_bath
that 
this 
is UnrelEv_bath
weird 
but 
i 
do 
not 
care UnrelEv_bath
because 
it 
is UnrelEv_bath
my 
way 
of 
doing UnrelEv_bath
things 
. 
i 
look+forward UnrelEv_bath
to 
a 
warm 
bath 
and 
enjoy UnrelEv_bath
getting RelNScrEv_bath
clean 
and 
soaking RelNScrEv_bath
afterwards 
to 
relax ScrEv_relax
. 
once 
the 
bath 
is UnrelEv_bath
full 
i 
slowly 
get+in ScrEv_sink_water
and 
feel UnrelEv_bath
the 
warmth 
wrap UnrelEv_bath
around 
my 
body 
. 
after 
getting UnrelEv_bath
comfy 
i 
close UnrelEv_bath
my 
eyes 
and 
relax ScrEv_relax
for 
523 
or 
523 
minutes 
before 
beginning UnrelEv_bath
to 
get ScrEv_wash
clean 
and 
proceed UnrelEv_bath
to 
get+out ScrEv_get_out_bath
. 
after 
cleaning ScrEv_wash
i 
do 
not 
like UnrelEv_bath
to 
relax ScrEv_relax
any 
longer 
because 
you 
are 
basically 
sitting UnrelEv_bath
in 
your 
dirt 
, 
grime 
, 
and 
filth 
. 
this 
is UnrelEv_bath
quite 
disgusting UnrelEv_bath
to 
think+about UnrelEv_bath
and 
i 
would 
not 
ever 
recommend UnrelEv_bath
anyone 
to 
rest ScrEv_relax
or 
relax ScrEv_relax
in 
the 
filth 
. 
no 
matter 
how 
warm 
or 
cozy 
the 
water 
still 
seems UnrelEv_bath
. 
<end_of_story>_bath 
i 
came+home UnrelEv_bath
after 
work 
and 
desperately 
needed+a+bath Evoking_bath
to 
unwind UnrelEv_bath
from 
the 
long 
day 
. 
so 
, 
i 
went UnrelEv_bath
to 
the 
hall 
closet 
and 
i 
pulled+out ScrEv_prepare_bath
my 
towel 
, 
various 
lotions 
, 
bath 
potions 
and 
scrubby 
and 
took ScrEv_prepare_bath
them 
into 
the 
bathroom 
. 
i 
sat ScrEv_prepare_bath
my 
stuff 
beside 
the 
tub 
and 
turned+on ScrEv_turn_water_on
the 
water 
to 
a 
nice 
, 
warm 
temperature 
and 
put ScrEv_close_drain
in 
the 
drain 
stopper 
. 
since 
i 
did 
n't 
want UnrelEv_bath
to 
get UnrelEv_bath
my 
hair 
wet 
, 
i 
brushed ScrEv_other_bath
it 
and 
put ScrEv_other_bath
it 
up 
in 
a 
bun 
. 
noticing UnrelEv_bath
that 
the 
tub 
was 
filling ScrEv_fill_water/wait
nicely 
, 
i 
added ScrEv_put_bubble_bath_scent
in 
my 
bath 
oil 
and 
got 
undressed ScrEv_undress
, 
folding ScrEv_other_bath
my 
clothes 
and 
setting ScrEv_other_bath
them 
on 
top 
of 
the 
closed UnrelEv_bath
hamper 
. 
the 
tub 
was UnrelEv_bath
full 
enough 
, 
so 
i 
turned+off ScrEv_turn_water_off
the 
water 
and 
slid ScrEv_sink_water
in 
. 
i 
washed ScrEv_wash
my 
body 
with 
my 
special 
soaps 
and 
my 
scrubby 
. 
rubbing ScrEv_other_bath
down 
my 
legs 
and 
arms 
felt UnrelEv_bath
pretty 
good 
and 
made 
the 
tub 
smell UnrelEv_bath
even 
nicer 
. 
i 
then 
sat+back UnrelEv_bath
and 
cleared 
my 
mind 
, 
letting UnrelEv_bath
my 
skin 
soak RelNScrEv_bath
in 
the 
oils 
. 
after 
i 
had 
relaxed ScrEv_relax
for 
a 
bit 
and 
the 
water 
started UnrelEv_bath
to 
cool RelNScrEv_bath
, 
i 
pulled ScrEv_open_drain
the 
drain 
plug 
and 
stood+up UnrelEv_bath
to 
grab ScrEv_get_towel
my 
towel 
and 
started UnrelEv_bath
to 
dry+off ScrEv_dry
. 
<end_of_story>_bath 
i 
took+a+bath Evoking_bath
for 
the 
first 
time 
in 
a 
long 
time 
last 
week 
. 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_bath
to 
be 
able 
to 
relax ScrEv_relax
and 
get RelNScrEv_bath
clean 
without 
all 
the 
work 
of 
standing+up UnrelEv_bath
to 
shower UnrelEv_bath
! 
first 
, 
i 
made+sure UnrelEv_bath
the 
bathtub 
was 
cleaned+out RelNScrEv_bath
. 
i 
then 
ran ScrEv_turn_water_on
the 
hot 
water 
first 
and 
filled+up ScrEv_fill_water/wait
most 
of 
the 
bathtub 
. 
i 
turned ScrEv_turn_water_off
the 
hot 
water 
off 
and 
then 
turned ScrEv_turn_water_on
the 
cold 
on 
, 
that 
way 
the 
temperature 
of 
the 
water 
was UnrelEv_bath
not 
too 
hot 
and 
not 
too 
cold 
, 
but 
just 
right 
. 
i 
got UnrelEv_bath
a 
book 
that 
i 
had 
been 
wanting UnrelEv_bath
to 
read UnrelEv_bath
and 
climbed+in ScrEv_sink_water
. 
after 
reading UnrelEv_bath
for 
awhile 
, 
i 
decided UnrelEv_bath
that 
it 
was UnrelEv_bath
time 
to 
wash+off ScrEv_wash
since 
the 
water 
was 
starting UnrelEv_bath
to 
cool+down RelNScrEv_bath
. 
i 
washed+off ScrEv_wash
my 
face 
and 
body 
, 
and 
then 
used UnrelEv_bath
shampoo 
and 
conditioner 
in 
my 
hair 
. 
when 
i 
was UnrelEv_bath
all 
done 
, 
i 
drained ScrEv_open_drain
the 
water 
from 
the 
tub 
and 
used UnrelEv_bath
the 
shower 
to 
rinse+off ScrEv_wash
. 
i 
dried ScrEv_dry
myself 
off 
with 
a 
big 
towel 
and 
put+on ScrEv_get_dressed
my 
pajamas 
so 
i 
would 
be UnrelEv_bath
comfortable 
. 
<end_of_story>_bath 
the 
first 
time 
i 
took+a+bath Evoking_bath
, 
i 
enjoyed UnrelEv_bath
it 
so 
much 
that 
i 
did 
not 
want UnrelEv_bath
to 
stop UnrelEv_bath
. 
it 
felt UnrelEv_bath
like 
i 
was 
sitting UnrelEv_bath
in 
a 
pool 
of 
warm 
water 
. 
i 
was UnrelEv_bath
a 
young 
kid 
so 
it 
was UnrelEv_bath
a 
bubble 
bath 
and 
i 
had UnrelEv_bath
some 
toys 
to 
play UnrelEv_bath
with 
. 
either 
my 
mother 
or 
my 
father 
would 
wash ScrEv_wash
my 
hair 
for 
me 
then 
they 
would 
help UnrelEv_bath
me 
wash ScrEv_wash
the 
remainder 
of 
my 
body 
. 
but 
they 
just 
told UnrelEv_bath
me 
not 
to 
splash RelNScrEv_bath
the 
water 
and 
to 
keep UnrelEv_bath
the 
water 
in 
the 
tub 
. 
i 
would 
play UnrelEv_bath
with 
my 
toys 
and 
get UnrelEv_bath
all 
clean 
in 
the 
bath 
tub 
. 
after 
a 
few 
years 
i 
learned UnrelEv_bath
how 
to 
wash ScrEv_wash
my 
own 
hair 
and 
i 
would 
prefer UnrelEv_bath
to 
take+a+bath Evoking_bath
over 
a 
shower 
since 
it 
was UnrelEv_bath
more 
fun 
to 
sit UnrelEv_bath
and 
relax ScrEv_relax
in 
the 
warm 
water 
and 
enjoy UnrelEv_bath
a 
fun 
evening 
. 
from 
the 
best 
of 
my 
memory 
, 
i 
remember UnrelEv_bath
that 
i 
always 
loved UnrelEv_bath
taking+a+bath Evoking_bath
. 
then 
when 
i 
am 
done UnrelEv_bath
in 
the 
bath 
tub 
, 
i 
would 
get+out ScrEv_get_out_bath
and 
wrap+up ScrEv_get_towel
in 
a 
huge 
dry 
cotton 
towel 
and 
dry+off ScrEv_dry
! 
<end_of_story>_bath 
after 
i 
planted UnrelEv_bath
a 
tree 
the 
other 
day 
, 
i 
was UnrelEv_bath
all 
dirty 
and 
tired 
. 
i 
decided UnrelEv_bath
for 
a 
change 
that 
instead 
of 
a 
shower 
i 
was 
going 
to 
have+a+bath Evoking_bath
tonight 
and 
relax ScrEv_relax
. 
first 
i 
moved ScrEv_prepare_bath
my 
soap 
and 
shampoo 
down 
to 
the 
side 
of 
the 
tub 
instead 
of 
on 
their 
normal 
shower 
shelf 
, 
then 
started ScrEv_turn_water_on
the 
water 
running RelNScrEv_bath
. 
once 
i 
got UnrelEv_bath
it 
hot 
, 
but 
not 
too 
hot 
, 
i 
closed ScrEv_close_drain
the 
drain 
so 
the 
tub 
would 
start 
to 
fill ScrEv_fill_water/wait
up 
. 
i 
had UnrelEv_bath
an 
idea 
at 
the 
last 
minute 
and 
grabbed UnrelEv_bath
my 
tablet 
and 
a 
ziploc 
bag 
and 
put UnrelEv_bath
the 
tablet 
inside 
it 
to 
protect UnrelEv_bath
it 
from 
splashes 
. 
i 
turned+up UnrelEv_bath
my 
stereo 
so 
i 
could 
head UnrelEv_bath
it 
in 
the 
bathroom 
, 
then 
got ScrEv_sink_water
into 
the 
tub 
. 
i 
settled UnrelEv_bath
into 
the 
warm 
water 
and 
relaxed ScrEv_relax
for 
a 
little 
while 
, 
then 
grabbed UnrelEv_bath
my 
tablet 
and 
started+reading UnrelEv_bath
a 
book 
. 
after 
about 
523 
minutes 
of 
relaxing ScrEv_relax
, 
i 
let ScrEv_other_bath
some 
of 
the 
water 
out 
since 
it 
was 
getting RelNScrEv_bath
cold 
, 
filled+up ScrEv_fill_water/wait
with 
more 
hot 
water 
and 
started UnrelEv_bath
washing ScrEv_wash
. 
once 
i 
was 
cleaned+off+, UnrelEv_bath
i 
opened ScrEv_open_drain
the 
drain 
and 
finished+up UnrelEv_bath
by 
washing ScrEv_wash
my 
hair 
under 
the 
shower 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_bath
a 
nice 
change 
from 
showering UnrelEv_bath
all 
the 
time 
. 
<end_of_story>_bath 
after 
a 
long 
day 
, 
nothing 
really 
relaxes ScrEv_relax
me 
like 
a 
long 
, 
soaking RelNScrEv_bath
bath 
. 
the 
entire 
activity 
for 
me 
is UnrelEv_bath
something 
i 
enjoy UnrelEv_bath
and 
start+looking+forward UnrelEv_bath
to 
before UnrelEv_bath
i 
've 
even 
left UnrelEv_bath
work 
. 
first 
i 
'll 
get UnrelEv_bath
home 
and 
start ScrEv_turn_water_on
the 
tub 
523 
i 
like UnrelEv_bath
the 
water 
to 
be UnrelEv_bath
hot 
to 
the 
point 
of 
nearly 
scalding 
, 
so 
i 
only 
add ScrEv_other_bath
a 
tiny 
bit 
of 
cold 
water 
. 
as 
the 
tub 
fills ScrEv_fill_water/wait
, 
i 
get+together ScrEv_prepare_bath
what 
i 
call UnrelEv_bath
my 
bath 
toys 
, 
which 
consist+of UnrelEv_bath
my 
kindle 
and 
an 
ice 
cold 
beer 
. 
when 
the 
tub 
is UnrelEv_bath
full 
i 
get ScrEv_prepare_bath
my 
favorite 
sweat 
pants 
and 
sweatshirt 
together 
and 
, 
after 
getting+undressed ScrEv_undress
, 
i 
slowly 
lower ScrEv_sink_water
myself 
into 
the 
tub 
, 
savoring UnrelEv_bath
every 
twitch 
as 
i 
lower ScrEv_sink_water
myself 
into 
the 
scalding 
water 
. 
once 
i 
'm 
settled UnrelEv_bath
, 
i 
crack+open UnrelEv_bath
my 
beer 
and 
then 
just 
enjoy UnrelEv_bath
the 
feeling 
of 
all 
of 
the 
tension 
leaving UnrelEv_bath
my 
muscles 
as 
i 
read UnrelEv_bath
. 
when 
the 
water 
cools+off RelNScrEv_bath
-lrb- 
this 
can 
take UnrelEv_bath
523 
minutes 
or 
more 
-rrb- 
i 
get+out ScrEv_get_out_bath
of 
the 
tub 
, 
dry+off ScrEv_dry
and 
get+dressed ScrEv_get_dressed
, 
but 
not 
without 
a 
slight 
feeling 
of 
disappointment 
that 
the 
experience 
has 
ended UnrelEv_bath
. 
<end_of_story>_bath 
a 
few 
weeks 
ago 
, 
i 
took+a+bath Evoking_bath
. 
i 
do 
not 
normally 
take+baths Evoking_bath
, 
instead 
i 
take UnrelEv_bath
showers 
, 
but 
i 
had UnrelEv_bath
the 
house 
to 
myself 
. 
my 
back 
was 
hurting UnrelEv_bath
and 
i 
wanted 
to 
relax ScrEv_relax
with 
some 
heat 
on 
it 
. 
i 
start+out UnrelEv_bath
cleaning+up ScrEv_other_bath
the 
bathtub 
. 
it 
is UnrelEv_bath
not 
dirty 
really 
, 
but 
i 
want UnrelEv_bath
the 
tub 
to 
be UnrelEv_bath
spotless 
if 
i 
am 
going 
to 
be 
taking+a+bath Evoking_bath
. 
i 
first 
took ScrEv_other_bath
a 
quick 
shower 
to 
get 
everything 
washed+off ScrEv_wash
and 
clean 
. 
i 
did 
n't 
want UnrelEv_bath
to 
sit UnrelEv_bath
in 
a 
tepid 
pool 
of 
my 
own 
fifth 
. 
after 
that 
was 
finished UnrelEv_bath
, 
i 
turned+on ScrEv_turn_water_on
the 
hot 
water 
and 
filled ScrEv_fill_water/wait
the 
tub 
. 
i 
like UnrelEv_bath
to 
have+a+really+hot+bath Evoking_bath
, 
because 
it 
generally 
gets RelNScrEv_bath
cold 
so 
quick 
. 
i 
found UnrelEv_bath
some 
of 
my 
daughter 
's 
bubble 
bath 
and 
added ScrEv_put_bubble_bath_scent
a 
pretty 
generous 
amount 
. 
i 
figured UnrelEv_bath
, 
hey 
, 
you 
have 
to 
treat UnrelEv_bath
yourself 
right 
. 
so 
, 
i 
got ScrEv_prepare_bath
it 
and 
folded ScrEv_prepare_bath
a 
towel 
for 
my 
head 
and 
laid+down ScrEv_sink_water
. 
i 
had UnrelEv_bath
a 
beer 
while 
i 
was 
relaxing ScrEv_relax
in 
the 
tub 
. 
my 
back 
was 
loosening+up UnrelEv_bath
and 
i 
was 
feeling UnrelEv_bath
better 
after 
about 
fifteen 
minutes 
. 
the 
water 
was 
getting RelNScrEv_bath
cold 
, 
so 
i 
decided UnrelEv_bath
to 
get+out ScrEv_get_out_bath
. 
i 
dried ScrEv_dry
off 
and 
got+dressed ScrEv_get_dressed
and 
i 
felt UnrelEv_bath
a 
lot 
better 
. 
<end_of_story>_bath 
a 
bath Evoking_bath
is UnrelEv_bath
an 
excellent 
way 
to 
relieve UnrelEv_bath
stress 
in 
your 
life 
. 
it 
's UnrelEv_bath
a 
very 
simple 
process 
and 
recommended UnrelEv_bath
only 
if 
you 
have UnrelEv_bath
some 
time 
to 
yourself 
. 
make 
sure 
to 
let 
everyone 
know UnrelEv_bath
that 
you 
are 
going 
to 
take+a+bath Evoking_bath
, 
and 
not 
to 
bother UnrelEv_bath
you 
. 
this 
works+out UnrelEv_bath
much 
better 
if 
you 
are UnrelEv_bath
home 
alone 
. 
head ScrEv_enter_bathroom
into 
your 
bathroom 
, 
and 
set ScrEv_close_drain
the 
tub 
up 
to 
stop UnrelEv_bath
the 
water 
from 
draining RelNScrEv_bath
. 
turn ScrEv_turn_water_on
the 
hot 
water 
on 
and 
let 
the 
tub 
fill ScrEv_fill_water/wait
up 
. 
if 
you 
would 
rather 
a 
cold 
bath Evoking_bath
then 
maybe 
a 
bath Evoking_bath
is UnrelEv_bath
n't 
the 
best 
choice 
for 
you 
. 
while 
the 
water 
is 
running ScrEv_fill_water/wait
make ScrEv_prepare_bath
yourself 
a 
nice 
drink 
but 
if 
you 
are UnrelEv_bath
underage 
then 
sparkling UnrelEv_bath
grape 
juice 
works UnrelEv_bath
great 
. 
you 
can 
also 
light ScrEv_prepare_bath
a 
candle 
and 
bring ScrEv_prepare_bath
it 
in 
with 
you 
. 
once 
the 
tub 
is ScrEv_fill_water/wait
full 
enter ScrEv_sink_water
the 
tub 
and 
immediately 
feel ScrEv_relax
the 
stress 
levels 
dropping ScrEv_relax
. 
once 
you 
have 
determined UnrelEv_bath
you 
are 
finished UnrelEv_bath
you 
can 
pull ScrEv_open_drain
the 
plug 
and 
watch UnrelEv_bath
the 
water 
and 
your 
problems 
drain+away RelNScrEv_bath
! 
<end_of_story>_bath 
before 
i 
go ScrEv_enter_bathroom
into 
the 
bathroom 
i 
always 
grab ScrEv_prepare_bath
a 
towel 
from 
the 
linen 
closet 
where 
we 
keep RelNScrEv_bath
our 
towels 
, 
soap 
and 
shampoo 
. 
i 
like 
to 
put RelNScrEv_bath
a 
radio 
on 
while 
i 
take+a+bath Evoking_bath
so 
i 
can 
relax ScrEv_relax
and 
enjoy ScrEv_relax
myself 
. 
i 
plug ScrEv_close_drain
the 
tub 
with 
a 
water 
stopper 
and 
turn+on ScrEv_turn_water_on
the 
water 
so 
it 
's UnrelEv_bath
nice 
and 
warm 
but 
not 
too 
hot 
. 
i 
put ScrEv_put_bubble_bath_scent
in 
some 
bubbles 
so 
it 
makes UnrelEv_bath
it 
nice 
and 
bubbly 
and 
smelling RelNScrEv_bath
good 
. 
when 
the 
tub 
is 
all 
filled ScrEv_fill_water/wait
i 
stop ScrEv_turn_water_off
the 
water 
and 
slowly 
get ScrEv_sink_water
inside 
. 
i 
sit+down ScrEv_relax
for 
about 
ten 
minutes 
relaxing ScrEv_relax
with 
my 
eyes 
closed UnrelEv_bath
and 
just 
thinking UnrelEv_bath
about 
the 
day 
. 
after 
about 
ten 
minutes 
i 
take ScrEv_open_drain
the 
stopper 
out 
so 
the 
tub 
can 
drain ScrEv_other_bath
and 
turn ScrEv_other_bath
the 
shower 
head 
on 
. 
i 
like UnrelEv_bath
to 
wash ScrEv_wash
myself 
off 
after 
a 
bath 
because 
there 
are UnrelEv_bath
a 
lot 
of 
bubbles 
all 
over 
me 
. 
i 
love UnrelEv_bath
taking+baths Evoking_bath
because 
they 
are 
very 
relaxing ScrEv_relax
. 
<end_of_story>_bath 
first 
, 
i 
get ScrEv_enter_bathroom
in 
the 
bathroom 
and 
make UnrelEv_bath
sure 
that 
there 
is UnrelEv_bath
a 
clean 
towel 
. 
if 
there 
is UnrelEv_bath
not 
, 
i 
go UnrelEv_bath
and 
grab ScrEv_prepare_bath
a 
clean 
one 
. 
then 
i 
pull ScrEv_prepare_bath
the 
shower 
curtain 
and 
start ScrEv_turn_water_on
the 
water 
as 
hot 
as 
it 
goes UnrelEv_bath
. 
while 
the 
water 
is 
warming ScrEv_fill_water/wait
up 
, 
and 
the 
tub 
is 
filling ScrEv_fill_water/wait
, 
i 
brush ScrEv_prepare_bath
my 
hair 
out 
. 
when 
the 
tub 
is 
filled ScrEv_fill_water/wait
, 
i 
get 
undressed ScrEv_undress
, 
pull RelNScrEv_bath
the 
curtain 
back 
and 
get ScrEv_sink_water
in 
the 
tub 
. 
if 
i 
am 
taking+a+bath Evoking_bath
for 
pleasure 
, 
i 
will 
put ScrEv_prepare_bath
on 
some 
enjoyable 
music 
and 
light ScrEv_prepare_bath
some 
candles 
. 
if 
i 
am 
sitting ScrEv_relax
in 
the 
tub 
for 
enjoyment 
i 
will 
relax ScrEv_relax
and 
maybe 
read RelNScrEv_bath
a 
book 
. 
if 
not 
, 
i 
will 
wet ScrEv_wash
my 
hair 
and 
apply ScrEv_wash
shampoo 
and 
rinse ScrEv_wash
it 
out 
. 
then 
i 
will 
apply ScrEv_wash
conditioner 
and 
let 
it 
sit ScrEv_wash
in 
my 
hair 
. 
while 
its 
sitting ScrEv_wash
, 
i 
wash ScrEv_wash
my 
body 
with 
soap 
, 
and 
then 
rinseout ScrEv_wash
the 
conditioner 
. 
before 
i 
leave ScrEv_get_out_bath
the 
tub 
, 
i 
pull ScrEv_open_drain
the 
drain 
and 
the 
shower 
curtain 
and 
run ScrEv_turn_water_on
the 
shower 
to 
rinse+off ScrEv_wash
. 
i 
then 
turn+off ScrEv_turn_water_off
the 
shower 
, 
and 
wrap ScrEv_dry
myself 
in 
a 
towel 
to 
dry+off ScrEv_dry
and 
my 
bath Evoking_bath
is 
done UnrelEv_bath
. 
<end_of_story>_bath 
while 
casually 
browsing UnrelEv_bath
through 
my 
friends 
pictures 
online 
i 
discovered UnrelEv_bath
a 
new 
revelation 
. 
they 
are 
called UnrelEv_bath
lush 
bath+bombs Evoking_bath
and 
the 
are UnrelEv_bath
colorful 
scented 
fizz 
balls 
. 
i 
quickly 
ordered RelNScrEv_bath
a 
few 
online 
from 
their 
website 
and 
when 
they 
came UnrelEv_bath
i 
was 
overcome UnrelEv_bath
with 
excitement 
. 
i 
brought ScrEv_prepare_bath
a 
pink 
potion 
one 
with 
a 
flower 
inside 
and 
a 
blue 
dream 
glitter 
one 
. 
i 
put ScrEv_close_drain
the 
hello 
kitty 
tub 
stopper 
in 
my 
bath 
tub 
and 
ran ScrEv_fill_water/wait
my 
bathwater 
until 
the 
tub 
was ScrEv_fill_water/wait
halfway 
full 
. 
then 
i 
dropped ScrEv_prepare_bath
the 
bath 
bomb 
in 
the 
water 
and 
was 
anointed UnrelEv_bath
by 
the 
wonderful 
smell 
of 
lavender 
. 
the 
water 
in 
the 
tub 
fizzled RelNScrEv_bath
with 
pretty 
blue 
glitter 
. 
i 
got+in ScrEv_sink_water
an 
soaked ScrEv_relax
for 
more 
than 
an 
hour 
and 
got+out ScrEv_get_out_bath
feeling RelNScrEv_bath
like 
a 
million 
bucks 
. 
i 
seemed UnrelEv_bath
to 
be 
a 
thousand 
times 
cleaner 
than 
i 
was UnrelEv_bath
before 
i 
got UnrelEv_bath
it 
. 
i 
even 
smelled RelNScrEv_bath
great 
the 
whole 
entire 
day 
. 
<end_of_story>_bath 
after 
a 
long 
day 
of 
gardening UnrelEv_bath
, 
i 
came ScrEv_enter_bathroom
inside 
to 
wash ScrEv_wash
my 
hands 
. 
while 
washing ScrEv_wash
them 
, 
i 
glanced RelNScrEv_bath
at 
myself 
in 
the 
mirror 
and 
realized UnrelEv_bath
that 
i 
was UnrelEv_bath
much 
dirtier 
than 
i 
thought 
. 
i 
figured UnrelEv_bath
i 
should 
take+a+bath Evoking_bath
before 
doing UnrelEv_bath
anything 
else 
so 
as 
to 
not 
soil RelNScrEv_bath
anything 
in 
my 
home 
. 
i 
turned+off ScrEv_turn_water_off
the 
sink 
, 
dried ScrEv_dry
my 
hands 
, 
and 
set+off ScrEv_prepare_bath
in 
search 
of 
a 
bath 
towel 
and 
a 
change 
of 
clothes 
. 
i 
decided UnrelEv_bath
on 
a 
bath Evoking_bath
as 
i 
had UnrelEv_bath
a 
long 
day 
and 
it 
sounded UnrelEv_bath
so 
much 
more 
relaxing ScrEv_relax
. 
once 
i 
had ScrEv_prepare_bath
the 
items 
i 
needed UnrelEv_bath
, 
i 
went+back ScrEv_enter_bathroom
to 
the 
bathroom 
and 
turned ScrEv_turn_water_on
the 
tub 
on 
. 
i 
turned ScrEv_turn_water_on
the 
hot 
and 
cold 
nozzles 
both 
, 
and 
adjusted RelNScrEv_bath
them 
as 
needed UnrelEv_bath
after 
testing ScrEv_check_temp
the 
temperature 
with 
my 
hand 
. 
once 
the 
tub 
was ScrEv_fill_water/wait
half 
full 
i 
turned ScrEv_turn_water_off
it 
off 
, 
as 
i 
knew UnrelEv_bath
my 
body 
weight 
would 
displace RelNScrEv_bath
the 
water 
and 
cause UnrelEv_bath
the 
level 
to 
rise RelNScrEv_bath
once 
i 
got ScrEv_sink_water
in 
. 
i 
sat+down ScrEv_sink_water
in 
the 
perfectly 
warm 
water 
and 
relaxed ScrEv_relax
. 
once 
the 
water 
started 
cooling+down RelNScrEv_bath
, 
i 
decided UnrelEv_bath
to 
go+ahead UnrelEv_bath
and 
wash ScrEv_wash
myself 
. 
i 
poured ScrEv_apply_soap
some 
bodywash 
on 
a 
cloth 
and 
washed ScrEv_wash
from 
the 
top 
down 
. 
then 
, 
i 
rinsed ScrEv_wash
and 
drained ScrEv_open_drain
the 
tub 
and 
dried+off ScrEv_dry
. 
that 
's 
how 
i 
took+a+bath Evoking_bath
. 
<end_of_story>_bath 
in 
the 
evening 
i 
take+baths Evoking_bath
. 
today 
is UnrelEv_bath
no 
different 
. 
after 
a 
long 
day 
, 
it 
's 
such 
a 
relaxing ScrEv_relax
thing 
to 
do UnrelEv_bath
. 
i 
turned ScrEv_turn_water_on
the 
hot 
and 
cold 
handles 
to 
the 
exact 
right 
place 
out 
of 
habit 
and 
filled ScrEv_fill_water/wait
tub 
with 
hot 
water 
. 
i 
slid ScrEv_sink_water
down 
into 
the 
tub 
and 
was UnrelEv_bath
instantly 
comfortable 
. 
my 
aching UnrelEv_bath
muscles 
were 
finally 
getting 
to 
relax ScrEv_relax
. 
as 
i 
let 
the 
water 
warm RelNScrEv_bath
me 
up 
, 
i 
washed ScrEv_wash
myself 
with 
a 
soapy 
washcloth 
careful 
to 
get ScrEv_wash
all 
the 
dirt 
and 
grime 
off 
. 
after 
cleaning+up ScrEv_wash
a 
bit 
, 
i 
grabbed RelNScrEv_bath
my 
book 
and 
began 
to 
read RelNScrEv_bath
. 
after 
about 
523 
minutes 
i 
let 
the 
water 
drain ScrEv_open_drain
. 
i 
got+out ScrEv_get_out_bath
and 
dried+off ScrEv_dry
with 
my 
huge 
, 
soft 
towel 
. 
i 
put+on ScrEv_get_dressed
my 
robe 
and 
threw RelNScrEv_bath
the 
towel 
over 
the 
edge 
off 
the 
bathtub 
. 
i 
felt RelNScrEv_bath
completely 
refreshed RelNScrEv_bath
and 
ready 
to 
continue+reading UnrelEv_bath
in 
my 
bedroom 
, 
and 
my 
muscles 
were UnrelEv_bath
n't 
quite 
as 
sore 
as 
before 
. 
<end_of_story>_bath 
there 
's UnrelEv_bath
nothing 
i 
love UnrelEv_bath
more 
after 
a 
long 
day 
at 
work 
then 
to 
come+home+to+a+warm+bath Evoking_bath
. 
most 
people 
think UnrelEv_bath
that 
taking+a+bath Evoking_bath
is 
a 
simple 
process 
. 
oh 
how 
they 
are UnrelEv_bath
wrong 
. 
taking+a+bath Evoking_bath
is UnrelEv_bath
actually 
a 
long 
process 
involving 
many 
steps 
. 
first 
i 
must 
start 
drawing ScrEv_turn_water_on
the 
water 
which 
is UnrelEv_bath
a 
challenge 
in 
itself 
as 
i 
want UnrelEv_bath
to 
make+sure ScrEv_check_temp
it 
warm 
, 
but 
not 
too 
warm 
. 
next 
as 
the 
water 
is 
still 
running ScrEv_fill_water/wait
i 
add ScrEv_put_bubble_bath_scent
a 
little 
bit 
of 
bubble 
soap 
for 
the 
added UnrelEv_bath
benefits 
. 
but 
i 
do 
n't 
just 
want UnrelEv_bath
bubbles 
i 
want UnrelEv_bath
a 
relaxing ScrEv_relax
aromatherapy 
. 
with 
this 
in 
mind 
i 
add ScrEv_put_bubble_bath_scent
a 
little 
bit 
of 
essential 
oils 
and 
minerals 
. 
finally 
i 
am UnrelEv_bath
ready 
to 
get ScrEv_sink_water
into 
the 
water 
. 
but 
this 
is UnrelEv_bath
nowhere 
near 
the 
end 
of 
the 
process 
. 
now 
i 
relax ScrEv_relax
in 
the 
water 
while 
reading RelNScrEv_bath
my 
novel 
and 
letting 
the 
oils 
soak RelNScrEv_bath
into 
my 
skin 
. 
ah 
this 
is 
how 
we 
are 
meant UnrelEv_bath
to 
relax ScrEv_relax
. 
<end_of_story>_bath 
i 
had 
spent UnrelEv_bath
the 
day 
planting UnrelEv_bath
a 
tree 
and 
needed UnrelEv_bath
to 
take+a+bath Evoking_bath
to 
clean ScrEv_wash
myself 
and 
relax ScrEv_relax
those 
tired UnrelEv_bath
muscles 
. 
i 
went ScrEv_enter_bathroom
to 
the 
bathroom 
and 
turned+on ScrEv_turn_water_on
the 
faucet 
in 
the 
bathtub 
. 
once 
the 
water 
reached RelNScrEv_bath
the 
temperature 
that 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_bath
i 
plugged ScrEv_close_drain
the 
drain 
to 
fill ScrEv_fill_water/wait
the 
bathtub 
. 
while 
the 
tub 
was 
filling+up ScrEv_fill_water/wait
i 
undressed ScrEv_undress
myself 
and 
put RelNScrEv_bath
the 
dirty 
soiled UnrelEv_bath
clothing 
in 
the 
the 
hamper 
. 
i 
turned ScrEv_turn_water_off
the 
water 
off 
and 
got+into ScrEv_sink_water
the 
nice 
hot 
relaxing ScrEv_relax
tub 
of 
water 
. 
i 
added ScrEv_put_bubble_bath_scent
some 
bath 
soap 
into 
the 
tub 
and 
proceeded UnrelEv_bath
to 
scrub ScrEv_wash
the 
dirt 
off 
my 
body 
with 
a 
washcloth 
. 
after 
washing ScrEv_wash
myself 
and 
relaxing ScrEv_relax
a 
bit 
i 
unclog ScrEv_open_drain
the 
drain 
and 
watch UnrelEv_bath
the 
dirty 
soapy 
water 
spiral+down ScrEv_open_drain
the 
drain 
. 
i 
rinse ScrEv_wash
body 
quickly 
in 
the 
shower 
to 
rinse ScrEv_wash
the 
soap 
off 
. 
i 
get+out ScrEv_get_out_bath
and 
grab ScrEv_get_towel
a 
towel 
to 
dry ScrEv_dry
myself 
. 
i 
put+on ScrEv_get_dressed
a 
clean 
set 
of 
clothes 
and 
feel RelNScrEv_bath
fresh 
. 
<end_of_story>_bath 
last 
night 
, 
i 
decided UnrelEv_bath
to 
take+a+bath Evoking_bath
. 
i 
usually 
take RelNScrEv_bath
a 
shower 
instead 
, 
but 
my 
muscles 
felt UnrelEv_bath
sore 
and 
i 
thought UnrelEv_bath
i 
could 
use+a+bath Evoking_bath
with 
some 
epsom 
salt 
. 
the 
epsom 
salt 
bath Evoking_bath
is UnrelEv_bath
really 
good 
at 
soothing 
sore 
muscles 
, 
plus 
it 
is 
very 
relaxing ScrEv_relax
. 
i 
ran ScrEv_fill_water/wait
a 
very 
hot 
bath 
and 
poured ScrEv_put_bubble_bath_scent
some 
epsom 
salt 
in 
so 
it 
could 
dissolve RelNScrEv_bath
. 
while 
the 
bath 
was 
running ScrEv_fill_water/wait
, 
i 
grabbed ScrEv_prepare_bath
a 
towel 
and 
a 
book 
i 
was 
reading UnrelEv_bath
. 
i 
set ScrEv_prepare_bath
it 
all 
up 
next 
to 
the 
tub 
and 
undressed ScrEv_undress
. 
i 
slid+into ScrEv_sink_water
the 
hot 
water 
and 
felt RelNScrEv_bath
the 
salt 
granules 
prickling RelNScrEv_bath
my 
skin 
, 
as 
my 
muscles 
finally 
relaxed ScrEv_relax
. 
after 
some 
time 
, 
the 
water 
cooled RelNScrEv_bath
, 
so 
i 
added ScrEv_turn_water_on
some 
more 
hot 
water 
. 
i 
stayed ScrEv_other_bath
in 
the 
bathtub 
for 
about 
523 
minutes 
, 
until 
my 
muscles 
felt RelNScrEv_bath
better 
. 
when 
i 
was 
finally 
done UnrelEv_bath
, 
i 
drained ScrEv_open_drain
the 
cooled RelNScrEv_bath
water 
, 
toweled+off ScrEv_dry
, 
and 
got+dressed ScrEv_get_dressed
.

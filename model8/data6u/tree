my 
family 
recently 
moved UnrelEv_tree
to 
a 
new 
home 
with 
a 
bland 
and 
boring 
yard 
. 
we 
decided UnrelEv_tree
to 
plant+some+trees Evoking_tree
to 
spice+up UnrelEv_tree
the 
place 
, 
so 
my 
mother 
, 
father 
, 
siblings 
and 
i 
all 
packed UnrelEv_tree
ourselves 
into 
the 
suv 
and 
drove UnrelEv_tree
to 
a 
nearby 
nursery 
. 
we 
looked ScrEv_choose_tree
at 
many 
different 
types 
of 
trees 
before 
settling ScrEv_choose_tree
on 
the 
apple 
trees 
. 
we 
bought ScrEv_get_tree
several 
baby 
apple 
trees 
and 
took ScrEv_take_home
them 
home 
for 
planting Evoking_tree
. 
first 
, 
my 
father 
and 
older 
brother 
dug ScrEv_dig_hole
large 
holes 
in 
the 
ground 
. 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_tree
to 
help UnrelEv_tree
, 
but 
they 
said UnrelEv_tree
i 
was UnrelEv_tree
too 
young 
to 
hold UnrelEv_tree
the 
shovel 
! 
after 
the 
holes 
were 
dug ScrEv_dig_hole
, 
the 
apple 
trees 
were 
placed ScrEv_place_root
inside 
. 
then 
, 
we 
shoveled ScrEv_refill_hole
dirt 
into 
the 
holes 
to 
fix UnrelEv_tree
the 
apple 
trees 
in 
place 
. 
i 
was 
allowed UnrelEv_tree
to 
help UnrelEv_tree
with 
that 
, 
thankfully 
. 
after 
all 
that 
, 
our 
baby 
apple 
trees 
were 
planted Evoking_tree
in 
the 
ground 
and 
we 
were UnrelEv_tree
all 
very 
excited 
to 
see UnrelEv_tree
what 
they 
would 
look UnrelEv_tree
like 
as 
they 
grew+up RelNScrEv_tree
. 
<end_of_story>_tree 
when 
i 
was UnrelEv_tree
a 
freshman 
in 
high 
school 
we 
each 
had UnrelEv_tree
the 
opportunity 
to 
buy ScrEv_get_tree
an 
inexpensive 
tree 
as 
part 
of 
the 
arbor 
day 
holiday 
. 
part 
of 
the 
proceeds 
for 
the 
purchase 
were 
going UnrelEv_tree
to 
plant+more+trees Evoking_tree
in 
town 
. 
the 
tree 
i 
had+was UnrelEv_tree
some 
kind 
of 
evergreen 
tree 
and 
i 
planned UnrelEv_tree
to 
plant+it Evoking_tree
in 
the 
front 
yard 
. 
i 
asked UnrelEv_tree
my 
dad 
where 
it 
'd 
be 
best 
to 
plant+it Evoking_tree
and 
we 
picked ScrEv_find_place
a 
spot 
where 
there 
were UnrelEv_tree
some 
flowers 
, 
but 
no 
trees 
. 
in 
order 
to 
plant+it Evoking_tree
i 
read RelNScrEv_tree
the 
instructions 
that 
came UnrelEv_tree
with 
the 
tree 
and 
started UnrelEv_tree
by 
digging ScrEv_dig_hole
a 
hole 
that 
was UnrelEv_tree
about 
twice 
the 
size 
of 
the 
root 
ball 
of 
the 
tree 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_tree
a 
small 
tree 
so 
this 
was UnrelEv_tree
not 
a 
big 
hole 
. 
i 
then 
tried UnrelEv_tree
to 
make ScrEv_dig_hole
the 
hole 
a 
good 
shape 
before 
putting+in ScrEv_refill_hole
some 
moss 
and 
fill 
dirt 
. 
i 
watered ScrEv_water
the 
tree 
that 
day 
and 
made+sure UnrelEv_tree
to 
water ScrEv_water
it 
each 
day 
for 
about 
a 
week 
until 
we 
had UnrelEv_tree
a 
good 
rain 
. 
the 
tree 
grew RelNScrEv_tree
and 
became UnrelEv_tree
quite 
large 
. 
the 
one 
thing 
i 
did 
n't 
realize UnrelEv_tree
is 
that 
i 
should 
have 
planned UnrelEv_tree
better 
for 
how 
big 
the 
tree 
was 
going 
to 
get UnrelEv_tree
because 
it 
ended+up+shadowing UnrelEv_tree
over 
the 
flower 
planters 
a 
bit 
. 
<end_of_story>_tree 
the 
first 
step 
to 
planting+a+tree Evoking_tree
is 
to 
find ScrEv_find_place
a 
suitable 
spot 
for 
the 
tree 
. 
one 
thing 
many 
people 
do 
not 
think UnrelEv_tree
about 
is UnrelEv_tree
the 
amount 
of 
airspace 
needed UnrelEv_tree
once 
the 
tree 
actually 
starts UnrelEv_tree
growing RelNScrEv_tree
. 
make+sure UnrelEv_tree
there 
are UnrelEv_tree
know 
power-lines 
or 
other 
objects 
that 
may 
be 
affected UnrelEv_tree
the 
growing RelNScrEv_tree
tree 
. 
after 
a 
suitable 
spot 
is 
found ScrEv_find_place
, 
get ScrEv_get_tools
a 
shovel 
and 
dig ScrEv_dig_hole
a 
whole 
large 
enough 
to 
cover UnrelEv_tree
the 
entire 
base 
off 
the 
tree 
with 
at 
least 
six 
inches 
of 
soil 
to 
spare UnrelEv_tree
on 
top 
of 
the 
trees 
root 
bulb 
. 
when 
the 
hole 
is 
dug ScrEv_dig_hole
, 
shake RelNScrEv_tree
some 
of 
the 
loose 
dirt 
from 
the 
tree 
's 
root 
bulb 
and 
then 
place ScrEv_place_root
the 
tree 
into 
the 
newly 
created ScrEv_dig_hole
hole 
. 
pack ScrEv_refill_hole
the 
area 
around 
the 
hole 
and 
tree 
bulb 
with 
some 
of 
the 
dirt 
that 
was 
excavated ScrEv_dig_hole
from 
the 
hole 
. 
water ScrEv_water
the 
hole 
, 
the 
use UnrelEv_tree
the 
shovel 
to 
pat ScrEv_tamp_dirt
the 
area 
around 
the 
tree 
down 
. 
water ScrEv_water
the 
area 
one 
more 
time 
. 
<end_of_story>_tree 
i 
am UnrelEv_tree
an 
avid 
gardener 
. 
i 
have UnrelEv_tree
a 
large 
garden 
and 
lots 
of 
flower 
beds 
. 
but 
this 
year 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_tree
to 
plant+some+small+fruit+trees Evoking_tree
in 
my 
garden 
. 
i 
went UnrelEv_tree
to 
the 
nursery 
and 
picked+out ScrEv_choose_tree
a 
small 
dwarf 
apple 
tree 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_tree
to 
plant Evoking_tree
. 
the 
tree 
was UnrelEv_tree
young 
and 
was UnrelEv_tree
basically 
a 
very 
small 
trunk 
with 
two 
branches 
. 
i 
brought ScrEv_take_home
it 
home 
and 
read RelNScrEv_tree
the 
instructions 
for 
planting+it Evoking_tree
. 
the 
whole 
i 
needed 
to 
dig ScrEv_dig_hole
was UnrelEv_tree
523 
inches 
across 
and 
523 
foot 
deep 
. 
i 
used UnrelEv_tree
my 
garden 
shovel 
to 
break+up RelNScrEv_tree
the 
grass 
and 
dig ScrEv_dig_hole
the 
hole 
. 
i 
saved RelNScrEv_tree
the 
dirt 
in 
my 
wheelbarrow 
to 
put ScrEv_refill_hole
back 
in 
the 
whole 
when 
i 
was UnrelEv_tree
done 
. 
i 
put ScrEv_place_root
the 
small 
tree 
in 
the 
whole 
and 
filled ScrEv_water
the 
hole 
with 
water 
. 
when 
the 
water 
had 
saturated ScrEv_water
the 
earth 
i 
then 
shoveled ScrEv_refill_hole
thew 
leftover 
dirt 
back 
in 
the 
hole 
. 
i 
was 
finished UnrelEv_tree
in 
about 
523 
mintes 
. 
i 
think UnrelEv_tree
i 
will 
get ScrEv_get_tree
several 
more 
fruit 
trees 
to 
plant Evoking_tree
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_tree
very 
easy 
to 
do UnrelEv_tree
. 
<end_of_story>_tree 
i 
planted+a+tree Evoking_tree
for 
arbor 
day 
last 
year 
. 
the 
first 
thing 
i 
did UnrelEv_tree
was 
decide UnrelEv_tree
where 
i 
want 
to 
plant+my+tree Evoking_tree
and 
i 
chose ScrEv_find_place
a 
nice 
spot 
in 
my 
backyard 
. 
then 
i 
decided ScrEv_choose_tree
what 
kind 
of 
tree 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_tree
. 
i 
thought UnrelEv_tree
a 
shady 
tree 
would 
be UnrelEv_tree
nice 
in 
that 
spot 
, 
so 
i 
went RelNScrEv_tree
to 
a 
tree 
place 
called UnrelEv_tree
a 
nursery 
and 
picked+out ScrEv_get_tree
a 
nice 
young 
tree 
called UnrelEv_tree
a 
sapling 
and 
i 
loaded RelNScrEv_tree
into 
the 
back 
of 
my 
truck 
to 
take ScrEv_take_home
home 
. 
once 
i 
was UnrelEv_tree
at 
home 
again 
, 
i 
got ScrEv_get_tools
my 
shovel 
and 
dug ScrEv_dig_hole
a 
hole 
in 
the 
right 
spot 
in 
the 
backyard 
. 
then 
i 
unwrapped ScrEv_unwrap_root
the 
trees 
roots 
and 
very 
, 
very 
carefully 
place ScrEv_place_root
the 
tree 
into 
the 
hole 
. 
the 
roots 
at 
the 
bottom 
are 
called UnrelEv_tree
a 
root 
ball 
and 
is 
made UnrelEv_tree
of 
the 
roots 
and 
dirt 
that 
protects UnrelEv_tree
the 
roots 
. 
i 
was UnrelEv_tree
very 
careful 
not 
to 
knock UnrelEv_tree
the 
dirt 
off 
so 
the 
roots 
would 
n't 
be 
damaged UnrelEv_tree
. 
once 
the 
root 
ball 
was 
settled ScrEv_place_root
into 
the 
hole 
and 
the 
tree 
was 
standing+up RelNScrEv_tree
straight 
, 
i 
filled ScrEv_refill_hole
the 
hole 
up 
with 
dirt 
again 
and 
then 
watered ScrEv_water
the 
tree 
. 
my 
tree 
is UnrelEv_tree
healthy 
and 
growing RelNScrEv_tree
because 
i 
was UnrelEv_tree
careful 
with 
it 
. 
<end_of_story>_tree 
today 
is UnrelEv_tree
arbor 
day 
and 
i 
am 
going 
to 
plant+a+tree Evoking_tree
to 
celebrate UnrelEv_tree
. 
my 
mother 
bought ScrEv_get_tree
an 
apple 
tree 
at 
the 
plant 
store 
for 
me 
. 
she 
helped UnrelEv_tree
me 
carry RelNScrEv_tree
it 
outside 
to 
plant Evoking_tree
. 
i 
had 
to 
pick ScrEv_find_place
the 
perfect 
spot 
for 
my 
tree 
. 
i 
decided UnrelEv_tree
it 
would 
look UnrelEv_tree
really 
nice 
over 
by 
the 
swing 
set 
. 
i 
picked ScrEv_find_place
a 
spot 
far 
enough 
away 
that 
the 
apples 
would 
n't 
fall UnrelEv_tree
on 
my 
swing 
set 
, 
though 
. 
i 
got ScrEv_get_tools
a 
shovel 
and 
dug ScrEv_dig_hole
a 
really 
deep 
hole 
. 
it 
took UnrelEv_tree
me 
a 
long 
time 
! 
then 
my 
mom 
helped UnrelEv_tree
me 
put ScrEv_place_fertilizers
a 
little 
bit 
of 
fertilizer 
in 
the 
hole 
. 
fertilizer 
helps UnrelEv_tree
the 
tree 
grow RelNScrEv_tree
. 
the 
next 
thing 
i 
did UnrelEv_tree
was 
put ScrEv_place_root
the 
bottom 
of 
the 
tree 
into 
the 
hole 
and 
cover ScrEv_refill_hole
the 
root 
ball 
up 
with 
dirt 
. 
finally 
, 
i 
took RelNScrEv_tree
the 
water 
hose 
and 
sprayed ScrEv_water
the 
dirt 
around 
the 
bottom 
of 
the 
tree 
with 
water 
. 
i 
ca 
n't 
wait UnrelEv_tree
to 
see UnrelEv_tree
my 
new 
tree 
grow RelNScrEv_tree
bigger 
and 
bigger 
! 
<end_of_story>_tree 
recently 
, 
my 
kids 
reminded UnrelEv_tree
me 
that 
arbor 
day 
was 
approaching UnrelEv_tree
. 
i 
always 
wanted 
to 
do UnrelEv_tree
something 
in 
honor 
of 
my 
mom 
, 
and 
why 
not 
plant+a+tree Evoking_tree
that 
i 
could 
watch UnrelEv_tree
grow RelNScrEv_tree
in 
our 
backyard 
. 
the 
tree 
would 
help UnrelEv_tree
with 
the 
arbor 
day 
festivities 
, 
as 
well 
as 
be UnrelEv_tree
a 
memory 
tree 
that 
is UnrelEv_tree
in 
dedication 
of 
my 
mom 
. 
we 
went RelNScrEv_tree
to 
our 
local 
home 
improvement 
store 
in 
search 
of 
the 
perfect 
tree 
for 
our 
task 
. 
the 
kids 
decided ScrEv_choose_tree
that 
we 
should 
have UnrelEv_tree
some 
sort 
of 
fruit 
tree 
, 
and 
what 
better 
tree 
than 
an 
orange 
tree 
, 
because 
after 
all 
we 
do 
live UnrelEv_tree
in 
florida 
. 
once 
we 
got ScrEv_get_tree
the 
tree 
, 
a 
worker 
assisted UnrelEv_tree
us 
in 
loading RelNScrEv_tree
the 
tree 
onto 
my 
truck 
, 
and 
home 
bound 
we 
were UnrelEv_tree
. 
once 
we 
got ScrEv_take_home
home 
, 
we 
decided ScrEv_find_place
on 
a 
spot 
for 
the 
tree 
, 
and 
began 
to 
dig ScrEv_dig_hole
a 
hole 
to 
place ScrEv_place_root
the 
tree 
into 
. 
we 
placed ScrEv_place_root
the 
tree 
in 
the 
hole 
, 
and 
then 
covered ScrEv_refill_hole
back 
up 
the 
hole 
. 
we 
then 
watered ScrEv_water
the 
tree 
, 
and 
the 
process 
of 
watching UnrelEv_tree
the 
tree 
grow RelNScrEv_tree
began UnrelEv_tree
. 
<end_of_story>_tree 
every 
year 
we 
celebrate UnrelEv_tree
arbor 
day 
. 
last 
year 
we 
we 
decided UnrelEv_tree
to 
celebrate UnrelEv_tree
the 
holiday 
by 
planing+a+tree Evoking_tree
. 
we 
went RelNScrEv_tree
to 
the 
local 
plant 
nursery 
. 
we 
talked RelNScrEv_tree
to 
the 
employees 
to 
find+out RelNScrEv_tree
which 
trees 
grow RelNScrEv_tree
well 
in 
our 
area 
and 
in 
the 
type 
of 
soil 
we 
have UnrelEv_tree
. 
we 
chose ScrEv_choose_tree
a 
small 
maple 
seedling 
. 
when 
we 
got ScrEv_take_home
home 
, 
we 
chose ScrEv_find_place
an 
area 
of 
our 
yard 
with 
lots 
of 
sun 
. 
we 
dug ScrEv_dig_hole
a 
hole 
just 
a 
little 
bigger 
than 
the 
roots 
of 
our 
seedling 
. 
we 
put ScrEv_place_root
the 
seedling 
in 
the 
hole 
in 
the 
ground 
very 
carefully 
, 
then 
covered ScrEv_refill_hole
the 
roots 
with 
dirt 
. 
we 
patted ScrEv_tamp_dirt
the 
dirt 
down 
really 
good 
to 
make+sure UnrelEv_tree
the 
little 
tree 
seedling 
would 
be UnrelEv_tree
stable 
in 
the 
ground 
when 
it 
was UnrelEv_tree
windy 
. 
then 
we 
watered ScrEv_water
the 
tree 
. 
we 
've 
been 
watching UnrelEv_tree
and 
watering ScrEv_water
our 
tree 
for 
a 
year 
and 
slowly 
but 
surely 
our 
little 
tree 
is 
growing RelNScrEv_tree
. 
<end_of_story>_tree 
my 
friend 
, 
tom 
, 
had 
moved UnrelEv_tree
into 
a 
new 
house 
, 
and 
decided UnrelEv_tree
to 
plant+a+small+tree Evoking_tree
to 
help+make UnrelEv_tree
his 
yard 
look UnrelEv_tree
better 
. 
he 
had 
been 
advised RelNScrEv_tree
by 
a 
tree 
expert 
, 
that 
the 
best 
time 
to 
plant+it Evoking_tree
was UnrelEv_tree
in 
april 
or 
may 
. 
so 
about 
several 
weeks 
after 
tom 
had 
moved UnrelEv_tree
into 
his 
new 
home 
, 
he 
went+ahead UnrelEv_tree
to 
plant+the+tree Evoking_tree
in 
mid 
april 
. 
he 
first 
got UnrelEv_tree
and 
checked UnrelEv_tree
some 
maps 
to 
make+sure UnrelEv_tree
he 
did 
n't 
mistakenly 
end+up UnrelEv_tree
digging ScrEv_dig_hole
into 
any 
telephone 
or 
gas 
lines 
. 
once 
he 
found ScrEv_find_place
a 
suitable 
spot 
to 
plant+his+new+tree Evoking_tree
, 
tom 
took ScrEv_get_tools
a 
shovel 
and 
began UnrelEv_tree
preparing ScrEv_dig_hole
the 
hole 
to 
place ScrEv_place_root
it 
in 
. 
next 
, 
he 
prepared RelNScrEv_tree
the 
tree 
for 
planting Evoking_tree
by 
turning RelNScrEv_tree
carefully 
upside 
down 
to 
remove RelNScrEv_tree
it 
from 
the 
pot 
it 
came UnrelEv_tree
in 
. 
he 
then 
gently 
, 
placed ScrEv_place_root
the 
tree 
into 
the 
hole 
. 
tom 
also 
filled ScrEv_refill_hole
the 
hole 
with 
some 
compost 
and 
manure 
to 
help UnrelEv_tree
the 
tree 
grow RelNScrEv_tree
better 
. 
once 
this 
was UnrelEv_tree
done 
, 
he 
filled ScrEv_refill_hole
up 
the 
hole 
completely 
and 
watered ScrEv_water
the 
tree 
. 
finally 
, 
he 
placed RelNScrEv_tree
mulch 
on 
top 
and 
then 
stopped UnrelEv_tree
to 
admire UnrelEv_tree
the 
beautiful 
new 
tree 
in 
his 
yard 
. 
<end_of_story>_tree 
my 
classmates 
and 
i 
needed 
to 
plant+a+nice+tree Evoking_tree
in 
front 
of 
the 
new 
school 
building 
that 
was 
just 
built UnrelEv_tree
this 
year 
. 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_tree
to 
find ScrEv_choose_tree
a 
tree 
that 
would 
last UnrelEv_tree
a 
quite 
long 
time 
. 
we 
found ScrEv_choose_tree
a 
nice 
pine 
tree 
that 
was UnrelEv_tree
just 
large 
enough 
to 
be UnrelEv_tree
a 
foot 
. 
we 
dug ScrEv_dig_hole
a 
nice 
hole 
in 
the 
ground 
, 
and 
insured UnrelEv_tree
the 
soil 
was UnrelEv_tree
the 
proper 
type 
to 
accept UnrelEv_tree
a 
tree 
of 
this 
size 
. 
it 
had 
to 
be UnrelEv_tree
nice 
and 
soft 
, 
and 
in 
a 
safe 
location 
where 
kids 
wo 
n't 
trample UnrelEv_tree
over 
it 
. 
i 
dug ScrEv_dig_hole
the 
hole 
about 
523 
'' 
'' 
deep 
and 
insured UnrelEv_tree
it 
was UnrelEv_tree
wide 
enough 
for 
the 
tree 
. 
we 
planted ScrEv_place_root
the 
tree 
and 
began UnrelEv_tree
to 
fill ScrEv_refill_hole
in 
the 
surrounding 
area 
of 
it 
with 
soil 
to 
make+sure UnrelEv_tree
it 
would 
hold UnrelEv_tree
in 
place 
as 
perfect 
as 
possible 
. 
the 
tree 
looked UnrelEv_tree
perfect 
and 
was UnrelEv_tree
ready 
to 
withstand UnrelEv_tree
the 
first 
school 
year 
outside 
the 
new 
building 
. 
<end_of_story>_tree 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_tree
to 
plant+an+apple+tree Evoking_tree
in 
my 
yard 
. 
i 
thought UnrelEv_tree
that 
my 
children 
would 
enjoy UnrelEv_tree
the 
apples 
for 
many 
years 
to 
come UnrelEv_tree
. 
after 
picking ScrEv_choose_tree
the 
perfect 
tree 
and 
bringing ScrEv_take_home
it 
home 
, 
i 
backed UnrelEv_tree
my 
car 
into 
the 
area 
that 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_tree
to 
plant+the+tree Evoking_tree
in 
. 
i 
unloaded RelNScrEv_tree
the 
tree 
and 
waled UnrelEv_tree
to 
my 
garage 
and 
got ScrEv_get_tools
a 
shovel 
and 
pulled ScrEv_get_tools
the 
garden 
hose 
over 
to 
the 
tree 
. 
i 
dug ScrEv_dig_hole
a 
very 
large 
hole 
and 
filled ScrEv_water
it 
with 
water 
. 
i 
unwrapped ScrEv_unwrap_root
the 
burlap 
from 
around 
the 
root 
ball 
of 
the 
tree 
and 
placed ScrEv_place_root
the 
tree 
into 
the 
hole 
. 
i 
filled ScrEv_refill_hole
the 
hole 
back 
in 
with 
dirt 
and 
patted ScrEv_tamp_dirt
the 
soil 
down 
firmly 
. 
i 
watered ScrEv_water
the 
soil 
around 
the 
base 
of 
the 
tree 
. 
i 
will 
now 
wait UnrelEv_tree
to 
enjoy UnrelEv_tree
fresh 
crisp 
apples 
from 
my 
apple 
tree 
, 
hoping UnrelEv_tree
that 
my 
hard 
work 
is UnrelEv_tree
worth 
it 
. 
<end_of_story>_tree 
on 
the 
weekend 
i 
planted+an+apple+an+apple+tree Evoking_tree
. 
first 
, 
i 
put+on ScrEv_get_tools
gardening 
gloves 
to 
protect UnrelEv_tree
my 
hands 
. 
next 
, 
i 
used UnrelEv_tree
a 
small 
shovel 
to 
dig ScrEv_dig_hole
a 
hole 
in 
a 
patch 
of 
dirt 
in 
my 
backyard 
. 
i 
then 
took RelNScrEv_tree
an 
apple 
seed 
and 
placed ScrEv_place_root
it 
inside 
the 
hole 
. 
next 
, 
i 
took RelNScrEv_tree
the 
soil 
that 
i 
had 
dug+out ScrEv_dig_hole
earlier 
and 
placed ScrEv_refill_hole
it 
on 
top 
of 
the 
seed 
, 
creating UnrelEv_tree
a 
thin 
layer 
of 
soil 
on 
top 
of 
the 
seed 
. 
i 
then 
took ScrEv_get_tools
my 
watering 
can 
over 
to 
the 
water 
hose 
and 
used UnrelEv_tree
the 
hose 
to 
fill RelNScrEv_tree
the 
can 
up 
with 
water 
. 
when 
the 
can 
was UnrelEv_tree
full 
, 
i 
brought ScrEv_get_tools
it 
back 
over 
to 
the 
patch 
of 
dirt 
where 
the 
apple 
seed 
was 
planted Evoking_tree
, 
and 
i 
gently 
poured ScrEv_water
the 
water 
from 
the 
watering 
can 
onto 
the 
patch 
of 
dirt 
, 
watering ScrEv_water
my 
newly-planted Unclear_tree
apple 
seed 
. 
i 
thought UnrelEv_tree
happily 
about 
how 
exciting 
it 
will 
be UnrelEv_tree
when 
my 
tiny 
apple 
seed 
grows RelNScrEv_tree
into 
a 
huge 
apple 
tree 
. 
<end_of_story>_tree 
if 
you 
want UnrelEv_tree
to 
plant+a+tree Evoking_tree
it 
is UnrelEv_tree
best 
to 
get ScrEv_get_tree
a 
small 
sapling 
. 
dig ScrEv_dig_hole
yourself 
a 
hole 
and 
put ScrEv_place_root
the 
saplings 
root 
ball 
in 
the 
hole 
. 
you 
do 
not 
want UnrelEv_tree
to 
cut UnrelEv_tree
or 
break UnrelEv_tree
the 
roots 
when 
you 
put ScrEv_place_root
it 
in 
the 
ground 
. 
make+sure UnrelEv_tree
your 
hole 
is UnrelEv_tree
big 
enough 
but 
not 
too 
deep 
. 
you 
also 
do 
not 
want UnrelEv_tree
your 
hole 
to 
be UnrelEv_tree
too 
narrow 
. 
you 
can 
remove RelNScrEv_tree
any 
dead 
or 
dried 
up 
roots 
from 
the 
ball 
. 
you 
now 
want UnrelEv_tree
to 
refill ScrEv_refill_hole
with 
dirt 
lightly 
tamping ScrEv_tamp_dirt
the 
dirt 
as 
you 
go UnrelEv_tree
. 
make RelNScrEv_tree
a 
mound 
of 
dirt 
around 
the 
base 
of 
the 
tree 
with 
the 
dirt 
that 
no 
longer 
fits UnrelEv_tree
in 
the 
hole 
. 
water ScrEv_water
the 
tree 
. 
it 
is UnrelEv_tree
a 
good 
idea 
to 
also 
add RelNScrEv_tree
some 
sort 
of 
mulch 
to 
protect UnrelEv_tree
the 
dirt 
from 
washing+away UnrelEv_tree
. 
this 
will 
also 
help+keep UnrelEv_tree
weeds 
from 
growing UnrelEv_tree
and 
help UnrelEv_tree
in 
keeping UnrelEv_tree
moisture 
to 
roots 
. 
fertilize ScrEv_place_fertilizers
and 
water ScrEv_water
your 
newly 
planted 
tree 
. 
<end_of_story>_tree 
i 
love UnrelEv_tree
cherries 
. 
i 
thought UnrelEv_tree
it 
would 
nice 
if 
i 
had UnrelEv_tree
a 
cherry 
tree 
in 
my 
backyard 
. 
there 
was UnrelEv_tree
plenty 
of 
room 
in 
my 
yard 
for 
a 
large 
tree 
, 
so 
i 
decided UnrelEv_tree
to 
plant+one Evoking_tree
. 
i 
drove RelNScrEv_tree
my 
pickup 
truck 
to 
a 
nursery 
near 
where 
i 
live UnrelEv_tree
. 
they 
had UnrelEv_tree
many 
different 
types 
of 
trees 
there 
, 
all 
growing RelNScrEv_tree
in 
large 
pots 
. 
the 
trees 
were UnrelEv_tree
very 
skinny 
, 
but 
i 
knew UnrelEv_tree
once 
they 
were UnrelEv_tree
out 
of 
the 
pots 
and 
planted ScrEv_place_root
in 
the 
ground 
, 
they 
would 
grow RelNScrEv_tree
into 
large 
trees 
. 
i 
found ScrEv_choose_tree
some 
cherry 
trees 
and 
saw UnrelEv_tree
how 
much 
they 
would 
cost RelNScrEv_tree
. 
i 
asked RelNScrEv_tree
a 
man 
who 
worked UnrelEv_tree
at 
the 
nursery 
if 
he 
would 
put RelNScrEv_tree
the 
tree 
in 
my 
pickup 
after 
i 
paid ScrEv_get_tree
for 
it 
. 
i 
went UnrelEv_tree
to 
the 
cashier 
and 
paid ScrEv_get_tree
for 
the 
tree 
and 
the 
man 
loaded ScrEv_get_tree
it 
into 
my 
truck 
. 
when 
i 
got ScrEv_take_home
home 
, 
i 
got ScrEv_get_tools
a 
shovel 
and 
dug ScrEv_dig_hole
a 
huge 
hole 
where 
i 
wanted 
the 
tree 
to 
grow RelNScrEv_tree
. 
i 
made+sure UnrelEv_tree
all 
the 
big 
rocks 
and 
roots 
from 
other 
trees 
were 
not 
left UnrelEv_tree
in 
the 
hole 
. 
i 
added ScrEv_refill_hole
some 
manure 
so 
the 
roots 
would 
get UnrelEv_tree
all 
the 
extra 
nutrients 
a 
growing RelNScrEv_tree
tree 
would 
need UnrelEv_tree
. 
in 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
hole 
i 
made UnrelEv_tree
the 
soil 
higher 
in 
the 
shape 
of 
an 
upside 
down 
cone 
. 
i 
took RelNScrEv_tree
the 
tree 
out 
of 
my 
truck 
and 
removed RelNScrEv_tree
it 
from 
the 
pot 
. 
i 
stood ScrEv_place_root
the 
tree 
up 
in 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
hole 
, 
with 
the 
tree 
on 
the 
top 
of 
the 
cone 
and 
the 
roots 
spread UnrelEv_tree
out 
around 
it 
. 
this 
would 
make+sure UnrelEv_tree
the 
tree 
would 
not 
be 
standing UnrelEv_tree
in 
water 
and 
the 
roots 
could 
drink UnrelEv_tree
the 
water 
easily 
. 
i 
replaced ScrEv_refill_hole
the 
dirt 
, 
making+sure UnrelEv_tree
the 
tree 
was UnrelEv_tree
even 
with 
the 
ground 
around 
the 
hole 
. 
when 
the 
hole 
was 
all 
filled+up ScrEv_refill_hole
i 
stomped ScrEv_tamp_dirt
all 
around 
the 
tree 
to 
make+sure UnrelEv_tree
the 
roots 
of 
the 
tree 
were UnrelEv_tree
firmly 
connected UnrelEv_tree
with 
the 
soil 
. 
when 
i 
was UnrelEv_tree
sure 
the 
tree 
was UnrelEv_tree
firmly 
in 
the 
ground 
and 
would 
not 
move UnrelEv_tree
, 
i 
got ScrEv_get_tools
my 
garden 
hose 
. 
i 
turned+on RelNScrEv_tree
the 
water 
and 
slowly 
watered ScrEv_water
the 
tree 
. 
after 
a 
few 
hours 
, 
i 
watered ScrEv_water
it 
again 
. 
when 
all 
the 
water 
had 
sunk UnrelEv_tree
into 
the 
ground 
, 
i 
put RelNScrEv_tree
a 
few 
inches 
of 
mulch 
all 
around 
the 
tree 
to 
keep UnrelEv_tree
the 
roots 
moist 
and 
stop UnrelEv_tree
weeds 
from 
growing UnrelEv_tree
. 
i 
knew UnrelEv_tree
that 
i 
would 
have 
to 
water ScrEv_water
the 
the 
tree 
every 
week 
until 
the 
roots 
got 
established UnrelEv_tree
. 
the 
tree 
will 
get UnrelEv_tree
bigger 
every 
year 
, 
and 
i 
'm 
looking+forward UnrelEv_tree
to 
the 
day 
when 
i 
'll 
be 
able 
to 
pick UnrelEv_tree
cherries 
in 
my 
own 
back 
yard 
! 
<end_of_story>_tree 
when 
i 
looked UnrelEv_tree
out 
of 
my 
window 
into 
my 
back 
garden 
i 
decided UnrelEv_tree
i 
needed UnrelEv_tree
a 
tree 
to 
help+provide UnrelEv_tree
some 
shade 
for 
my 
dogs 
while 
they 
are UnrelEv_tree
outside 
as 
it 
can 
get UnrelEv_tree
very 
hot 
where 
i 
live UnrelEv_tree
. 
i 
thought Unclear_tree
carefully 
about 
the 
type 
of 
tree 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_tree
to 
grow RelNScrEv_tree
, 
i 
needed UnrelEv_tree
something 
with 
lots 
of 
leaves 
that 
would 
grow RelNScrEv_tree
quite 
fast 
as 
i 
could 
n't 
afford UnrelEv_tree
to 
buy ScrEv_get_tree
a 
tree 
that 
was 
already 
grown RelNScrEv_tree
. 
i 
did ScrEv_choose_tree
some 
research 
on 
the 
internet 
and 
decided UnrelEv_tree
that 
i 
would 
like UnrelEv_tree
a 
japanese 
maple 
tree 
with 
red 
leaves 
. 
i 
drove RelNScrEv_tree
to 
the 
garden 
center 
and 
made UnrelEv_tree
my 
way 
to 
the 
tree 
section 
, 
where 
there 
were UnrelEv_tree
lots 
of 
lovely 
small 
japanese 
maples 
for 
sale 
already 
growing RelNScrEv_tree
in 
pots 
. 
i 
found UnrelEv_tree
someone 
who 
worked UnrelEv_tree
there 
to 
advise RelNScrEv_tree
me 
on 
the 
best 
way 
to 
plant+the+tree Evoking_tree
and 
how 
to 
care UnrelEv_tree
for 
it 
. 
after 
i 
had 
paid ScrEv_get_tree
for 
it 
and 
chosen RelNScrEv_tree
some 
special 
compost 
for 
trees 
, 
they 
helped UnrelEv_tree
me 
load RelNScrEv_tree
the 
car 
and 
i 
drove ScrEv_take_home
home 
to 
plant+it Evoking_tree
. 
i 
selected ScrEv_find_place
a 
good 
spot 
in 
the 
garden 
where 
it 
would 
have UnrelEv_tree
room 
to 
spread UnrelEv_tree
out 
and 
went RelNScrEv_tree
into 
the 
garage 
to 
get ScrEv_get_tools
my 
spade 
. 
i 
dug ScrEv_dig_hole
a 
hole 
wide 
and 
deep 
enough 
for 
the 
entire 
pot 
to 
fit UnrelEv_tree
into 
, 
and 
i 
laid RelNScrEv_tree
the 
pot 
on 
it 
's 
side 
, 
gently 
tugging RelNScrEv_tree
on 
the 
tree 
to 
remove RelNScrEv_tree
it 
from 
the 
pot 
. 
once 
it 
was UnrelEv_tree
free 
, 
i 
shook RelNScrEv_tree
the 
roots 
a 
little 
to 
free RelNScrEv_tree
them 
up 
and 
planted ScrEv_place_root
the 
tree 
in 
the 
hole 
i 
had 
dug ScrEv_dig_hole
. 
then 
i 
packed ScrEv_refill_hole
the 
sides 
of 
the 
roots 
with 
the 
compost 
, 
making+sure UnrelEv_tree
the 
trunk 
stayed UnrelEv_tree
vertical 
as 
i 
was 
doing UnrelEv_tree
this 
. 
when 
i 
had 
finished UnrelEv_tree
i 
watered ScrEv_water
the 
new 
tree 
really 
well 
, 
making ScrEv_water
a 
puddle 
around 
the 
base 
of 
the 
trunk 
with 
my 
garden 
hose 
. 
then 
it 
was UnrelEv_tree
time 
to 
sit+back UnrelEv_tree
and 
imagine UnrelEv_tree
in 
a 
few 
years 
i 
would 
have UnrelEv_tree
a 
big 
leafy 
red 
maple 
providing UnrelEv_tree
lots 
of 
shade 
and 
color 
. 
<end_of_story>_tree 
i 
decided UnrelEv_tree
we 
needed UnrelEv_tree
some 
fruit 
trees 
on 
our 
property 
so 
ordered ScrEv_get_tree
a 
three 
in 
one 
apple 
tree 
from 
a 
catalog 
. 
the 
three 
in 
one 
apple 
tree 
did 
n't 
need UnrelEv_tree
other 
apple 
trees 
for 
cross 
pollination 
because 
it 
had UnrelEv_tree
three 
different 
kinds 
of 
apples 
on 
its 
branches 
. 
a 
couple 
weeks 
later 
a 
the 
apple 
tree 
came ScrEv_get_tree
in 
the 
mail 
. 
i 
opened RelNScrEv_tree
the 
package 
and 
read RelNScrEv_tree
the 
directions 
. 
i 
then 
grabbed ScrEv_get_tools
a 
shovel 
and 
went UnrelEv_tree
and 
dug ScrEv_dig_hole
a 
hole 
that 
was UnrelEv_tree
twice 
as 
big 
as 
the 
base 
of 
the 
tree 
. 
then 
i 
drove RelNScrEv_tree
to 
the 
store 
to 
buy RelNScrEv_tree
some 
potting 
mix 
which 
was UnrelEv_tree
highly 
encouraged UnrelEv_tree
in 
the 
apple 
trees 
instructions 
. 
once 
home 
, 
i 
put ScrEv_place_root
the 
three 
in 
one 
apple 
tree 
into 
the 
hole 
i 
had 
dug ScrEv_dig_hole
. 
then 
i 
put ScrEv_refill_hole
potting 
soil 
around 
the 
base 
of 
the 
tree 
. 
then 
all 
that 
was UnrelEv_tree
left 
to 
do UnrelEv_tree
was 
keep UnrelEv_tree
it 
watered ScrEv_water
throughout 
the 
year 
. 
<end_of_story>_tree 
my 
yard 
was UnrelEv_tree
very 
bare 
and 
plain-looking UnrelEv_tree
so 
i 
decided UnrelEv_tree
to 
add UnrelEv_tree
some 
trees 
to 
the 
landscape 
. 
first 
, 
i 
went RelNScrEv_tree
to 
the 
local 
nursery 
and 
asked RelNScrEv_tree
them 
for 
advice 
on 
what 
kinds 
of 
trees 
would 
do UnrelEv_tree
well 
in 
my 
area 
, 
level 
of 
sunlight 
, 
amount 
of 
precipitation 
, 
etc 
. 
they 
gave UnrelEv_tree
me 
some 
ideas 
and 
i 
picked+out ScrEv_choose_tree
a 
bradford 
pear 
tree 
sapling 
. 
i 
took ScrEv_take_home
it 
home 
and 
left UnrelEv_tree
it 
in 
shade 
while 
i 
prepared UnrelEv_tree
to 
plant+it Evoking_tree
. 
first 
i 
got+out ScrEv_get_tools
a 
shovel 
and 
dug ScrEv_dig_hole
a 
deep 
enough 
hole 
to 
cover UnrelEv_tree
the 
whole 
root 
ball 
of 
the 
tree 
. 
then 
i 
placed ScrEv_place_fertilizers
some 
fertilizer 
in 
the 
bottom 
of 
the 
hole 
. 
next 
i 
unwrapped ScrEv_unwrap_root
the 
root 
ball 
from 
the 
burlap 
sack 
which 
contained UnrelEv_tree
it 
and 
placed ScrEv_place_root
it 
in 
the 
hole 
that 
i 
had 
dug ScrEv_dig_hole
. 
once 
it 
was UnrelEv_tree
in 
, 
i 
shoveled ScrEv_refill_hole
the 
dirt 
back 
into 
the 
opening 
and 
tamped ScrEv_tamp_dirt
it 
firmly 
around 
the 
base 
of 
the 
tree 
. 
after 
that 
i 
placed ScrEv_get_tools
a 
soaker 
hose 
near 
it 
to 
give ScrEv_water
it 
plenty 
of 
water 
. 
<end_of_story>_tree 
my 
friend 
's 
yard 
needed UnrelEv_tree
some 
more 
shade 
to 
help+make UnrelEv_tree
it 
cooler 
during 
the 
summer 
. 
we 
both 
decided UnrelEv_tree
to 
plant+a+tree Evoking_tree
to 
help UnrelEv_tree
with 
the 
problem 
. 
we 
went RelNScrEv_tree
to 
the 
store 
and 
bought ScrEv_get_tree
a 
small 
tree 
that 
we 
could 
plant Evoking_tree
and 
grow RelNScrEv_tree
. 
we 
then 
took ScrEv_take_home
it 
home 
. 
the 
next 
step 
was UnrelEv_tree
to 
plant+it Evoking_tree
. 
we 
had 
to 
dig+up ScrEv_dig_hole
a 
hole 
in 
the 
backyard 
to 
plant+it Evoking_tree
in 
. 
we 
used UnrelEv_tree
shovels 
and 
a 
wheelbarrow 
to 
pick+up RelNScrEv_tree
the 
dirt 
and 
take RelNScrEv_tree
it 
away 
. 
when 
the 
hole 
was UnrelEv_tree
good 
enough 
, 
we 
planted ScrEv_place_root
the 
tree 
in 
the 
hole 
. 
we 
then 
made+sure UnrelEv_tree
to 
put ScrEv_refill_hole
back 
some 
of 
the 
dirt 
around 
the 
root 
and 
base 
of 
the 
tree 
to 
make+sure UnrelEv_tree
it 
was UnrelEv_tree
secure 
. 
after 
we 
were UnrelEv_tree
sure 
the 
tree 
was UnrelEv_tree
secure 
, 
my 
friend 
and 
i 
watered ScrEv_water
the 
area 
surrounding UnrelEv_tree
it 
to 
make+sure UnrelEv_tree
it 
would 
grow RelNScrEv_tree
properly 
. 
we 
hope UnrelEv_tree
that 
the 
tree 
will 
offer UnrelEv_tree
some 
shade 
by 
next 
summer 
. 
<end_of_story>_tree 
before 
you 
plant+a+tree Evoking_tree
, 
you 
must 
contact UnrelEv_tree
the 
utility 
company 
. 
they 
will 
come UnrelEv_tree
to 
your 
property 
and 
mark+out UnrelEv_tree
utility 
lines 
. 
without 
doing UnrelEv_tree
this 
, 
you 
may 
dig+down ScrEv_dig_hole
and 
hit UnrelEv_tree
a 
line 
, 
which 
can 
be UnrelEv_tree
lethal 
! 
once 
you 
know UnrelEv_tree
where 
to 
dig ScrEv_dig_hole
, 
select ScrEv_choose_tree
what 
type 
of 
tree 
you 
want UnrelEv_tree
. 
take UnrelEv_tree
things 
into 
consideration 
such 
as 
how 
much 
sun 
it 
gets UnrelEv_tree
, 
what 
zone 
you 
are UnrelEv_tree
in 
, 
and 
how 
quickly 
you 
want UnrelEv_tree
it 
to 
grow RelNScrEv_tree
. 
dig ScrEv_dig_hole
a 
hole 
large 
enough 
for 
the 
tree 
and 
roots 
. 
place ScrEv_place_root
the 
tree 
in 
the 
hole 
and 
then 
fill ScrEv_refill_hole
the 
hole 
back 
up 
with 
dirt 
. 
many 
small 
trees 
will 
need UnrelEv_tree
support 
until 
they 
are UnrelEv_tree
bigger 
. 
this 
will 
ensure UnrelEv_tree
they 
grow RelNScrEv_tree
tall 
and 
straight 
. 
it 
is UnrelEv_tree
crucial 
to 
keep UnrelEv_tree
the 
tree 
watered ScrEv_water
! 
it 
will 
need UnrelEv_tree
a 
lot 
of 
water 
at 
first 
. 
mulch 
is UnrelEv_tree
helpful 
to 
keep UnrelEv_tree
the 
soil 
moist 
. 
it 
's UnrelEv_tree
also 
important 
to 
wait UnrelEv_tree
until 
the 
threat 
of 
a 
frost 
has 
passed UnrelEv_tree
or 
is UnrelEv_tree
not 
in 
the 
near 
future 
. 
giving UnrelEv_tree
care 
to 
your 
new 
tree 
will 
ensure UnrelEv_tree
that 
it 
will 
grow RelNScrEv_tree
big 
and 
strong 
! 
<end_of_story>_tree 
my 
grandpa 
needed UnrelEv_tree
help 
recently 
planting+a+bunch+of+apple+trees Evoking_tree
on 
his 
property 
. 
after 
going RelNScrEv_tree
to 
the 
nursery 
, 
we 
picked ScrEv_find_place
a 
perfect 
place 
for 
them 
to 
go UnrelEv_tree
and 
made+sure UnrelEv_tree
to 
place Unclear_tree
them 
the 
appropriate 
distance 
apart 
. 
we 
grabbed ScrEv_get_tools
the 
shovels 
he 
had UnrelEv_tree
in 
his 
shed 
and 
started UnrelEv_tree
digging ScrEv_dig_hole
the 
holes 
. 
after 
digging ScrEv_dig_hole
them 
all 
out 
, 
we 
carefully 
placed ScrEv_place_root
them 
into 
their 
spots 
and 
made+sure UnrelEv_tree
to 
give UnrelEv_tree
them 
plenty 
of 
room 
and 
filled ScrEv_refill_hole
the 
hole 
with 
nutrients 
and 
very 
fresh 
soil 
. 
we 
made+sure UnrelEv_tree
to 
give ScrEv_water
the 
newly 
planted 
trees 
plenty 
of 
water 
so 
that 
they 
would 
establish UnrelEv_tree
their 
roots 
very 
quickly 
and 
grow RelNScrEv_tree
into 
very 
healthy 
trees 
. 
the 
first 
stage 
of 
planting+a+tree Evoking_tree
is UnrelEv_tree
the 
most 
important 
and 
we 
wanted UnrelEv_tree
to 
make+sure UnrelEv_tree
to 
do UnrelEv_tree
it 
right 
. 
after 
we 
were UnrelEv_tree
done 
, 
we 
put ScrEv_other_tree
all 
of 
our 
tools 
back 
and 
looked UnrelEv_tree
at 
our 
hard 
work 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_tree
a 
fun 
experience 
and 
the 
trees 
ended+up UnrelEv_tree
growing RelNScrEv_tree
beautifully 
. 
<end_of_story>_tree 
two 
days 
ago 
, 
it 
was UnrelEv_tree
earth 
day 
. 
a 
few 
people 
were 
giving+out UnrelEv_tree
seeds 
in 
order 
to 
project UnrelEv_tree
the 
idea 
of 
green 
living UnrelEv_tree
into 
people 
's 
minds 
. 
my 
friend 
and 
i 
, 
joey 
, 
decided UnrelEv_tree
that 
we 
would 
help UnrelEv_tree
to 
plant+a+few+trees Evoking_tree
in 
order 
to 
contribute UnrelEv_tree
to 
the 
efforts 
. 
we 
received ScrEv_get_tree
a 
few 
tree 
saplings 
in 
the 
mail 
from 
a 
catalog 
. 
joey 
and 
i 
decided UnrelEv_tree
that 
we 
would 
plant+them Evoking_tree
in 
our 
backyard 
to 
provide UnrelEv_tree
shade 
. 
while 
the 
trees 
might 
be UnrelEv_tree
small 
now 
, 
hopefully 
they 
would 
grow RelNScrEv_tree
into 
big 
trees 
for 
maybe 
our 
kids 
. 
we 
got UnrelEv_tree
all 
down 
and 
dirty 
in 
the 
grass 
, 
starting UnrelEv_tree
to 
rake+up RelNScrEv_tree
a 
circle 
of 
grass 
in 
order 
to 
turn+over RelNScrEv_tree
some 
topsoil 
. 
we 
had UnrelEv_tree
a 
trowel 
, 
and 
yes 
we 
called UnrelEv_tree
it 
a 
trowel 
, 
and 
we 
dug ScrEv_dig_hole
into 
the 
dirt 
to 
start UnrelEv_tree
planting+the+tree Evoking_tree
. 
we 
made ScrEv_dig_hole
a 
six 
inch 
deep 
hole 
in 
the 
soil 
, 
and 
then 
put ScrEv_place_root
the 
tree 
in 
. 
we 
finished UnrelEv_tree
by 
packing ScrEv_refill_hole
the 
soil 
down 
around 
the 
roots 
of 
the 
small 
tree 
, 
and 
then 
we 
watered ScrEv_water
it 
. 
<end_of_story>_tree 
planting+a+tree Evoking_tree
was UnrelEv_tree
one 
of 
the 
most 
difficult 
but 
memorable 
experiences 
of 
my 
life 
. 
when 
i 
decided UnrelEv_tree
i 
wanted UnrelEv_tree
to 
plant+a+tree Evoking_tree
i 
knew UnrelEv_tree
absolutely 
nothing 
about 
it 
, 
so 
my 
first 
step 
was UnrelEv_tree
to 
do RelNScrEv_tree
some 
research 
. 
as 
it 
turns+out UnrelEv_tree
, 
while 
it 
is UnrelEv_tree
possible 
to 
plant+a+tree Evoking_tree
from 
a 
seed 
, 
trees 
are 
most 
commonly 
planted Evoking_tree
in 
the 
for 
of 
saplings 
: 
small 
baby 
trees 
that 
come UnrelEv_tree
in 
pots 
. 
so 
i 
went RelNScrEv_tree
to 
the 
home 
depot 
and 
picked ScrEv_choose_tree
a 
tree 
. 
i 
decided ScrEv_choose_tree
on 
an 
avocado 
tree 
because 
i 
love UnrelEv_tree
the 
buttery 
goodness 
of 
its 
fruit 
. 
i 
carefully 
packed RelNScrEv_tree
the 
tree 
into 
my 
car 
and 
took ScrEv_get_tree
it 
home 
, 
where 
i 
brought RelNScrEv_tree
it 
into 
my 
backyard 
and 
dug ScrEv_dig_hole
a 
hole 
for 
it 
. 
after 
i 
dug ScrEv_dig_hole
the 
hole 
, 
i 
took RelNScrEv_tree
the 
sapling 
out 
of 
the 
pot 
and 
placed ScrEv_place_root
it 
into 
the 
hole 
. 
finally 
i 
filled ScrEv_refill_hole
up 
the 
excess 
space 
with 
leftover 
dirt 
and 
gave ScrEv_water
the 
tree 
a 
water 
in 
its 
new 
home 
. 
<end_of_story>_tree 
i 
bought ScrEv_get_tree
a 
little 
flowering UnrelEv_tree
tree 
at 
a 
local 
greenhouse 
. 
it 
came ScrEv_get_tree
with 
its 
roots 
bundled UnrelEv_tree
up 
in 
burlap 
, 
or 
something 
that 
looks UnrelEv_tree
like 
burlap 
. 
i 
dug ScrEv_dig_hole
a 
hole 
about 
two 
feet 
deep 
in 
my 
front 
yard 
, 
where 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_tree
the 
tree 
to 
grow RelNScrEv_tree
. 
the 
instructions 
said UnrelEv_tree
to 
leave UnrelEv_tree
the 
roots 
in 
the 
bag 
. 
the 
bag 
would 
naturally 
rot+away UnrelEv_tree
with 
time 
and 
the 
roots 
would 
poke UnrelEv_tree
out 
of 
it 
as 
they 
grew RelNScrEv_tree
. 
once 
my 
hole 
was 
dug ScrEv_dig_hole
, 
i 
moved RelNScrEv_tree
the 
tree 
over 
to 
the 
spot 
and 
put ScrEv_place_root
it 
in 
the 
hole 
. 
i 
then 
started UnrelEv_tree
filling+up ScrEv_refill_hole
the 
hole 
i 
'd 
made ScrEv_dig_hole
with 
the 
dirt 
that 
i 
'd 
dug+up ScrEv_dig_hole
. 
i 
made+sure UnrelEv_tree
the 
tree 
was 
standing UnrelEv_tree
straight 
and 
i 
tamped+down ScrEv_tamp_dirt
the 
loose 
dirt 
by 
walking ScrEv_tamp_dirt
on 
it 
until 
the 
tree 
seemed UnrelEv_tree
to 
be UnrelEv_tree
firmly 
in 
place 
. 
i 
then 
put RelNScrEv_tree
some 
mulch 
around 
the 
base 
of 
the 
tree 
in 
a 
circle 
. 
that 
's 
supposed UnrelEv_tree
to 
help UnrelEv_tree
the 
area 
retain UnrelEv_tree
moisture 
, 
which 
the 
tree 
needs UnrelEv_tree
to 
survive UnrelEv_tree
. 
after 
that 
, 
i 
took+out ScrEv_get_tools
the 
hose 
and 
watered ScrEv_water
the 
tree 
a 
little 
to 
give UnrelEv_tree
it 
a 
good 
start 
in 
life 
. 
<end_of_story>_tree 
there 
are UnrelEv_tree
many 
ways 
to 
plant+a+tree Evoking_tree
. 
one 
of 
the 
least 
expensive 
is UnrelEv_tree
planting+a+bare+root+tree Evoking_tree
. 
i 
had 
to 
chose ScrEv_choose_tree
the 
right 
tree 
for 
my 
area 
and 
my 
particular 
situation 
. 
my 
local 
nursery 
carries RelNScrEv_tree
only 
plants 
suited UnrelEv_tree
to 
our 
area 
, 
but 
since 
i 
bought ScrEv_get_tree
from 
a 
catalog 
i 
checked RelNScrEv_tree
for 
suitability 
in 
a 
sunset 
garden 
book 
. 
i 
also 
had 
to 
site ScrEv_find_place
the 
tree 
properly 
. 
it 
could 
n't 
be ScrEv_find_place
under 
power 
lines 
, 
and 
needed ScrEv_find_place
room 
to 
spread RelNScrEv_tree
. 
i 
finally 
planted+a+magnolia Evoking_tree
. 
it 
began UnrelEv_tree
as 
a 
bare 
root 
tree 
, 
and 
it 
now 
flowers RelNScrEv_tree
every 
early 
spring 
, 
even 
in 
our 
drought 
. 
first 
, 
i 
dug ScrEv_dig_hole
a 
planting ScrEv_place_root
hole 
. 
the 
hole 
was UnrelEv_tree
wider 
at 
the 
bottom 
than 
at 
the 
top 
, 
and 
had UnrelEv_tree
a 
cone 
of 
firm 
soil 
in 
its 
center 
to 
support RelNScrEv_tree
the 
tree 
. 
the 
hole 
was UnrelEv_tree
about 
five 
times 
as 
wide 
across 
as 
the 
tree 
. 
i 
started ScrEv_dig_hole
the 
hole 
with 
a 
shovel 
, 
but 
finished ScrEv_dig_hole
by 
hacking ScrEv_dig_hole
at 
the 
soil 
underground 
with 
a 
spade 
to 
undercut ScrEv_dig_hole
the 
hole 
and 
so 
the 
roots 
could 
get RelNScrEv_tree
purchase 
when 
they 
started UnrelEv_tree
to 
spread RelNScrEv_tree
. 
i 
set ScrEv_place_root
the 
bare 
root 
tree 
on 
the 
cone 
i 
left UnrelEv_tree
in 
the 
center 
of 
the 
hole 
and 
spread ScrEv_place_root
out 
its 
roots 
over 
the 
cone 
. 
i 
arranged ScrEv_place_root
the 
roots 
so 
the 
tree 
would 
be UnrelEv_tree
level 
, 
no 
roots 
would 
be 
exposed RelNScrEv_tree
, 
and 
the 
upper 
bark 
would 
n't 
be 
buried RelNScrEv_tree
. 
then 
i 
nearly 
filled ScrEv_refill_hole
the 
hole 
with 
soil 
, 
firming ScrEv_tamp_dirt
it 
lightly 
by 
patting ScrEv_tamp_dirt
it 
as 
i 
went UnrelEv_tree
. 
when 
the 
hole 
was UnrelEv_tree
almost 
full 
, 
i 
watered ScrEv_water
slowly 
, 
holding RelNScrEv_tree
the 
tree 
straight 
as 
the 
water 
soaked+in ScrEv_water
. 
then 
i 
filled+up ScrEv_refill_hole
the 
hole 
completely 
. 
finally 
, 
i 
made ScrEv_tamp_dirt
a 
ring 
of 
soil 
around 
the 
tree 
, 
to 
hold+in RelNScrEv_tree
water 
when 
the 
rainy 
season 
ended UnrelEv_tree
and 
i 
would 
have 
to 
irrigate ScrEv_water
. 
i 
used RelNScrEv_tree
no 
fertilizer 
or 
amendments 
when 
i 
planted Evoking_tree
, 
because 
our 
sandy 
soil 
is UnrelEv_tree
fairly 
fertile 
, 
and 
i 
did 
n't 
want UnrelEv_tree
to 
make RelNScrEv_tree
a 
dividing UnrelEv_tree
line 
that 
would 
encourage UnrelEv_tree
the 
tree 
to 
grow RelNScrEv_tree
only 
in 
its 
tiny 
pothole 
of 
enriched RelNScrEv_tree
soil 
. 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_tree
it 
to 
spread RelNScrEv_tree
its 
roots 
, 
and 
it 
has UnrelEv_tree
. 
<end_of_story>_tree 
it 
's UnrelEv_tree
spring 
time 
so 
i 
decided UnrelEv_tree
to 
plant+a+tree Evoking_tree
. 
i 
purchased ScrEv_get_tree
a 
small 
orange 
tree 
to 
go Unclear_tree
in 
the 
back 
yard 
. 
first 
i 
dug ScrEv_dig_hole
a 
hole 
where 
i 
wanted ScrEv_find_place
the 
tree 
. 
then 
i 
shook ScrEv_unwrap_root
the 
roots 
of 
the 
tree 
to 
loosen ScrEv_unwrap_root
them 
. 
then 
i 
placed ScrEv_place_root
the 
tree 
in 
the 
hole 
. 
i 
used UnrelEv_tree
a 
shovel 
to 
replace ScrEv_refill_hole
the 
dirt 
back 
over 
the 
tree 
roots 
. 
once 
satisfied UnrelEv_tree
the 
tree 
was UnrelEv_tree
firmly 
in 
the 
ground 
i 
dragged+over ScrEv_get_tools
the 
hose 
. 
new 
trees 
needs ScrEv_water
lots 
of 
water 
. 
i 
watered ScrEv_water
the 
tree 
until 
i 
was 
satisfied UnrelEv_tree
and 
then 
put ScrEv_place_fertilizers
mulch 
around 
the 
base 
. 
i 
also 
attached ScrEv_tie_stakes_up
ropes 
to 
secure ScrEv_tie_stakes_up
the 
young 
tree 
so 
it 
would 
n't 
fall+over RelNScrEv_tree
while 
it 
's 
roots 
were 
still 
settling+in RelNScrEv_tree
. 
i 
also 
had UnrelEv_tree
a 
canval 
funnel 
installed RelNScrEv_tree
to 
make+sure UnrelEv_tree
water 
went ScrEv_water
right 
into 
the 
roots 
where 
it 
was 
need RelNScrEv_tree
most 
. 
once 
all 
was 
said UnrelEv_tree
and 
done UnrelEv_tree
i 
stepped+back UnrelEv_tree
to 
admire UnrelEv_tree
my 
handy 
work 
. 
<end_of_story>_tree 
today 
i 
decided UnrelEv_tree
i 
wanted UnrelEv_tree
to 
do UnrelEv_tree
something 
special 
and 
plant+a+tree Evoking_tree
in 
my 
back 
yard 
. 
i 
went RelNScrEv_tree
to 
the 
gardening 
supply 
store 
and 
bought ScrEv_get_tree
everything 
i 
needed RelNScrEv_tree
to 
make UnrelEv_tree
this 
happen Unclear_tree
. 
i 
purchased ScrEv_get_tree
a 
shovel 
, 
some 
work 
gloves 
, 
and 
a 
small 
potted ScrEv_unwrap_root
tree 
. 
when 
i 
got+back ScrEv_take_home
home 
i 
quickly 
went RelNScrEv_tree
to 
my 
backyard 
to 
find ScrEv_find_place
the 
perfect 
spot 
for 
the 
tree 
. 
after 
picking+out ScrEv_find_place
the 
spot 
, 
i 
put+on ScrEv_get_tools
my 
new 
work 
gloves 
to 
protect RelNScrEv_tree
my 
hands 
. 
then 
i 
got+down RelNScrEv_tree
on 
my 
knees 
, 
grabbed ScrEv_get_tools
the 
small 
shovel 
, 
and 
started UnrelEv_tree
digging ScrEv_dig_hole
a 
deep 
enough 
hole 
. 
when 
i 
was 
satisfied UnrelEv_tree
with 
the 
depth 
of 
the 
hole 
i 
removed ScrEv_unwrap_root
the 
small 
tree 
from 
the 
pot 
and 
placed ScrEv_place_root
it 
into 
the 
hole 
. 
i 
then 
covered+up ScrEv_refill_hole
the 
hole 
with 
the 
dirt 
and 
made+sure RelNScrEv_tree
it 
was UnrelEv_tree
secure 
and 
safe 
. 
when 
i 
was 
finished UnrelEv_tree
securing ScrEv_tie_stakes_up
it 
, 
i 
watered ScrEv_water
the 
surrounding UnrelEv_tree
area 
of 
the 
tree 
and 
admired UnrelEv_tree
my 
handy 
work 
. 
<end_of_story>_tree 
i 
did UnrelEv_tree
my 
research 
and 
made+sure UnrelEv_tree
that 
whatever 
tree 
i 
was 
planting Evoking_tree
could 
survive UnrelEv_tree
in 
my 
region 
, 
since 
my 
state 
can 
get UnrelEv_tree
cold 
. 
i 
checked UnrelEv_tree
to 
make+sure UnrelEv_tree
it 
was UnrelEv_tree
okay 
to 
plant+the+tree Evoking_tree
. 
since 
my 
parents 
were UnrelEv_tree
the 
land-owners 
, 
they 
said UnrelEv_tree
yes 
. 
i 
made+sure ScrEv_find_place
to 
plant+it Evoking_tree
far 
away 
from 
the 
house 
and 
any 
piper 
or 
wires 
. 
that 
way 
, 
when 
it 
grew RelNScrEv_tree
larger 
, 
it 
would 
not 
be UnrelEv_tree
dangerous 
. 
i 
decided ScrEv_choose_tree
to 
plant+a+pine+tree Evoking_tree
. 
they 
are UnrelEv_tree
not 
as 
messy 
in 
the 
fall 
, 
because 
they 
have UnrelEv_tree
needles 
that 
they 
keep UnrelEv_tree
instead 
of 
leaves 
that 
they 
shed UnrelEv_tree
. 
i 
bought ScrEv_get_tree
a 
small 
sapling 
at 
a 
store 
. 
growing RelNScrEv_tree
a 
tree 
from 
a 
seed 
is UnrelEv_tree
more 
difficult 
. 
i 
dug ScrEv_dig_hole
a 
hole 
in 
the 
ground 
wide 
enough 
to 
hold RelNScrEv_tree
the 
roots 
well 
and 
about 
523 
inches 
deep 
. 
i 
gently 
removed ScrEv_unwrap_root
the 
tree 
from 
its 
container 
and 
placed ScrEv_place_root
it 
into 
the 
hole 
. 
then 
, 
i 
covered ScrEv_refill_hole
the 
hole 
back 
up 
with 
soil 
and 
watered ScrEv_water
the 
tree 
. 
<end_of_story>_tree 
once 
you 
have 
located ScrEv_find_place
an 
area 
where 
you 
want UnrelEv_tree
to 
plant+your+tree Evoking_tree
, 
you 
will 
need ScrEv_get_tools
a 
shovel 
to 
begin UnrelEv_tree
digging ScrEv_dig_hole
a 
nice 
sized UnrelEv_tree
hole 
in 
the 
ground 
. 
this 
will 
require UnrelEv_tree
some 
effort 
depending UnrelEv_tree
on 
how 
big 
your 
tree 
already 
is UnrelEv_tree
as 
the 
bigger 
the 
tree 
, 
the 
bigger 
and 
deeper 
the 
hole 
will 
need 
to 
be UnrelEv_tree
. 
after 
digging ScrEv_dig_hole
the 
hole 
, 
pull ScrEv_unwrap_root
the 
tree 
out 
of 
the 
container 
that 
the 
tree 
is 
currently 
sitting+in RelNScrEv_tree
, 
and 
then 
place ScrEv_place_root
the 
tree 
into 
the 
hole 
. 
if 
the 
dirt 
that 
was 
removed ScrEv_dig_hole
looks UnrelEv_tree
fertile 
, 
then 
you 
can 
push ScrEv_refill_hole
the 
dirt 
back 
into 
the 
hole 
to 
fill ScrEv_refill_hole
it 
back 
up 
. 
if 
the 
dirt 
looks UnrelEv_tree
dry 
, 
you 
may 
get ScrEv_get_tools
a 
bag 
of 
potting 
soil 
and 
pour ScrEv_refill_hole
that 
into 
the 
remaining UnrelEv_tree
area 
of 
the 
hole 
. 
good 
soil 
will 
ensure UnrelEv_tree
that 
your 
plant 
-lrb- 
especially 
if 
the 
plant 
is UnrelEv_tree
young 
-rrb- 
to 
have ScrEv_place_fertilizers
all 
the 
proper 
nutrition 
and 
environment 
to 
begin UnrelEv_tree
growing RelNScrEv_tree
. 
lastly 
, 
water ScrEv_water
the 
area 
where 
the 
plant 
is UnrelEv_tree
and 
you 
're 
done UnrelEv_tree
. 
<end_of_story>_tree 
earth 
day 
happens UnrelEv_tree
every 
year 
on 
april 
523 
. 
i 
decided UnrelEv_tree
to 
do UnrelEv_tree
something 
about 
it 
later 
year 
and 
went+out UnrelEv_tree
to 
plant+a+tree Evoking_tree
this 
year 
. 
i 
wondered+over RelNScrEv_tree
to 
a 
local 
tree 
farm 
, 
and 
bought ScrEv_get_tree
a 
sapling 
with 
a 
friend 
. 
we 
both 
borrowed UnrelEv_tree
a 
friend 
's 
pick 
up 
truck 
and 
drove ScrEv_take_home
to 
a 
place 
in 
the 
woods 
that 
we 
usually 
hang+out UnrelEv_tree
at 
. 
while 
we 
arrived RelNScrEv_tree
there 
, 
it 
was UnrelEv_tree
beautiful 
weather 
for 
the 
beginning 
of 
spring 
. 
we 
went+off RelNScrEv_tree
to 
the 
area 
where 
we 
always 
set+up UnrelEv_tree
our 
tents 
when 
we 
go+camping UnrelEv_tree
. 
we 
ended+up UnrelEv_tree
digging ScrEv_dig_hole
near 
the 
campsite 
and 
removed ScrEv_unwrap_root
the 
bag 
around 
the 
sapling 
. 
carefully 
, 
we 
both 
picked+up RelNScrEv_tree
the 
tree 
and 
placed ScrEv_place_root
it 
in 
the 
hole 
we 
dug ScrEv_dig_hole
and 
it 
fit+in ScrEv_place_root
perfectly 
! 
after 
that 
i 
carefully 
held RelNScrEv_tree
the 
tree 
in 
place 
while 
my 
friend 
filled ScrEv_refill_hole
the 
hole 
back 
with 
dirt 
. 
a 
year 
later 
, 
the 
tree 
is 
still 
growing RelNScrEv_tree
in 
perfect 
health 
. 
<end_of_story>_tree 
i 
decided UnrelEv_tree
one 
day 
to 
plant+a+tree Evoking_tree
in 
my 
front 
yard 
. 
i 
was UnrelEv_tree
unsure 
of 
what 
sort 
of 
tree 
i 
should 
plant Evoking_tree
so 
i 
went UnrelEv_tree
online 
and 
did UnrelEv_tree
research 
as 
to 
which 
type 
of 
tree 
would 
be UnrelEv_tree
best 
for 
my 
situation 
. 
i 
settled ScrEv_choose_tree
on 
a 
magnificent 
norway 
pine 
, 
as 
it 
is UnrelEv_tree
common 
in 
northern 
minnesota 
. 
i 
went+out RelNScrEv_tree
to 
my 
nearest 
greenhouse 
, 
which 
i 
found UnrelEv_tree
via 
google 
maps 
, 
and 
asked RelNScrEv_tree
them 
where 
they 
kept RelNScrEv_tree
their 
saplings 
-lrb- 
as 
i 
had 
read UnrelEv_tree
that 
this 
is UnrelEv_tree
how 
one 
should 
plant+a+tree Evoking_tree
-rrb- 
. 
i 
got ScrEv_get_tree
the 
sapling 
and 
brought ScrEv_take_home
it 
home 
with 
me 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_tree
only 
six 
inches 
high 
but 
i 
knew UnrelEv_tree
i 
could 
make UnrelEv_tree
it 
grow RelNScrEv_tree
tall 
and 
strong 
. 
i 
grabbed ScrEv_get_tools
a 
shovel 
and 
started UnrelEv_tree
to 
dig ScrEv_dig_hole
, 
one 
small 
hole 
the 
size 
of 
the 
pot 
the 
sapling 
was UnrelEv_tree
in 
. 
i 
carefully 
took ScrEv_unwrap_root
the 
sapling 
out 
of 
the 
pot 
and 
placed ScrEv_place_root
it 
into 
the 
freshly 
dug ScrEv_dig_hole
hole 
. 
filling+in ScrEv_refill_hole
the 
empty 
parts 
of 
the 
hole 
with 
extra 
dirt 
, 
i 
marveled UnrelEv_tree
at 
my 
creation 
. 
that 
was UnrelEv_tree
the 
day 
i 
planted+a+tree Evoking_tree
in 
my 
front 
yard 
. 
<end_of_story>_tree 
i 
have 
actually 
planted+a+few+trees Evoking_tree
in 
my 
day 
. 
i 
helped 
my 
mom 
plant+a+few+fruit+trees Evoking_tree
that 
she 
had 
bought ScrEv_get_tree
. 
interestingly 
enough 
, 
we 
never 
leave RelNScrEv_tree
them 
in 
the 
pot 
, 
but 
we 
never 
put ScrEv_place_root
them 
in 
the 
ground 
dirt 
either 
. 
we 
start+out UnrelEv_tree
by 
digging ScrEv_dig_hole
a 
pretty 
deep 
hole 
. 
depending UnrelEv_tree
on 
the 
size 
of 
the 
tree 
and 
the 
roots 
, 
its UnrelEv_tree
usually 
about 
a 
foot 
and 
a 
half 
deep 
and 
about 
a 
foot 
wide 
. 
we 
then 
put ScrEv_place_fertilizers
soft 
planting 
soil 
in 
the 
bottom 
to 
make+sure UnrelEv_tree
that 
the 
tree 
will 
have RelNScrEv_tree
more 
nutrition 
. 
my 
mom 
also 
has UnrelEv_tree
manure 
that 
she 
uses ScrEv_place_fertilizers
sometimes 
, 
but 
i 
let UnrelEv_tree
her 
handle UnrelEv_tree
that 
one 
. 
after 
we 
have 
everything 
set+up UnrelEv_tree
, 
we 
take ScrEv_unwrap_root
the 
tree 
out 
of 
the 
pot 
, 
and 
gently 
spread+out ScrEv_unwrap_root
the 
roots 
to 
make+sure UnrelEv_tree
they 
can 
grow RelNScrEv_tree
with 
some 
more 
space 
. 
then 
we 
stick ScrEv_place_root
in 
in 
the 
hole 
, 
and 
put ScrEv_refill_hole
more 
dirt 
and 
whatever 
around 
it 
and 
gently 
pack ScrEv_tamp_dirt
it 
in 
. 
after 
all 
that 
, 
we 
find ScrEv_get_tools
a 
stake 
of 
some 
sort 
and 
tie ScrEv_tie_stakes_up
it 
next 
to 
the 
tree 
so 
it 
has UnrelEv_tree
something 
to 
keep RelNScrEv_tree
it 
upright 
while 
it 
grows RelNScrEv_tree
. 
<end_of_story>_tree 
yesterday 
i 
planted+a+tree Evoking_tree
. 
first 
i 
went RelNScrEv_tree
to 
a 
nursery 
. 
a 
nursery 
is UnrelEv_tree
a 
place 
where 
they 
have UnrelEv_tree
, 
flowers 
, 
plants 
, 
shrubs 
and 
trees 
. 
i 
chose ScrEv_choose_tree
a 
sapling 
- 
a 
young 
tree 
- 
paid ScrEv_get_tree
for 
it 
and 
put ScrEv_get_tree
in 
in 
the 
back 
of 
my 
pickup 
truck 
. 
when 
i 
got+home ScrEv_take_home
i 
got ScrEv_get_tools
a 
shovel 
out 
of 
my 
shed 
and 
dug ScrEv_dig_hole
a 
hole 
where 
i 
wanted ScrEv_find_place
to 
tree 
to 
grow RelNScrEv_tree
, 
making+sure ScrEv_find_place
it 
was UnrelEv_tree
n't 
too 
near 
my 
house 
. 
i 
dug ScrEv_dig_hole
the 
hole 
about 
two 
feet 
deep 
, 
a 
little 
bigger 
than 
the 
root 
ball 
on 
the 
bottom 
of 
my 
tree 
. 
once 
i 
had 
the 
hole 
dug ScrEv_dig_hole
, 
i 
dropped ScrEv_place_root
the 
tree 
in 
, 
making+sure RelNScrEv_tree
the 
trunk 
was UnrelEv_tree
straight 
. 
i 
cut ScrEv_unwrap_root
the 
burlap 
surrounding RelNScrEv_tree
the 
root 
ball 
, 
and 
then 
filled+in ScrEv_refill_hole
the 
space 
around 
the 
tree 
with 
the 
dirt 
i 
had 
dug ScrEv_dig_hole
out 
earlier 
. 
finally 
, 
i 
grabbed ScrEv_get_tools
a 
garden 
hose 
and 
watered ScrEv_water
the 
tree 
, 
making+sure UnrelEv_tree
to 
give UnrelEv_tree
it 
a 
good 
soaking ScrEv_water
. 
the 
tree 
should 
give UnrelEv_tree
us 
pleasure 
for 
years 
to 
come UnrelEv_tree
. 
<end_of_story>_tree 
planting+a+tree Evoking_tree
is UnrelEv_tree
an 
important 
activity 
for 
most 
of 
us 
. 
we 
need UnrelEv_tree
trees 
to 
survive UnrelEv_tree
, 
and 
we 
need 
to 
replace RelNScrEv_tree
the 
ones 
that 
are 
being 
cut+down UnrelEv_tree
. 
to 
do UnrelEv_tree
this 
, 
the 
right 
tools 
and 
location 
are UnrelEv_tree
necessary 
. 
i 
would 
begin UnrelEv_tree
by 
getting ScrEv_get_tree
the 
striplings 
from 
a 
local 
nursery 
, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
right 
mulch 
and 
shovel 
. 
next 
i 
would 
find ScrEv_find_place
the 
right 
spot 
, 
somewhere 
with 
plenty 
of 
shade 
and 
also 
sunlight 
, 
where 
the 
roots 
can 
grow RelNScrEv_tree
and 
not 
destroy RelNScrEv_tree
a 
sidewalk 
or 
driveway 
. 
with 
the 
right 
location 
in 
mind 
, 
i 
would 
dig+down ScrEv_dig_hole
pretty 
deep 
, 
deep 
enough 
that 
it 
wo 
n't 
topple+out RelNScrEv_tree
or 
be 
dug+out RelNScrEv_tree
by 
passing UnrelEv_tree
dogs 
or 
anything 
. 
once 
the 
hole 
is 
dug ScrEv_dig_hole
, 
i 
can 
plant ScrEv_place_root
the 
stripling 
, 
fill ScrEv_refill_hole
the 
remainder 
of 
the 
hole 
with 
mulch 
and 
dirt 
and 
then 
attach ScrEv_tie_stakes_up
some 
type 
of 
thin 
but 
sturdy 
pole 
or 
stick 
next 
to 
the 
baby 
tree 
so 
that 
it 
will 
have 
something 
supporting ScrEv_tie_stakes_up
it 
until 
it 
grows RelNScrEv_tree
strong 
and 
tall 
. 
<end_of_story>_tree 
my 
husband 
and 
i 
love UnrelEv_tree
trees 
. 
in 
the 
spring 
we 
bought ScrEv_get_tree
some 
trees 
from 
a 
catalog 
and 
planted+them Evoking_tree
in 
may 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_tree
a 
nice 
warm 
day 
and 
the 
sun 
was 
shining UnrelEv_tree
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_tree
n't 
too 
hot 
because 
there 
was UnrelEv_tree
a 
cool 
breeze 
. 
we 
went+out RelNScrEv_tree
to 
the 
back 
garden 
with 
shovels 
and 
trowels 
, 
gardening 
gloves 
and 
the 
hose 
. 
we 
each 
dug ScrEv_dig_hole
a 
hole 
. 
mine 
was UnrelEv_tree
for 
the 
white 
birch 
i 
had 
picked+out ScrEv_choose_tree
, 
and 
my 
husband 
's 
was UnrelEv_tree
for 
a 
hazel 
tree 
he 
had 
picked+out ScrEv_choose_tree
. 
we 
laughed UnrelEv_tree
and 
talked UnrelEv_tree
as 
we 
worked ScrEv_dig_hole
, 
and 
the 
digging ScrEv_dig_hole
went 
quickly 
. 
the 
soil 
was UnrelEv_tree
also 
not 
too 
stony 
, 
which 
helped UnrelEv_tree
us 
greatly 
. 
soon 
we 
had ScrEv_place_root
our 
trees 
in 
the 
holes 
, 
and 
held RelNScrEv_tree
them 
upright 
as 
we 
scooped ScrEv_refill_hole
the 
dirt 
back 
into 
the 
holes 
with 
our 
trowels 
. 
we 
patted ScrEv_tamp_dirt
the 
dirt 
down 
, 
made+sure RelNScrEv_tree
the 
trees 
were UnrelEv_tree
upright 
, 
and 
gave ScrEv_water
them 
some 
water 
to 
grow RelNScrEv_tree
on 
. 
soon 
we 
would 
have UnrelEv_tree
two 
beautiful 
trees 
. 
<end_of_story>_tree 
it 
was UnrelEv_tree
arbor 
day 
and 
because 
of 
the 
occasion 
i 
decided UnrelEv_tree
to 
plant+a+tree Evoking_tree
in 
my 
backyard 
. 
i 
figured UnrelEv_tree
it 
would 
help RelNScrEv_tree
the 
environment 
as 
well 
as 
be UnrelEv_tree
an 
oxygen 
source 
and 
in 
a 
few 
years 
i 
could 
maybe 
cut UnrelEv_tree
it 
down 
for 
firewood 
. 
i 
decided UnrelEv_tree
to 
go+down RelNScrEv_tree
to 
my 
local 
home 
depot 
and 
buy ScrEv_get_tree
tree 
seeds 
and 
a 
shovel 
. 
i 
then 
went+back ScrEv_take_home
to 
my 
house 
and 
started UnrelEv_tree
uprooting ScrEv_dig_hole
the 
earth 
, 
creating ScrEv_dig_hole
a 
nice 
hole 
of 
dirt 
in 
which 
to 
plant ScrEv_place_root
my 
new 
tree 
. 
i 
got ScrEv_get_tree
the 
tree 
seed 
and 
planted ScrEv_place_root
it 
into 
the 
dirt 
and 
covered ScrEv_refill_hole
it 
into 
the 
ground 
. 
the 
good 
thing 
about 
trees 
are UnrelEv_tree
they 
are UnrelEv_tree
low 
maintenance 
and 
pretty 
self 
sufficient 
unlike 
other 
plants 
or 
flowers 
. 
i 
still 
watered ScrEv_water
it 
every 
day 
to 
get UnrelEv_tree
it 
going RelNScrEv_tree
and 
in 
a 
few 
years 
i 
will 
have UnrelEv_tree
a 
large 
majestic 
oak 
tree 
to 
provide RelNScrEv_tree
shade 
and 
a 
new 
home 
for 
birds 
and 
other 
wildlife 
. 
<end_of_story>_tree 
last 
year 
i 
moved UnrelEv_tree
into 
a 
new 
house 
with 
my 
husband 
and 
my 
son 
. 
we 
decided UnrelEv_tree
that 
we 
wanted UnrelEv_tree
to 
start RelNScrEv_tree
a 
garden 
. 
we 
planted UnrelEv_tree
flowers 
and 
vegetables 
, 
and 
we 
decided UnrelEv_tree
we 
would 
add+a+tree Evoking_tree
next 
to 
the 
garden 
. 
we 
knew UnrelEv_tree
that 
the 
tree 
would 
be UnrelEv_tree
a 
nice 
addition 
to 
the 
garden 
. 
since 
i 
was UnrelEv_tree
unfamiliar 
with 
planting+trees Evoking_tree
, 
i 
decided UnrelEv_tree
to 
look+up RelNScrEv_tree
different 
types 
of 
trees 
i 
could 
plant Evoking_tree
. 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_tree
to 
plant+a+tree Evoking_tree
that 
would 
grow RelNScrEv_tree
well 
in 
our 
local 
climate 
. 
i 
went RelNScrEv_tree
to 
the 
home 
and 
garden 
store 
to 
look+at ScrEv_choose_tree
different 
trees 
. 
a 
salesperson 
helped RelNScrEv_tree
me 
pick+out ScrEv_choose_tree
a 
tree 
. 
i 
took ScrEv_take_home
it 
home 
and 
planted ScrEv_place_root
it 
according UnrelEv_tree
to 
the 
instructions 
. 
i 
made+sure UnrelEv_tree
the 
soil 
was 
packed ScrEv_tamp_dirt
firmly 
at 
the 
base 
of 
the 
tree 
. 
now 
that 
a 
year 
has 
passed UnrelEv_tree
, 
the 
tree 
has 
grown RelNScrEv_tree
quite 
a 
bit 
. 
it 
is UnrelEv_tree
a 
nice 
plant 
that 
we 
all 
enjoy UnrelEv_tree
. 
<end_of_story>_tree 
on 
arbor 
day 
of 
523 
, 
i 
planted+a+tree Evoking_tree
. 
i 
chose ScrEv_choose_tree
a 
hardy 
colorado 
blue 
spruce 
evergreen 
tree 
from 
arborday.org 
. 
this 
website 
makes UnrelEv_tree
learning RelNScrEv_tree
about 
planting+trees Evoking_tree
easy 
. 
i 
could 
have 
chosen UnrelEv_tree
to 
wait UnrelEv_tree
to 
plant+my+tree Evoking_tree
because 
they 
come ScrEv_get_tree
in 
tiny 
plastic 
tubes 
that 
can 
be 
stored RelNScrEv_tree
in 
the 
refrigerator 
for 
when 
i 
am UnrelEv_tree
ready 
. 
the 
colorado 
blue 
spruce 
grows RelNScrEv_tree
well 
in 
my 
area 
of 
the 
united 
states 
. 
i 
'm UnrelEv_tree
not 
a 
tree 
expert 
so 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_tree
a 
tree 
that 
would 
not 
need RelNScrEv_tree
a 
lot 
of 
skill 
to 
plant Evoking_tree
. 
it 
will 
be UnrelEv_tree
many 
, 
many 
years 
before 
my 
tree 
becomes RelNScrEv_tree
a 
tall 
and 
magnificent 
giant 
but 
i 
know UnrelEv_tree
i 
did UnrelEv_tree
something 
good 
for 
our 
earth 
by 
planting+it Evoking_tree
. 
i 
am 
going 
to 
plant+a+tree Evoking_tree
every 
year 
for 
arbor 
day 
because 
i 
loved UnrelEv_tree
how 
easy 
it 
was UnrelEv_tree
. 
it 
has 
only 
been UnrelEv_tree
a 
year 
but 
my 
little 
tree 
is 
growing RelNScrEv_tree
out 
of 
the 
ground 
and 
i 
have 
n't 
had 
to 
do UnrelEv_tree
anything 
to 
tend RelNScrEv_tree
to 
it 
. 
<end_of_story>_tree 
earth 
day 
is UnrelEv_tree
a 
very 
important 
day 
in 
america 
. 
it 
is UnrelEv_tree
a 
day 
where 
we 
recognize UnrelEv_tree
the 
environment 
and 
the 
fact 
that 
we 
need 
to 
protect UnrelEv_tree
it 
. 
this 
earth 
day 
my 
friend 
patrick 
and 
i 
decided UnrelEv_tree
that 
we 
should 
plant+a+tree Evoking_tree
to 
counteract UnrelEv_tree
the 
effects 
of 
deforesting UnrelEv_tree
. 
to 
do 
this 
we 
first 
dug ScrEv_dig_hole
a 
hole 
in 
the 
ground 
twice 
the 
size 
of 
the 
root 
ball 
of 
the 
tree 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_tree
hard 
work 
, 
but 
it 
ensures UnrelEv_tree
that 
the 
tree 
has RelNScrEv_tree
enough 
loose 
soil 
to 
spread RelNScrEv_tree
its 
roots 
in 
. 
we 
then 
placed ScrEv_place_root
the 
tree 
in 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
pit 
we 
had 
dug ScrEv_dig_hole
and 
made+sure UnrelEv_tree
it 
was 
centered RelNScrEv_tree
. 
after 
that 
we 
filled+in ScrEv_refill_hole
the 
rest 
of 
the 
pit 
with 
a 
high 
quality 
planting 
soil 
in 
order 
to 
give ScrEv_place_fertilizers
the 
tree 
proper 
nutrition 
. 
after 
the 
soil 
was 
placed+in ScrEv_refill_hole
we 
stepped ScrEv_tamp_dirt
on 
the 
soil 
to 
compact ScrEv_tamp_dirt
it 
and 
make+sure UnrelEv_tree
the 
tree 
stays RelNScrEv_tree
in 
place 
. 
it 
felt UnrelEv_tree
really 
good 
to 
give+back UnrelEv_tree
to 
the 
environment 
instead 
of 
damaging UnrelEv_tree
it 
. 
<end_of_story>_tree 
last 
summer 
, 
my 
friend 
heidi 
and 
i 
were 
walking RelNScrEv_tree
through 
home 
depot 
when 
we 
saw RelNScrEv_tree
tree 
seedlings 
for 
sale 
. 
we 
had 
been 
looking+for UnrelEv_tree
a 
new 
project 
to 
do UnrelEv_tree
together 
, 
so 
we 
decided UnrelEv_tree
to 
purchase ScrEv_get_tree
one 
. 
. 
after 
making ScrEv_get_tree
the 
purchase 
, 
we 
went 
looking+for ScrEv_find_place
a 
place 
to 
plant+our+tree Evoking_tree
. 
we 
agreed+on ScrEv_find_place
her 
backyard 
, 
since 
my 
house 
does 
not 
have UnrelEv_tree
much 
of 
a 
yard 
. 
when 
we 
got+to ScrEv_take_home
her 
house 
, 
we 
found ScrEv_find_place
a 
perfect 
place 
in 
the 
corner 
of 
her 
backyard 
. 
we 
grabbed ScrEv_get_tools
our 
shovels 
and 
began UnrelEv_tree
to 
roughen ScrEv_dig_hole
the 
sides 
and 
bottom 
of 
where 
we 
were 
planting+a+tree Evoking_tree
, 
so 
that 
the 
root 
tips 
can 
penetrate RelNScrEv_tree
the 
soil 
. 
then 
we 
created ScrEv_tamp_dirt
a 
water 
basin 
with 
mulch 
and 
filled ScrEv_water
the 
basin 
with 
water 
. 
we 
were UnrelEv_tree
proud 
of 
our 
newly 
planted Evoking_tree
tree 
, 
so 
we 
made+sure UnrelEv_tree
to 
take UnrelEv_tree
many 
pictures 
. 
we 
ca 
n't 
wait UnrelEv_tree
to 
see UnrelEv_tree
how 
our 
tree 
will 
grow RelNScrEv_tree
over 
the 
years 
. 
<end_of_story>_tree 
in 
the 
morning 
, 
i 
woke+up UnrelEv_tree
to 
prepare UnrelEv_tree
for 
the 
day 
. 
after 
getting UnrelEv_tree
coffee 
ready 
, 
i 
took UnrelEv_tree
on 
breakfast 
. 
my 
partner 
awoke UnrelEv_tree
, 
and 
she 
began UnrelEv_tree
to 
get+ready UnrelEv_tree
in 
the 
bathroom 
. 
she 
was+out UnrelEv_tree
by 
the 
time 
food 
was UnrelEv_tree
ready 
. 
we 
spoke UnrelEv_tree
about 
our 
plans 
for 
the 
day 
, 
and 
what 
we 
intended UnrelEv_tree
our 
goals 
to 
be UnrelEv_tree
. 
after 
getting+dressed+up UnrelEv_tree
to 
head+outside UnrelEv_tree
, 
we 
headed+over RelNScrEv_tree
to 
the 
gardening 
store 
to 
choose ScrEv_choose_tree
a 
tree 
for 
our 
yard 
. 
both 
of 
us 
were 
hoping+for ScrEv_choose_tree
a 
nice 
japanese 
maple 
tree 
. 
the 
checkout 
lady 
was UnrelEv_tree
nice 
, 
we 
found ScrEv_get_tree
exactly 
what 
we 
were 
looking+for RelNScrEv_tree
after 
we 
got+into RelNScrEv_tree
the 
store 
. 
driving ScrEv_take_home
home 
, 
we 
could 
barely 
contain UnrelEv_tree
our 
excitement 
. 
after 
stepping+back UnrelEv_tree
in 
the 
house 
for 
a 
quick 
snack 
and 
another 
cup 
of 
coffee 
, 
we 
set+out RelNScrEv_tree
to 
the 
shed 
to 
get ScrEv_get_tools
the 
right 
tools 
. 
the 
hole 
was UnrelEv_tree
easy 
to 
dig ScrEv_dig_hole
, 
and 
the 
tree 
was 
transplanted Evoking_tree
successfully 
. 
<end_of_story>_tree 
i 
travel RelNScrEv_tree
to 
the 
local 
nursery 
to 
select ScrEv_choose_tree
a 
tree 
for 
planting Evoking_tree
, 
today 
i 
have 
decided UnrelEv_tree
to 
purchase ScrEv_get_tree
a 
flowering RelNScrEv_tree
maple 
tree 
. 
i 
ensure UnrelEv_tree
the 
one 
i 
pick ScrEv_choose_tree
is UnrelEv_tree
high 
quality 
with 
no 
rotting RelNScrEv_tree
and 
looks RelNScrEv_tree
healthy 
. 
once 
in 
my 
yard 
i 
determine ScrEv_find_place
the 
best 
location 
based UnrelEv_tree
on 
the 
expected UnrelEv_tree
height 
it 
will 
grow RelNScrEv_tree
and 
other 
plants 
in 
the 
yard 
. 
with 
my 
garden 
shovel 
i 
dig ScrEv_dig_hole
a 
hole 
at 
least 
twice 
the 
size 
of 
the 
roots 
of 
the 
tree 
. 
i 
ensure UnrelEv_tree
rocks 
and 
are 
removed RelNScrEv_tree
from 
the 
hole 
. 
i 
put ScrEv_place_fertilizers
plenty 
of 
organic 
matter 
in 
the 
hole 
to 
ensure RelNScrEv_tree
good 
growth 
. 
i 
gently 
place ScrEv_place_root
the 
tree 
in 
the 
hole 
and 
refill ScrEv_refill_hole
with 
the 
shoveled ScrEv_dig_hole
dirt 
. 
i 
place ScrEv_get_tools
my 
garden 
hose 
at 
the 
base 
of 
the 
tree 
and 
turn ScrEv_water
the 
water 
to 
a 
very 
slow 
stream 
so 
it 
will 
absorb RelNScrEv_tree
into 
the 
soil 
properly 
. 
i 
allow UnrelEv_tree
the 
water 
to 
run ScrEv_water
for 
about 
and 
hour 
ensuring UnrelEv_tree
it 
does 
n't 
get RelNScrEv_tree
soggy 
. 
i 
step+back UnrelEv_tree
and 
admire UnrelEv_tree
my 
new 
tree 
and 
envision UnrelEv_tree
what 
it 
will 
look UnrelEv_tree
like 
a 
year 
from 
now 
. 
<end_of_story>_tree 
a 
few 
years 
ago 
, 
i 
did UnrelEv_tree
some 
volunteer 
work 
in 
my 
local 
community 
. 
i 
like+giving+back UnrelEv_tree
to 
my 
community 
. 
one 
of 
the 
things 
we 
did+was UnrelEv_tree
plant+trees Evoking_tree
in 
the 
city 
. 
this 
was UnrelEv_tree
my 
first 
experience 
with 
planting+trees Evoking_tree
. 
first 
i 
had 
to 
prepare ScrEv_dig_hole
the 
ground 
. 
the 
soil 
was UnrelEv_tree
already 
in 
great 
shape 
for 
the 
tree 
so 
that 
part 
was 
taken UnrelEv_tree
care 
of 
. 
i 
grabbed ScrEv_get_tools
a 
shovel 
and 
then 
started UnrelEv_tree
digging ScrEv_dig_hole
. 
then 
it 
was UnrelEv_tree
time 
to 
plan ScrEv_place_root
the 
tree 
. 
the 
tree 
was UnrelEv_tree
small 
, 
so 
i 
was UnrelEv_tree
able 
to 
remove ScrEv_unwrap_root
it 
from 
the 
pot 
by 
putting ScrEv_unwrap_root
it 
upside 
down 
. 
i 
then 
gently 
placed ScrEv_place_root
the 
tree 
in 
the 
hole 
and 
then 
filled ScrEv_refill_hole
the 
hole 
back 
up 
with 
the 
dirt 
. 
the 
next 
thing 
i 
did UnrelEv_tree
was 
add ScrEv_place_fertilizers
mulch 
around 
the 
area 
of 
the 
tree 
. 
once 
the 
mulch 
was 
added ScrEv_place_fertilizers
, 
i 
put ScrEv_tie_stakes_up
a 
stake 
in 
the 
ground 
and 
tied ScrEv_tie_stakes_up
it 
to 
the 
tree 
. 
this 
was UnrelEv_tree
to 
hold RelNScrEv_tree
the 
tree 
in 
place 
as 
it 
grows RelNScrEv_tree
for 
the 
first 
year 
. 
<end_of_story>_tree 
it 
's UnrelEv_tree
spring 
! 
after 
a 
long 
and 
dreary 
winter 
, 
most 
of 
us 
are UnrelEv_tree
ready 
to 
see UnrelEv_tree
green 
plants 
, 
blooming UnrelEv_tree
flowers 
, 
and 
a 
clean 
cut UnrelEv_tree
green 
lawn 
in 
our 
yards 
. 
springtime 
is UnrelEv_tree
also 
an 
opportunity 
to 
freshen+up+our+yards+with+new+plants Evoking_tree
. 
taking UnrelEv_tree
this 
into 
consideration 
, 
i 
decided UnrelEv_tree
to 
make RelNScrEv_tree
a 
trip 
to 
my 
local 
lawn 
and 
garden 
shop 
. 
as 
expected UnrelEv_tree
the 
shop 
had UnrelEv_tree
tons 
of 
blooming UnrelEv_tree
pot 
flowers 
. 
i 
could 
n't 
help UnrelEv_tree
but 
pick UnrelEv_tree
at 
least 
one 
. 
i 
was 
tempted UnrelEv_tree
to 
even 
buy ScrEv_get_tree
a 
fruit 
plant 
, 
but 
decided UnrelEv_tree
to 
save UnrelEv_tree
my 
money 
and 
buy ScrEv_get_tree
that 
another 
time 
. 
what 
particularly 
took ScrEv_choose_tree
my 
interest 
was UnrelEv_tree
a 
young 
oak 
sapling 
that 
was 
hiding UnrelEv_tree
in 
the 
back 
behind 
all 
the 
potted UnrelEv_tree
flowers 
. 
i 
did 
n't 
have UnrelEv_tree
any 
oak 
trees 
in 
my 
yard 
, 
and 
to 
be UnrelEv_tree
honest 
neither 
did UnrelEv_tree
anyone 
in 
my 
neighborhood 
. 
i 
thought UnrelEv_tree
it 
would 
be UnrelEv_tree
a 
fantastic 
idea 
to 
introduce Unclear_tree
this 
tree 
to 
my 
front 
yard 
. 
so 
i 
paid ScrEv_get_tree
the 
$ 
523 
for 
the 
young 
sapling 
and 
prepared UnrelEv_tree
to 
plant+it Evoking_tree
next 
to 
my 
driveway 
. 
to 
begin UnrelEv_tree
, 
i 
found ScrEv_get_tools
a 
small 
shovel 
from 
my 
garage 
and 
dug+out ScrEv_dig_hole
a 
523 
foot 
diameter 
and 
523 
foot 
deep 
circular 
hole 
. 
i 
picked+out RelNScrEv_tree
any 
rocks 
that 
were 
remaining UnrelEv_tree
in 
the 
hole 
, 
removed RelNScrEv_tree
any 
surrounding UnrelEv_tree
weeds 
. 
then 
i 
removed ScrEv_unwrap_root
the 
tree 
from 
its 
temporary 
pot 
and 
put ScrEv_place_root
it 
and 
the 
nutrient-filled ScrEv_place_fertilizers
soil 
it 
came+in UnrelEv_tree
into 
the 
hole 
i 
dug+out ScrEv_dig_hole
. 
then 
filled ScrEv_refill_hole
the 
rest 
of 
the 
hole 
with 
dirt 
, 
gave ScrEv_water
the 
plant 
a 
little 
water 
, 
and 
waited UnrelEv_tree
for 
it 
to 
grow RelNScrEv_tree
into 
a 
big 
healthy 
tree 
. 
<end_of_story>_tree 
in 
the 
midst 
of 
a 
great 
and 
cold 
winter 
, 
the 
color 
and 
feel 
of 
the 
surrounding UnrelEv_tree
enviornment 
had 
become+depressing UnrelEv_tree
and 
lacking UnrelEv_tree
of 
color 
or 
warmth 
. 
as 
the 
days 
rolled+by UnrelEv_tree
and 
the 
temperature 
flirted UnrelEv_tree
with 
hospitable 
warmth 
i 
planned UnrelEv_tree
the 
beginnings 
of 
a 
new 
spring 
garden 
. 
one 
of 
the 
new 
additions 
would 
be UnrelEv_tree
a 
fruit 
tree 
. 
given UnrelEv_tree
the 
climate 
here 
in 
the 
south 
we 
are 
blessed UnrelEv_tree
with 
an 
ability 
to 
have UnrelEv_tree
both 
cold 
and 
warm 
types 
of 
trees 
to 
a 
certain 
degree 
. 
this 
would 
be ScrEv_choose_tree
a 
cold 
tolerant 
tree 
. 
i 
took RelNScrEv_tree
an 
apple 
from 
some 
time 
ago 
that 
i 
had 
chilled RelNScrEv_tree
seeds 
in 
the 
freezer 
for 
. 
the 
chilling RelNScrEv_tree
of 
the 
seeds 
are 
supposed UnrelEv_tree
to 
mimick 
natural 
coldness 
and 
bring+forth UnrelEv_tree
the 
seed 
easier 
. 
i 
then 
prepared ScrEv_place_fertilizers
the 
soil 
with 
fertilizer 
in 
a 
pot 
and 
planted ScrEv_place_root
the 
seed 
. 
the 
tree 
took+off UnrelEv_tree
slowly 
as 
a 
sprout 
and 
a 
few 
years 
later 
has UnrelEv_tree
about 
523 
or 
523 
feet 
in 
height 
. 
<end_of_story>_tree 
my 
husband 
always 
wanted ScrEv_choose_tree
a 
lemon 
tree 
because 
he 
loves UnrelEv_tree
lemons 
. 
for 
his 
birthday 
we 
surprised Unclear_tree
him 
with 
one 
. 
we 
went RelNScrEv_tree
to 
the 
nursery 
and 
bought ScrEv_get_tree
the 
tree 
. 
we 
got RelNScrEv_tree
it 
into 
the 
back 
of 
the 
truck 
and 
drove ScrEv_take_home
home 
. 
we 
got RelNScrEv_tree
the 
tree 
into 
the 
back 
yard 
and 
he 
was 
very 
surprised UnrelEv_tree
. 
we 
all 
pitched+in UnrelEv_tree
and 
dug+up ScrEv_dig_hole
a 
big 
circle 
of 
grass 
in 
the 
back 
yard 
. 
we 
dug ScrEv_dig_hole
a 
big 
hole 
and 
put ScrEv_place_root
the 
tree 
in 
it 
. 
using ScrEv_get_tools
shovels 
we 
filled ScrEv_refill_hole
it 
in 
with 
some 
good 
purchased ScrEv_get_tools
dirt 
that 
the 
nursery 
recommended UnrelEv_tree
. 
we 
got ScrEv_get_tools
a 
bunch 
of 
bricks 
that 
were 
laying UnrelEv_tree
around 
against 
the 
fence 
and 
lined ScrEv_tie_stakes_up
the 
bricks 
all 
around 
it 
. 
it 
's 
been UnrelEv_tree
a 
year 
now 
and 
he 
has UnrelEv_tree
quite 
a 
few 
big 
green 
lemons 
. 
he 
ate UnrelEv_tree
one 
the 
other 
day 
even 
though 
it 
was UnrelEv_tree
n't 
ripe 
. 
he 
said UnrelEv_tree
it 
was UnrelEv_tree
good 
. 
<end_of_story>_tree 
our 
back 
yard 
was UnrelEv_tree
so 
bare 
, 
so 
we 
decided UnrelEv_tree
to 
plant+a+tree Evoking_tree
to 
spruce UnrelEv_tree
it 
up 
. 
we 
decided ScrEv_choose_tree
a 
nice 
apple 
tree 
would 
look UnrelEv_tree
great 
, 
and 
give UnrelEv_tree
us 
fresh 
fruit 
when 
it 
's 
grown RelNScrEv_tree
. 
first 
we 
went RelNScrEv_tree
to 
the 
nursery 
and 
bough ScrEv_get_tree
an 
apple 
tree 
sapling 
. 
then 
when 
we 
got ScrEv_take_home
home 
, 
we 
got UnrelEv_tree
to 
work 
. 
we 
dug ScrEv_dig_hole
a 
hole 
in 
the 
ground 
big 
enough 
for 
the 
sapling 
to 
be 
planted ScrEv_place_root
. 
once 
we 
had UnrelEv_tree
the 
hole 
ready 
, 
in 
went ScrEv_place_root
the 
sapling 
. 
we 
made+sure RelNScrEv_tree
it 
was+in ScrEv_place_root
deep 
enough 
and 
was 
standing RelNScrEv_tree
straight 
up 
, 
then 
we 
put ScrEv_refill_hole
the 
dirt 
back 
in 
around 
the 
sapling 
. 
we 
carefully 
patted ScrEv_tamp_dirt
the 
dirt 
down 
so 
it 
would 
hold RelNScrEv_tree
the 
sapling 
nice 
and 
firm 
. 
once 
we 
had 
done UnrelEv_tree
that 
, 
we 
took ScrEv_get_tools
the 
garden 
hose 
and 
watered ScrEv_water
our 
new 
plant 
, 
making+sure UnrelEv_tree
it 
had ScrEv_water
enough 
water 
, 
but 
not 
so 
much 
that 
the 
dirt 
would 
get RelNScrEv_tree
too 
muddy 
and 
the 
sapling 
might 
be RelNScrEv_tree
loose 
. 
then 
we 
took UnrelEv_tree
a 
step 
back 
and 
looked+at UnrelEv_tree
what 
would 
eventually 
become UnrelEv_tree
our 
new 
apple 
tree 
. 
<end_of_story>_tree 
last 
year 
we 
had UnrelEv_tree
a 
fire 
. 
a 
large 
fire 
, 
that 
burned+down UnrelEv_tree
homes 
and 
trees 
. 
i 
felt UnrelEv_tree
lucky 
that 
my 
home 
had 
survived UnrelEv_tree
, 
but 
the 
trees 
nearby 
had UnrelEv_tree
not 
. 
i 
had 
just 
returned ScrEv_take_home
from 
a 
trip 
to 
the 
nursery 
where 
i 
had 
picked+out ScrEv_choose_tree
a 
couple 
of 
small 
fruit 
bearing 
saplings 
. 
one 
was UnrelEv_tree
cherry 
, 
the 
other 
was UnrelEv_tree
plum 
. 
now 
they 
sit RelNScrEv_tree
next 
to 
the 
car 
, 
along 
with 
a 
shovel 
. 
after 
some 
consideration 
, 
i 
pulled+on ScrEv_get_tools
my 
gloves 
and 
stepped+out RelNScrEv_tree
into 
the 
now 
barren 
area 
next 
to 
my 
house 
to 
dig ScrEv_dig_hole
two 
holes 
, 
approximately 
523 
feet 
apart 
. 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_tree
to 
give RelNScrEv_tree
them 
room 
to 
grow RelNScrEv_tree
, 
yet 
close 
enough 
to 
have UnrelEv_tree
company 
. 
this 
thought 
amused UnrelEv_tree
me 
. 
i 
places ScrEv_place_root
each 
sapling 
into 
its 
hole 
, 
patting ScrEv_refill_hole
new 
earth 
around 
it 
in 
a 
mound 
. 
the 
i 
turned+on ScrEv_water
the 
water 
hose 
, 
and 
gave ScrEv_water
them 
a 
good 
drink 
, 
tapping+down ScrEv_tamp_dirt
the 
new 
earth 
with 
the 
shovel 
.

``

i 
thought UnrelEv_tree
, 
as 
i 
smiled UnrelEv_tree
. 
<end_of_story>_tree 
planting+a+tree Evoking_tree
is UnrelEv_tree
a 
very 
difficult 
task 
. 
first 
, 
i 
went RelNScrEv_tree
to 
walmart 
or 
another 
nursery 
in 
the 
area 
and 
pick ScrEv_choose_tree
a 
tree 
. 
when 
i 
get+to RelNScrEv_tree
walmart 
, 
i 
asked ScrEv_choose_tree
the 
cashier 
for 
which 
trees 
are UnrelEv_tree
easiest 
to 
take RelNScrEv_tree
care 
because 
i 
can 
not 
take RelNScrEv_tree
care 
of 
plants 
very 
well 
. 
then 
i 
figured+out ScrEv_choose_tree
whether 
i 
want UnrelEv_tree
a 
tree 
for 
the 
sun 
or 
shade 
. 
when 
i 
picked ScrEv_choose_tree
a 
tree 
, 
i 
took ScrEv_get_tree
it 
to 
the 
cashier 
and 
paid ScrEv_get_tree
for 
it 
. 
then 
i 
put ScrEv_take_home
the 
tree 
in 
the 
back 
of 
my 
car 
and 
went ScrEv_take_home
home 
. 
next 
, 
when 
i 
got ScrEv_take_home
home 
, 
i 
took RelNScrEv_tree
the 
tree 
outside 
and 
figured+out ScrEv_find_place
where 
i 
wouldput ScrEv_place_root
it 
in 
the 
yard 
. 
afterwards 
, 
i 
dug ScrEv_dig_hole
a 
whole 
where 
the 
tree 
would 
go ScrEv_place_root
. 
the 
hole 
was UnrelEv_tree
the 
size 
of 
the 
pot 
of 
the 
tree 
. 
then 
i 
pulled ScrEv_unwrap_root
the 
tree 
out 
of 
the 
pot 
and 
put ScrEv_place_root
the 
whole 
thing 
in 
the 
hole 
i 
dug ScrEv_dig_hole
. 
then 
, 
i 
covered ScrEv_refill_hole
the 
sides 
with 
more 
dirt 
and 
put ScrEv_place_fertilizers
some 
fertilizer 
and 
water 
around 
the 
tree 
so 
it 
set RelNScrEv_tree
in 
the 
ground 
. 
<end_of_story>_tree 
when 
i 
was UnrelEv_tree
a 
child 
my 
elementary 
school 
got UnrelEv_tree
a 
grant 
. 
-lrb- 
actually 
i 
think UnrelEv_tree
it 
may 
have 
been UnrelEv_tree
a 
grant 
given UnrelEv_tree
to 
the 
entire 
school 
district 
-rrb- 
. 
the 
grant 
was UnrelEv_tree
for 
putting+in+new+shade+trees Evoking_tree
at 
the 
school 
. 
of 
course 
i 
was UnrelEv_tree
in 
fourth 
grade 
, 
so 
i 
was 
never 
really 
able UnrelEv_tree
to 
benefit UnrelEv_tree
from 
the 
new 
tree 
, 
as 
it 
probably 
took UnrelEv_tree
five 
to 
523 
years 
to 
produce UnrelEv_tree
any 
real 
shade 
. 
the 
school 
made UnrelEv_tree
a 
big 
deal 
about 
the 
new 
trees 
, 
i 
think 
there 
were UnrelEv_tree
523 
of 
them 
. 
the 
principal 
-lrb- 
and 
probably 
many 
other 
adults 
-rrb- 
met UnrelEv_tree
to 
decide ScrEv_find_place
where 
to 
put+the+trees Evoking_tree
. 
then 
there 
was UnrelEv_tree
a 
contest 
to 
see UnrelEv_tree
which 
classes 
got UnrelEv_tree
to 
plant+them Evoking_tree
. 
my 
class 
` 
won UnrelEv_tree
' 
the 
chance 
and 
all 
of 
us 
in 
the 
class 
got UnrelEv_tree
to 
take ScrEv_dig_hole
a 
scoop 
of 
dirt 
out 
, 
it 
was UnrelEv_tree
of 
course 
a 
mess 
. 
then 
a 
landscaper 
came RelNScrEv_tree
, 
quickly 
fixed ScrEv_dig_hole
the 
hole 
, 
set ScrEv_place_root
the 
tree 
in 
and 
let UnrelEv_tree
all 
of 
the 
kids 
who 
wanted UnrelEv_tree
to 
put ScrEv_refill_hole
the 
dirt 
back 
around 
the 
tree 
by 
hand 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_tree
messy 
work 
and 
he 
constantly 
told UnrelEv_tree
us 
not 
to 
push+down ScrEv_tamp_dirt
on 
the 
dirt 
. 
then 
he 
put+in ScrEv_tie_stakes_up
523 
stakes 
to 
hold RelNScrEv_tree
the 
tree 
up 
and 
we 
watered ScrEv_water
it 
. 
i 
being UnrelEv_tree
a 
child 
, 
promptly 
forgot UnrelEv_tree
the 
tree 
and 
did 
not 
think UnrelEv_tree
about 
it 
again 
for 
years 
, 
but 
when 
i 
went+back UnrelEv_tree
to 
the 
school 
as 
a 
teenager 
-lrb- 
to 
play UnrelEv_tree
on 
the 
swings 
-rrb- 
i 
remembered UnrelEv_tree
and 
was 
surprised UnrelEv_tree
how 
big 
it 
was UnrelEv_tree
. 
because 
the 
tree 
was UnrelEv_tree
out 
in 
a 
large 
open 
play 
area 
it 
was UnrelEv_tree
great 
that 
it 
provided UnrelEv_tree
a 
lot 
of 
shade 
for 
the 
children 
at 
recess 
. 
<end_of_story>_tree 
one 
day 
i 
decided UnrelEv_tree
that 
my 
backyard 
was 
missing UnrelEv_tree
something 
. 
i 
walked+around UnrelEv_tree
in 
my 
backyard 
and 
decided UnrelEv_tree
that 
a 
tree 
would 
go UnrelEv_tree
perfectly 
in 
the 
corner 
. 
i 
drove RelNScrEv_tree
to 
my 
local 
plant 
store 
and 
walked+around UnrelEv_tree
looking+at ScrEv_choose_tree
all 
the 
various 
trees 
. 
i 
read ScrEv_choose_tree
the 
tags 
and 
found ScrEv_choose_tree
one 
that 
would 
do UnrelEv_tree
perfect 
in 
my 
climate 
and 
it 
looked UnrelEv_tree
very 
cool 
. 
i 
walked+up RelNScrEv_tree
to 
the 
worker 
and 
told RelNScrEv_tree
them 
i 
would 
like UnrelEv_tree
to 
purchase ScrEv_get_tree
the 
tree 
. 
they 
loaded ScrEv_get_tree
the 
tree 
up 
and 
i 
paid ScrEv_get_tree
for 
the 
tree 
and 
drove ScrEv_take_home
home 
. 
i 
brought RelNScrEv_tree
the 
tree 
into 
the 
backyard 
and 
set RelNScrEv_tree
it 
down 
. 
i 
took+out ScrEv_get_tools
my 
shovel 
and 
dug ScrEv_dig_hole
a 
large 
enough 
hole 
for 
the 
tree 
. 
i 
placed ScrEv_place_root
the 
tree 
in 
the 
hole 
and 
filled ScrEv_refill_hole
it 
in 
with 
dirt 
. 
then 
i 
took ScrEv_get_tools
my 
hose 
and 
watered ScrEv_water
the 
tree 
in 
place 
. 
i 
took UnrelEv_tree
a 
step 
back 
and 
marveled UnrelEv_tree
at 
how 
wonderful 
my 
new 
tree 
looked UnrelEv_tree

<end_of_story>_tree 
yesterday 
, 
i 
noticed UnrelEv_tree
my 
yard 
did 
not 
have UnrelEv_tree
any 
shade 
, 
so 
i 
decided UnrelEv_tree
to 
plant+a+tree Evoking_tree
. 
first 
, 
i 
went RelNScrEv_tree
to 
the 
garden 
store 
and 
bought ScrEv_get_tree
a 
sapling 
; 
a 
baby 
tree 
. 
i 
took ScrEv_take_home
the 
sapling 
home 
and 
surveyed ScrEv_find_place
my 
yard 
for 
the 
best 
place 
to 
plant+it Evoking_tree
. 
i 
choose ScrEv_find_place
a 
sunny 
spot 
right 
in 
the 
middle 
of 
my 
backyard 
. 
i 
then 
took ScrEv_get_tools
a 
shovel 
and 
dug ScrEv_dig_hole
into 
the 
earth 
at 
the 
spot 
i 
decided+on ScrEv_find_place
. 
i 
dug ScrEv_dig_hole
a 
little 
hole 
in 
that 
area 
. 
i 
unwrapped ScrEv_unwrap_root
the 
root 
of 
the 
sapling 
and 
placed ScrEv_place_root
it 
in 
the 
small 
hole 
that 
i 
had 
dug ScrEv_dig_hole
. 
then 
i 
used UnrelEv_tree
a 
spade 
to 
fill+in ScrEv_refill_hole
the 
dirt 
around 
the 
tree 
root 
, 
so 
that 
the 
roots 
were 
totally 
covered ScrEv_refill_hole
by 
dirt 
. 
i 
added ScrEv_place_fertilizers
a 
little 
fertilizer 
in 
the 
dirt 
around 
the 
roots 
so 
that 
the 
tree 
would 
grow RelNScrEv_tree
big 
and 
strong 
. 
i 
stepped+back RelNScrEv_tree
and 
looked+at RelNScrEv_tree
my 
new 
tree 
and 
was UnrelEv_tree
so 
happy 
that 
the 
task 
was 
accomplished UnrelEv_tree
. 
one 
day 
that 
sapling 
will 
grow RelNScrEv_tree
into 
a 
large 
tree 
and 
provide UnrelEv_tree
shade 
to 
my 
backyard 
. 
<end_of_story>_tree 
my 
backyard 
was 
looking UnrelEv_tree
a 
little 
empty 
, 
so 
i 
decided UnrelEv_tree
i 
would 
plant+something Evoking_tree
in 
it 
. 
i 
decided+on ScrEv_choose_tree
a 
tree 
. 
i 
went+out RelNScrEv_tree
and 
bought ScrEv_get_tree
some 
tree 
seeds 
. 
i 
picked ScrEv_choose_tree
a 
species 
that 
i 
thought UnrelEv_tree
would 
grow RelNScrEv_tree
well 
in 
the 
sun 
since 
my 
back 
yard 
receives UnrelEv_tree
a 
lot 
of 
sunlight 
. 
once 
i 
was+back ScrEv_take_home
home 
, 
i 
brought+out ScrEv_get_tools
all 
my 
gardening 
tools 
. 
i 
found ScrEv_get_tools
a 
shovel 
and 
a 
watering 
can 
. 
with 
my 
seeds 
and 
tools 
, 
i 
found ScrEv_find_place
a 
spot 
in 
my 
yard 
that 
looked UnrelEv_tree
like 
it 
would 
get RelNScrEv_tree
enough 
sunshine 
. 
there 
, 
i 
dug ScrEv_dig_hole
a 
hole 
for 
the 
seeds 
. 
i 
put ScrEv_place_root
a 
few 
in 
, 
and 
covered ScrEv_refill_hole
dirt 
back 
on 
top 
. 
after 
that 
i 
patted ScrEv_tamp_dirt
the 
the 
mound 
of 
earth 
back 
down 
. 
once 
that 
was 
done UnrelEv_tree
, 
i 
took ScrEv_get_tools
my 
watering 
can 
and 
watered ScrEv_water
the 
seeds 
until 
the 
soil 
was ScrEv_water
fairly 
moist 
. 
after 
that 
, 
i 
went UnrelEv_tree
to 
put+away ScrEv_other_tree
gardening 
supplies 
. 
i 
planned UnrelEv_tree
to 
water ScrEv_water
my 
tree 
periodically 
. 
i 
knew UnrelEv_tree
that 
if 
i 
took ScrEv_water
good 
care 
of 
it 
, 
it 
would 
grow+up RelNScrEv_tree
to 
be UnrelEv_tree
a 
full-sized 
tree 
. 
<end_of_story>_tree 
a 
the 
church 
summer 
camp 
i 
volunteer UnrelEv_tree
at 
it 
was 
decided UnrelEv_tree
that 
we 
should 
try UnrelEv_tree
to 
make 
the 
campus 
more 
sustainable 
as 
well 
as 
beautiful 
. 
planting+fruit+bearing+trees Evoking_tree
was 
thought UnrelEv_tree
to 
be UnrelEv_tree
a 
good 
way 
to 
achieve UnrelEv_tree
these 
goals 
as 
well 
as 
letting UnrelEv_tree
the 
participants 
learn UnrelEv_tree
more 
about 
where 
food 
sources 
come+from UnrelEv_tree
. 
research 
was 
done RelNScrEv_tree
into 
finding ScrEv_choose_tree
trees 
that 
would 
bear RelNScrEv_tree
fruit 
in 
the 
season 
that 
the 
camp 
was UnrelEv_tree
most 
used 
. 
as 
well 
as 
having RelNScrEv_tree
the 
requirements 
of 
water 
and 
sunlight 
and 
soil 
work UnrelEv_tree
with 
the 
land 
at 
camp 
. 
several 
trees 
were 
ordered ScrEv_get_tree
, 
including UnrelEv_tree
a 
cherry 
tree 
. 
in 
the 
chosen RelNScrEv_tree
location 
a 
hole 
was 
dug ScrEv_dig_hole
and 
the 
tree 
had UnrelEv_tree
the 
burlap 
removed ScrEv_unwrap_root
from 
the 
root 
ball 
and 
it 
was ScrEv_place_root
placed 
in 
at 
the 
appropriate 
depth 
. 
the 
soil 
with 
a 
few 
amendments 
was 
replaced ScrEv_refill_hole
and 
grass 
seed 
was 
sprinkled+on RelNScrEv_tree
. 
the 
tree 
was 
watered ScrEv_water
as 
suggested UnrelEv_tree
and 
i 
was 
assigned UnrelEv_tree
to 
schedule UnrelEv_tree
future 
watering ScrEv_water
and 
monitor RelNScrEv_tree
the 
tree 
for 
health 
and 
insect 
invasions 
. 
<end_of_story>_tree 
first 
, 
you 
need 
to 
pick+out ScrEv_find_place
where 
you 
want 
to 
put RelNScrEv_tree
your 
tree 
. 
you 
're 
going 
to 
be 
digging ScrEv_dig_hole
quite 
a 
large 
hole 
, 
so 
you 
need 
to 
consider RelNScrEv_tree
a 
few 
things 
. 
first 
of 
all 
, 
make+sure UnrelEv_tree
you 
place RelNScrEv_tree
your 
tree 
where 
it 
wo 
n't 
mess UnrelEv_tree
anything 
up 
as 
it 
grows RelNScrEv_tree
. 
you 
want 
to 
put RelNScrEv_tree
it 
somewhere 
where 
it 
has UnrelEv_tree
plenty 
of 
room 
to 
grow RelNScrEv_tree
, 
with 
soft 
dirt 
. 
next 
, 
you 
need 
to 
gather ScrEv_get_tree
the 
tree 
you 
're 
going 
to 
plant RelNScrEv_tree
as 
well 
as 
a 
shovel 
. 
then 
you 
're 
going 
to 
dig ScrEv_dig_hole
a 
nice 
big 
hole 
. 
you 
want 
the 
entire 
roots 
of 
the 
tree 
to 
be 
covered UnrelEv_tree
sufficiently 
in 
dirt 
, 
so 
make+sure UnrelEv_tree
it 
's UnrelEv_tree
plenty 
big 
enough 
. 
next 
, 
you 
place ScrEv_place_root
your 
tree 
in 
it 
's 
hole 
. 
position ScrEv_other_tree
it 
properly 
. 
make+sure UnrelEv_tree
it 
's 
got UnrelEv_tree
plenty 
of 
room 
. 
finally 
, 
you 
can 
fill+in ScrEv_refill_hole
dirt 
around 
your 
tree 
. 
now 
you 
're 
finished UnrelEv_tree
and 
you 
can 
watch UnrelEv_tree
your 
tree 
grow RelNScrEv_tree
! 
soon 
you 
'll 
have UnrelEv_tree
a 
nice 
big 
tree 
to 
shade RelNScrEv_tree
you 
! 
<end_of_story>_tree 
my 
neighborhood 
is 
kind 
of 
boring 
looking UnrelEv_tree
since 
there 
are UnrelEv_tree
n't 
many 
plants 
, 
i 
guess UnrelEv_tree
you 
could 
say 
it 
looks UnrelEv_tree
barren 
. 
one 
day 
i 
decided UnrelEv_tree
to 
do UnrelEv_tree
something 
about 
this 
, 
so 
i 
went RelNScrEv_tree
to 
the 
local 
plant 
store 
with 
the 
intention 
of 
buying+a+tree Evoking_tree
. 
i 
decided UnrelEv_tree
i 
wanted UnrelEv_tree
the 
tree 
to 
be 
functional 
rather 
than 
just 
cosmetic 
, 
so 
i 
decided ScrEv_choose_tree
to 
buy ScrEv_get_tree
a 
small 
apple 
tree 
. 
i 
brought ScrEv_take_home
the 
tree 
home 
and 
got UnrelEv_tree
to 
work 
digging ScrEv_dig_hole
a 
hole 
in 
my 
front 
yard 
with 
a 
shovel 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_tree
hard 
work 
and 
the 
weather 
was UnrelEv_tree
hot 
, 
but 
finally 
the 
hole 
was RelNScrEv_tree
big 
enough 
to 
plant RelNScrEv_tree
the 
tree 
. 
i 
then 
carefully 
took ScrEv_unwrap_root
the 
tree 
out 
of 
its 
pot 
and 
placed ScrEv_place_root
it 
in 
the 
hole 
. 
i 
filled ScrEv_refill_hole
the 
hole 
back 
up 
with 
dirt 
and 
made+sure RelNScrEv_tree
the 
tree 
was UnrelEv_tree
steady 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_tree
a 
nice 
sight 
, 
some 
of 
my 
neighbors 
even 
complimented UnrelEv_tree
me 
. 
i 
now 
water ScrEv_water
the 
tree 
every 
day 
to 
make+sure UnrelEv_tree
it 
grows RelNScrEv_tree
strong 
. 
<end_of_story>_tree 
i 
decided UnrelEv_tree
my 
backyard 
needed+another+tree Evoking_tree
. 
so 
i 
went ScrEv_get_tree
to 
the 
tree 
nursery 
and 
picked ScrEv_choose_tree
out 
a 
tree 
that 
i 
liked UnrelEv_tree
. 
i 
rented UnrelEv_tree
a 
pickup 
truck 
to 
bring RelNScrEv_tree
the 
tree 
home 
. 
i 
loaded RelNScrEv_tree
the 
tree 
into 
the 
truck 
and 
drove UnrelEv_tree
it 
to 
my 
house 
. 
i 
grabbed ScrEv_get_tools
a 
shovel 
from 
my 
garage 
, 
and 
i 
dug ScrEv_dig_hole
a 
hole 
in 
my 
backyard 
where 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_tree
the 
tree 
to 
go UnrelEv_tree
. 
i 
poured ScrEv_place_fertilizers
some 
special 
tree 
fertilizer 
into 
the 
hole 
that 
i 
had 
bought RelNScrEv_tree
from 
the 
tree 
nursery 
. 
i 
then 
asked RelNScrEv_tree
a 
friend 
to 
help RelNScrEv_tree
me 
, 
because 
the 
tree 
was UnrelEv_tree
very 
big 
and 
heavy 
. 
together 
we 
placed ScrEv_place_root
the 
tree 
in 
the 
hole 
. 
i 
then 
started UnrelEv_tree
to 
fill+up ScrEv_refill_hole
the 
dirt 
around 
the 
tree 
. 
halfway 
through 
filling ScrEv_refill_hole
it 
, 
i 
took RelNScrEv_tree
a 
garden 
hose 
and 
poured ScrEv_water
water 
down 
the 
hole 
. 
when 
the 
water 
settled RelNScrEv_tree
, 
i 
finished UnrelEv_tree
filling+in ScrEv_refill_hole
the 
dirt 
. 
over 
the 
dirt 
i 
placed ScrEv_other_tree
a 
nice 
bed 
of 
mulch 
around 
the 
tree 
. 
i 
watered ScrEv_water
the 
tree 
once 
more 
, 
then 
stepped+back UnrelEv_tree
to 
admire RelNScrEv_tree
my 
work 
. 
<end_of_story>_tree 
i 
visited RelNScrEv_tree
a 
big 
garden 
nursery 
store 
and 
picked ScrEv_choose_tree
out 
a+tree+to+plant+in+my+garden Evoking_tree
. 
i 
wanted 
to 
pick+out ScrEv_choose_tree
a 
tree 
that 
was UnrelEv_tree
a 
good 
size 
for 
my 
garden 
space 
. 
i 
picked+out ScrEv_choose_tree
a 
tree 
that 
was UnrelEv_tree
green 
and 
healthy 
. 
the 
tree 
was UnrelEv_tree
n't 
too 
big 
so 
i 
brought ScrEv_take_home
it 
home 
in 
a 
pot 
. 
i 
also 
bought ScrEv_get_tools
a 
shovel 
and 
a 
bag 
of 
potting 
soil 
. 
in 
my 
garden 
at 
home 
, 
i 
began UnrelEv_tree
digging ScrEv_dig_hole
a 
hole 
in 
the 
soil 
with 
my 
shovel 
to 
fit RelNScrEv_tree
my 
tree 
. 
i 
picked ScrEv_find_place
a 
spot 
to 
plant RelNScrEv_tree
it 
where 
i 
think UnrelEv_tree
it 
would 
get RelNScrEv_tree
the 
most 
exposure 
to 
sunlight 
to 
grow RelNScrEv_tree
. 
i 
planted RelNScrEv_tree
the 
tree 
in 
the 
hole 
and 
then 
shoveled ScrEv_refill_hole
the 
fresh 
new 
soil 
into 
the 
hole 
to 
hold RelNScrEv_tree
the 
tree 
up 
. 
the 
fresh 
new 
soil 
will 
be UnrelEv_tree
good 
for 
the 
tree 
to 
grow RelNScrEv_tree
instead 
of 
using RelNScrEv_tree
the 
old 
soil 
. 
i 
watered ScrEv_water
the 
tree 
and 
soil 
and 
now 
i 
will 
wait+for RelNScrEv_tree
it 
to 
flourish RelNScrEv_tree
in 
my 
garden 
. 
<end_of_story>_tree 
when 
i 
was UnrelEv_tree
very 
young 
, 
my 
family 
only 
just 
recently 
got UnrelEv_tree
our 
new 
home 
. 
the 
backyard 
had UnrelEv_tree
no 
trees 
and 
little 
decoration 
but 
that 
soon 
changed UnrelEv_tree
over 
the 
years 
. 
about 
a 
year 
after 
we 
moved+in UnrelEv_tree
, 
my 
dad 
decided UnrelEv_tree
it 
was UnrelEv_tree
time 
we 
planted+a+tree Evoking_tree
in 
the 
backyard 
and 
i 
was 
able 
to 
help RelNScrEv_tree
. 
i 
had UnrelEv_tree
no 
idea 
what 
type 
of 
tree 
it 
would 
be UnrelEv_tree
and 
when 
i 
asked UnrelEv_tree
my 
dad 
just 
said UnrelEv_tree
i 
'd 
have 
to 
wait UnrelEv_tree
and 
find+out UnrelEv_tree
. 
i 
would 
n't 
know UnrelEv_tree
it 
but 
several 
years 
later 
the 
tree 
would 
be UnrelEv_tree
larger 
than 
the 
house 
itself 
. 
to 
get UnrelEv_tree
things 
started UnrelEv_tree
, 
i 
dug+up ScrEv_dig_hole
a 
small 
hole 
to 
plant+the+tree Evoking_tree
. 
my 
dad 
had 
to 
make+sure UnrelEv_tree
the 
hole 
was RelNScrEv_tree
just 
the 
right 
size 
. 
once 
the 
space 
was RelNScrEv_tree
perfect 
, 
i 
carefully 
placed ScrEv_place_root
the 
very 
young 
tree 
into 
it 
's 
new 
home 
and 
covered ScrEv_refill_hole
the 
roots 
up 
with 
dirt 
. 
after 
it 
was 
firmly 
set RelNScrEv_tree
in 
place 
, 
i 
watered ScrEv_water
the 
tree 
and 
was 
done UnrelEv_tree
for 
the 
day 
. 
<end_of_story>_tree 
it 
was UnrelEv_tree
in 
last 
spring 
, 
when 
we 
were 
taking UnrelEv_tree
photos 
by 
standing UnrelEv_tree
in 
front 
of 
our 
house 
, 
we 
felt UnrelEv_tree
like 
our 
photos 
lacked UnrelEv_tree
something 
. 
later 
we 
reached UnrelEv_tree
a 
conclusion 
that 
we 
do 
n't 
have UnrelEv_tree
enough 
green 
around 
our 
house 
. 
so 
we 
thought UnrelEv_tree
it 
would 
be UnrelEv_tree
nice 
if 
we 
plant+a+tree+in+our+yard Evoking_tree
. 
so 
we 
started UnrelEv_tree
our 
search 
on 
trees 
. 
during 
summer 
time 
a 
lot 
of 
rabbits 
come UnrelEv_tree
to 
our 
house 
and 
destroy UnrelEv_tree
all 
plants 
. 
therefore 
we 
are UnrelEv_tree
in 
need 
of 
a 
plant 
that 
should 
n't 
attract UnrelEv_tree
rabbits 
. 
we 
read RelNScrEv_tree
reviews 
of 
different 
types 
of 
trees 
. 
at 
last 
we 
reached ScrEv_choose_tree
a 
conclusion 
to 
buy 
a 
maple 
tree 
so 
that 
we 
can 
enjoy UnrelEv_tree
fall 
too 
. 
we 
were UnrelEv_tree
new 
to 
planting+a+tree Evoking_tree
, 
so 
we 
watched RelNScrEv_tree
some 
videos 
to 
get RelNScrEv_tree
some 
information 
. 
in 
one 
website 
they 
suggested RelNScrEv_tree
to 
plant RelNScrEv_tree
a 
somewhat 
tall 
plant 
rather 
than 
a 
small 
plant 
. 
so 
we 
went UnrelEv_tree
to 
home 
depot 
bought ScrEv_get_tree
a 
plant 
and 
a 
shovel 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_tree
a 
very 
beautiful 
maple 
tree 
. 
after 
reaching UnrelEv_tree
home 
i 
dug ScrEv_dig_hole
a 
pit 
just 
to 
fit RelNScrEv_tree
the 
plant 
base 
which 
was 
packed RelNScrEv_tree
with 
some 
soil 
. 
me 
and 
my 
wife 
held ScrEv_other_tree
it 
and 
kept ScrEv_other_tree
the 
plant 
in 
to 
the 
pit 
and 
removed ScrEv_unwrap_root
the 
plastic 
sheets 
which 
wrapped RelNScrEv_tree
the 
plant 
base 
together 
with 
the 
soil 
. 
after 
that 
we 
poured ScrEv_refill_hole
the 
soil 
back 
to 
the 
pit 
and 
made UnrelEv_tree
the 
plant 
to 
stand RelNScrEv_tree
straight 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_tree
a 
please 
experience 
. 
<end_of_story>_tree 
my 
husband 
and 
i 
went RelNScrEv_tree
to 
the 
nursery 
to 
look ScrEv_choose_tree
at 
trees 
. 
we 
wanted 
to 
plant+a+tree Evoking_tree
in 
the 
front 
yard 
, 
but 
we 
were UnrelEv_tree
n't 
sure 
what 
to 
get ScrEv_get_tree
yet 
. 
we 
wandered UnrelEv_tree
through 
the 
nursery 
and 
considered ScrEv_choose_tree
a 
few 
of 
our 
option 
. 
we 
did 
n't 
want UnrelEv_tree
a 
large 
tree 
, 
like 
a 
pine 
tree 
. 
we 
did 
n't 
want UnrelEv_tree
a 
small 
tree 
, 
like 
a 
japanese 
maple 
. 
we 
wanted UnrelEv_tree
something 
in-between 
. 
when 
we 
spoke RelNScrEv_tree
to 
one 
of 
the 
workers 
at 
the 
nursery 
, 
he 
suggested RelNScrEv_tree
that 
we 
plant RelNScrEv_tree
a 
crabapple 
. 
it 
would 
have UnrelEv_tree
green 
leaves 
, 
and 
would 
have UnrelEv_tree
white 
flowers 
in 
the 
spring 
. 
we 
took ScrEv_take_home
the 
tree 
home 
in 
the 
back 
of 
our 
truck 
. 
my 
husband 
used RelNScrEv_tree
our 
shovel 
to 
dig ScrEv_dig_hole
a 
hole 
in 
the 
ground 
. 
it 
took RelNScrEv_tree
him 
some 
time 
- 
you 
have 
to 
dig ScrEv_dig_hole
a 
pretty 
big 
hole 
when 
you 
plant+a+tree Evoking_tree
! 
then 
i 
helped RelNScrEv_tree
him 
carry ScrEv_other_tree
the 
tree 
over 
to 
the 
hole 
. 
we 
had 
to 
cut+off ScrEv_unwrap_root
the 
plastic 
bucket 
it 
was UnrelEv_tree
in 
. 
when 
we 
were 
done UnrelEv_tree
, 
we 
put ScrEv_place_root
it 
in 
the 
hole 
, 
and 
i 
helped RelNScrEv_tree
by 
holding RelNScrEv_tree
the 
tree 
steady 
and 
pushing ScrEv_refill_hole
dirt 
into 
the 
hole 
. 
once 
we 
had 
filled ScrEv_refill_hole
in 
all 
the 
dirt 
around 
the 
tree 
, 
we 
turned+on RelNScrEv_tree
the 
sprinklers 
. 
we 
wanted 
to 
water ScrEv_water
the 
tree 
and 
get UnrelEv_tree
it 
off 
to 
a 
good 
start 
. 
we 
were 
excited UnrelEv_tree
to 
have UnrelEv_tree
a 
new 
tree 
in 
the 
front 
yard 
. 
<end_of_story>_tree 
today 
i 
planted+a+tree Evoking_tree
. 
i 
used RelNScrEv_tree
a 
small 
evergreen 
tree 
that 
i 
had 
purchased ScrEv_get_tree
from 
a 
mail 
order 
company 
a 
few 
weeks 
before 
. 
since 
it 
arrived ScrEv_other_tree
just 
the 
day 
before 
, 
i 
had 
to 
plant RelNScrEv_tree
it 
today 
, 
before 
it 
died RelNScrEv_tree
. 
first 
i 
gathered+up ScrEv_get_tools
all 
the 
things 
i 
would 
need 
. 
i 
got ScrEv_get_tools
my 
gloves 
, 
my 
shovel 
, 
my 
small 
trowel 
and 
my 
gardening 
apron 
, 
as 
well 
as 
some 
potting 
soil 
i 
had 
bought ScrEv_get_tools
from 
the 
store 
earlier 
in 
the 
week 
. 
i 
carried ScrEv_get_tools
all 
this 
to 
the 
spot 
i 
had 
picked+out ScrEv_find_place
for 
my 
new 
tree 
. 
the 
first 
thing 
i 
did UnrelEv_tree
when 
i 
arrived UnrelEv_tree
at 
my 
spot 
was 
to 
take RelNScrEv_tree
my 
shovel 
and 
dig ScrEv_dig_hole
a 
hole 
that 
was UnrelEv_tree
523 
inches 
deep 
. 
next 
, 
i 
took RelNScrEv_tree
the 
tree 
and 
removed ScrEv_unwrap_root
that 
burlap 
sack 
that 
encased UnrelEv_tree
the 
roots 
, 
and 
placed ScrEv_place_root
the 
tree 
in 
the 
hole 
. 
i 
then 
used RelNScrEv_tree
my 
small 
trowel 
to 
fill ScrEv_refill_hole
in 
the 
hole 
with 
the 
potting 
soil 
. 
after 
i 
was 
done UnrelEv_tree
i 
used RelNScrEv_tree
the 
large 
shovel 
to 
tamp ScrEv_tamp_dirt
the 
dirt 
down 
around 
the 
tree 
, 
to 
pack RelNScrEv_tree
it 
tight 
so 
the 
tree 
would 
n't 
fall+over RelNScrEv_tree
. 
<end_of_story>_tree 
now 
that 
winter 
is UnrelEv_tree
over 
, 
our 
planting RelNScrEv_tree
season 
has 
begun UnrelEv_tree
. 
last 
weekend 
, 
i 
went+out UnrelEv_tree
and 
bought ScrEv_get_tree
a 
small 
apple 
tree 
. 
i 
found ScrEv_find_place
a 
perfect 
spot 
in 
my 
back 
yard 
for 
it 
. 
first 
i 
looked UnrelEv_tree
around 
and 
decided UnrelEv_tree
even 
if 
it 
grew RelNScrEv_tree
very 
large 
, 
it 
would 
n't 
run RelNScrEv_tree
into 
any 
other 
trees 
or 
power 
lines 
. 
next 
i 
got RelNScrEv_tree
to 
work 
with 
my 
tiller 
, 
cutting ScrEv_other_tree
into 
the 
earth 
and 
churning+up ScrEv_other_tree
the 
dirt 
. 
once 
everything 
was UnrelEv_tree
loosened 
, 
i 
took 
my 
shovel 
and 
dig ScrEv_dig_hole
a 
hole 
. 
i 
gently 
placed ScrEv_place_root
the 
small 
young 
tree 
into 
that 
spot 
, 
burying RelNScrEv_tree
it 
's 
roots 
in 
the 
hole 
i 
had 
dug ScrEv_dig_hole
. 
i 
added ScrEv_place_fertilizers
some 
coffee 
grounds 
to 
the 
soil 
around 
the 
roots 
, 
and 
then 
took RelNScrEv_tree
my 
shovel 
and 
got UnrelEv_tree
to 
work 
covering ScrEv_refill_hole
the 
roots 
up 
again 
. 
finally 
, 
i 
smoothed RelNScrEv_tree
the 
dirt 
with 
my 
shovel 
and 
went UnrelEv_tree
to 
get 
my 
garden 
hose 
. 
a 
new 
tree 
needs RelNScrEv_tree
water 
! 
i 
watered ScrEv_water
the 
ground 
beneath 
ot 
. 
smiling 
, 
i 
admired UnrelEv_tree
the 
small 
but 
sturdy 
tree 
in 
my 
yard 
that 
will 
someday 
be UnrelEv_tree
a 
large 
tree 
that 
gives RelNScrEv_tree
us 
fruit 
. 
<end_of_story>_tree 
my 
family 
moved+into UnrelEv_tree
a 
new 
house 
and 
we 
wanted UnrelEv_tree
to 
plant+a+year Evoking_tree
to 
celebrate UnrelEv_tree
our 
new 
beginning 
. 
we 
knew UnrelEv_tree
that 
the 
tree 
would 
grow RelNScrEv_tree
over 
the 
years 
and 
would 
be UnrelEv_tree
a 
great 
reminder 
of 
how 
long 
we 
had 
lived UnrelEv_tree
there 
. 
we 
chose ScrEv_find_place
a 
spot 
in 
our 
yard 
where 
the 
tree 
would 
have UnrelEv_tree
plenty 
of 
space 
to 
grow RelNScrEv_tree
. 
my 
dad 
brought ScrEv_get_tools
out 
some 
shovels 
and 
we 
all 
helped RelNScrEv_tree
to 
dig ScrEv_dig_hole
a 
big 
hole 
. 
the 
tree 
was UnrelEv_tree
not 
very 
large 
yet 
, 
but 
the 
ball 
of 
roots 
at 
the 
bottom 
made UnrelEv_tree
it 
very 
heavy 
. 
we 
all 
helped RelNScrEv_tree
dad 
lift RelNScrEv_tree
the 
tree 
and 
carry ScrEv_other_tree
it 
over 
to 
the 
hole 
. 
we 
placed ScrEv_place_root
it 
in 
gently 
, 
being UnrelEv_tree
very 
careful 
not 
to 
damage RelNScrEv_tree
the 
roots 
or 
the 
branches 
. 
we 
threw ScrEv_place_fertilizers
some 
fertilizer 
into 
the 
hole 
to 
feed RelNScrEv_tree
the 
tree 
and 
then 
we 
started UnrelEv_tree
to 
refill ScrEv_refill_hole
the 
hole 
with 
the 
dirt 
we 
had 
dug+out ScrEv_dig_hole
. 
we 
made+sure UnrelEv_tree
the 
tree 
was UnrelEv_tree
nice 
and 
straight 
and 
standing RelNScrEv_tree
tall 
and 
then 
began 
patting ScrEv_tamp_dirt
down 
the 
dirt 
. 
when 
it 
was 
finished UnrelEv_tree
we 
turned RelNScrEv_tree
on 
the 
hose 
and 
gave ScrEv_water
it 
plenty 
of 
water 
. 
<end_of_story>_tree 
a 
few 
blocks 
from 
my 
home 
they 
are 
putting UnrelEv_tree
in 
a 
small 
park 
and 
playground 
for 
the 
children 
in 
the 
neighborhood 
. 
the 
community 
has 
raised UnrelEv_tree
money 
to 
purchase UnrelEv_tree
playground 
equipment 
and 
plant+some+trees Evoking_tree
in 
the 
park 
. 
the 
playground 
is UnrelEv_tree
nearly 
complete 
and 
all 
the 
is UnrelEv_tree
left 
to 
do UnrelEv_tree
is 
some 
landscaping UnrelEv_tree
and 
get UnrelEv_tree
the 
trees 
planted Evoking_tree
. 
the 
trees 
arrived ScrEv_other_tree
with 
their 
roots 
all 
covered RelNScrEv_tree
in 
burlap 
, 
the 
roots 
of 
these 
small 
trees 
are UnrelEv_tree
actually 
quite 
large 
. 
the 
city 
has 
loaned ScrEv_get_tools
us 
a 
small 
backhoe 
so 
we 
can 
dig ScrEv_dig_hole
the 
appropriate 
sized RelNScrEv_tree
holes 
for 
the 
new 
trees 
and 
help UnrelEv_tree
move ScrEv_other_tree
them 
into 
position 
. 
the 
operator 
has 
dug ScrEv_dig_hole
dole 
that 
's UnrelEv_tree
about 
twice 
the 
size 
of 
the 
root 
ball 
and 
it 
takes UnrelEv_tree
about 
three 
people 
to 
hold RelNScrEv_tree
and 
steady RelNScrEv_tree
the 
tree 
in 
the 
hole 
as 
they 
fill+in ScrEv_refill_hole
each 
one 
using RelNScrEv_tree
the 
backhoe 
. 
we 
plant RelNScrEv_tree
about 
523 
trees 
in 
one 
afternoon 
. 
as 
the 
sun 
starts UnrelEv_tree
to 
set UnrelEv_tree
we 
have 
planted Evoking_tree
water ScrEv_water
and 
fertilized ScrEv_place_fertilizers
all 
the 
trees 
for 
the 
park 
. 
the 
trees 
are UnrelEv_tree
beautiful 
and 
in 
a 
few 
years 
will 
provide RelNScrEv_tree
shade 
to 
many 
areas 
of 
the 
park 
. 
<end_of_story>_tree 
unfortunately 
my 
poor 
dog 
just 
passed+away UnrelEv_tree
. 
he 
was UnrelEv_tree
a 
good 
and 
loyal 
friend 
who 
never 
failed UnrelEv_tree
to 
alert UnrelEv_tree
me 
if 
someone 
came UnrelEv_tree
on 
my 
property 
. 
as 
i 
was 
looking UnrelEv_tree
upon 
his 
poor 
stiffening UnrelEv_tree
body 
i 
could 
not 
find UnrelEv_tree
a 
way 
to 
say UnrelEv_tree
goodbye 
to 
such 
a 
great 
creature 
. 
finally 
i 
decided UnrelEv_tree
to 
bury UnrelEv_tree
him 
in 
the 
front 
yard 
of 
the 
house 
he 
had 
so 
faithfully 
guarded UnrelEv_tree
for 
many 
, 
many 
years 
. 
i 
went UnrelEv_tree
to 
the 
store 
and 
purchased ScrEv_get_tree
a 
black 
cherry 
tree 
. 
i 
dug ScrEv_dig_hole
a 
hole 
and 
placed UnrelEv_tree
his 
carefully 
and 
lovingly 
wrapped 
body 
in 
to 
the 
hole 
. 
i 
then 
placed ScrEv_place_root
the 
cherry 
tree 
on 
top 
of 
where 
he 
lay 
for 
eternal 
rest 
and 
watered ScrEv_water
it 
and 
staked ScrEv_other_tree
it 
and 
placed RelNScrEv_tree
a 
small 
fence 
around 
it 
. 
now 
as 
the 
tree 
grows RelNScrEv_tree
it 
will 
absorb UnrelEv_tree
my 
frind 
and 
in 
a 
sense 
he 
will 
always 
be UnrelEv_tree
there 
to 
watch UnrelEv_tree
over 
my 
home 
and 
the 
yard 
he 
loved UnrelEv_tree
to 
play UnrelEv_tree
in 
. 
<end_of_story>_tree 
i 
bought ScrEv_get_tree
a 
tree 
from 
my 
local 
plant 
supply 
store 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_tree
a 
small 
sapling 
with 
only 
a 
few 
branches 
on 
it 
. 
i 
took ScrEv_get_tools
a 
shovel 
out 
of 
my 
garage 
and 
found ScrEv_find_place
a 
good 
place 
for 
the 
tree 
next 
to 
my 
house 
. 
i 
began 
digging ScrEv_dig_hole
a 
hole 
with 
the 
shovel 
for 
a 
few 
minutes 
until 
the 
hole 
was UnrelEv_tree
about 
one 
and 
a 
half 
feet 
deep 
. 
i 
set+down RelNScrEv_tree
the 
shovel 
, 
and 
removed ScrEv_unwrap_root
the 
plastic 
wrap 
from 
the 
tree 
's 
roots 
. 
i 
separated ScrEv_other_tree
the 
roots 
and 
loosened ScrEv_other_tree
them 
apart 
. 
i 
set ScrEv_place_root
the 
tree 
down 
into 
the 
hole 
, 
and 
used RelNScrEv_tree
the 
shovel 
to 
fill+in ScrEv_refill_hole
the 
space 
around 
the 
roots 
with 
dirt 
and 
fertilizer 
that 
would 
help UnrelEv_tree
the 
tree 
grow RelNScrEv_tree
better 
. 
then 
, 
i 
took ScrEv_get_tools
a 
bag 
of 
mulch 
from 
out 
of 
the 
garage 
and 
spread ScrEv_other_tree
some 
of 
it 
around 
the 
tree 
to 
help 
protect RelNScrEv_tree
it 
from 
other 
invasive 
plants 
. 
i 
watered ScrEv_water
the 
tree 
with 
a 
watering 
can 
. 
<end_of_story>_tree 
planting+a+tree Evoking_tree
to 
bring UnrelEv_tree
in 
spring 
a 
friend 
gave UnrelEv_tree
me 
a 
gift 
. 
she 
brought ScrEv_get_tree
me 
a 
tree 
that 
i 
could 
plant RelNScrEv_tree
in 
my 
own 
yard 
and 
enjoy UnrelEv_tree
for 
years 
to 
come UnrelEv_tree
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_tree
a 
douglas 
fir 
evergreen 
tree 
. 
spring 
had 
come UnrelEv_tree
a 
few 
weeks 
before 
and 
the 
temperatures 
were UnrelEv_tree
mild 
again 
. 
one 
sunny 
day 
, 
i 
decided UnrelEv_tree
to 
plant+my+tree Evoking_tree
. 
i 
planted RelNScrEv_tree
my 
tree 
in 
my 
backyard 
. 
it 
seemed UnrelEv_tree
to 
be ScrEv_find_place
the 
best 
place 
for 
it 
. 
i 
looked+forward UnrelEv_tree
to 
when 
the 
tree 
grew RelNScrEv_tree
and 
provided RelNScrEv_tree
shade 
and 
beauty 
to 
the 
landscape 
. 
i 
was 
so 
inspired UnrelEv_tree
by 
planting RelNScrEv_tree
this 
tree 
that 
i 
decided UnrelEv_tree
that 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_tree
to 
plant RelNScrEv_tree
a 
few 
more 
trees 
. 
i 
went ScrEv_other_tree
to 
a 
local 
nursery 
and 
picked ScrEv_choose_tree
out 
three 
more 
varieties 
of 
trees 
that 
would 
grow RelNScrEv_tree
well 
in 
my 
local 
area 
. 
i 
took ScrEv_take_home
them 
home 
and 
planted RelNScrEv_tree
them 
as 
long 
. 
in 
a 
few 
years 
, 
my 
backyard 
will 
be UnrelEv_tree
even 
more 
beautiful 
than 
it 
is UnrelEv_tree
today 
due 
to 
the 
short 
amount 
of 
time 
that 
it 
took UnrelEv_tree
me 
to 
plant RelNScrEv_tree
a 
few 
trees 
. 
<end_of_story>_tree 
last 
fourth 
of 
july 
we 
had UnrelEv_tree
a 
nice 
family 
dinner 
outside 
. 
unfortunately 
the 
sun 
was UnrelEv_tree
so 
hot 
and 
we 
had 
nothing 
to 
provide UnrelEv_tree
us 
shade 
. 
this 
year 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_tree
to 
do 
something 
different 
so 
i 
decided UnrelEv_tree
to 
plant+a+tree Evoking_tree
right 
where 
the 
table 
was UnrelEv_tree
outside 
. 
maybe 
this 
year 
we 
would 
have UnrelEv_tree
some 
shade 
to 
keep UnrelEv_tree
us 
cool 
. 
i 
went ScrEv_other_tree
to 
the 
local 
farmer 
, 
farmer 
jack 
and 
asked RelNScrEv_tree
him 
if 
he 
could 
help RelNScrEv_tree
me 
out 
. 
he 
told UnrelEv_tree
me 
that 
i 
would 
want UnrelEv_tree
to 
grow RelNScrEv_tree
a 
nice 
oak 
tree 
right 
by 
that 
table 
. 
he 
was 
able 
to 
give 
me 
some 
seeds 
to 
use RelNScrEv_tree
so 
i 
could 
make UnrelEv_tree
my 
plan 
happen UnrelEv_tree
. 
i 
used RelNScrEv_tree
a 
small 
gardening 
tool 
to 
dig ScrEv_dig_hole
up 
some 
dirt 
. 
i 
placed ScrEv_other_tree
the 
seeds 
inside 
the 
dirt 
and 
then 
covered UnrelEv_tree
it 
up 
again 
. 
i 
took ScrEv_get_tools
a 
watering 
can 
and 
filled RelNScrEv_tree
it 
up 
with 
water 
from 
the 
hose 
. 
i 
watered ScrEv_water
the 
dirt 
where 
the 
seeds 
were UnrelEv_tree
and 
did ScrEv_water
this 
every 
day 
without 
fail 
. 
i 
've 
started UnrelEv_tree
to 
see 
a 
tree 
sprouting RelNScrEv_tree
and 
am 
excited UnrelEv_tree
for 
fourth 
of 
july 
to 
get UnrelEv_tree
here 
. 
<end_of_story>_tree 
in 
a 
few 
weeks 
, 
places 
around 
the 
world 
will 
be 
celebrating UnrelEv_tree
earth 
day 
, 
a 
global 
event 
promoting 
environment 
protection 
. 
i 
will 
, 
as 
i 
do UnrelEv_tree
every 
year 
, 
meet+up UnrelEv_tree
with 
some 
friends 
who 
live UnrelEv_tree
close 
by 
and 
spend UnrelEv_tree
the 
day 
at 
the 
park 
. 
we 
will 
have UnrelEv_tree
a 
picnic 
, 
eat UnrelEv_tree
some 
food 
and 
drink UnrelEv_tree
a 
few 
beers 
, 
play UnrelEv_tree
frisbee 
and 
toss UnrelEv_tree
around 
a 
football 
and 
at 
some 
point 
, 
we 
will 
plant+trees Evoking_tree
off 
to 
the 
side 
of 
the

. 
we 
will 
plant+these+trees Evoking_tree
in 
an 
effort 
to 
promote RelNScrEv_tree
environmental 
sustainability 
, 
and 
to 
do 
our 
part 
as 
one 
in 
a 
millions 
' 
chance

damage 
is 
being 
caused UnrelEv_tree
to 
the 
environment 
and 
local 
ecosystems 
at 
an 
alarming 
rate 
and 
we 
should 
all 
join+together UnrelEv_tree
to 
do UnrelEv_tree
what 
we 
can 
in 
promoting UnrelEv_tree
awareness 
and 
getting UnrelEv_tree
the 
word 
out 
that 
we 
need 
to 
change UnrelEv_tree
our 
ways 
to 
help+protect UnrelEv_tree
our 
environment 
. 
planting+a+tree Evoking_tree
is 
my 
small 
contribution 
. 
<end_of_story>_tree 
in 
the 
late 
spring 
, 
i 
bought ScrEv_get_tree
a 
beautiful 
little 
tree 
from 
a 
nursery 
. 
the 
workers 
there 
helped UnrelEv_tree
me 
find ScrEv_choose_tree
a 
type 
of 
tree 
that 
would 
grow RelNScrEv_tree
tall 
and 
give RelNScrEv_tree
good 
shade 
in 
the 
summer 
. 
when 
i 
went ScrEv_take_home
home 
, 
i 
thought ScrEv_find_place
about 
the 
best 
place 
in 
my 
backyard 
to 
put RelNScrEv_tree
the 
tree 
. 
the 
tree 
's 
roots 
were 
tied+up RelNScrEv_tree
in 
a 
little 
bag 
with 
some 
potting 
soil 
to 
give ScrEv_water
it 
water 
and 
nutrients 
for 
a 
little 
while 
, 
but 
it 
had 
to 
be 
put RelNScrEv_tree
in 
the 
ground 
soon 
to 
keep UnrelEv_tree
it 
healthy 
. 
i 
went UnrelEv_tree
to 
my 
garden 
shed 
and 
got ScrEv_get_tools
some 
tools 
so 
i 
could 
plant RelNScrEv_tree
it 
as 
soon 
as 
possible 
. 
first 
i 
got ScrEv_get_tools
a 
big 
wheelbarrow 
to 
help UnrelEv_tree
me 
carry ScrEv_get_tools
everything 
i 
needed 
. 
in 
the 
wheelbarrow 
, 
i 
put ScrEv_other_tree
the 
little 
tree 
, 
a 
shovel 
, 
a 
big 
watering 
can 
, 
and 
a 
garden 
rake 
. 
then 
i 
pushed ScrEv_other_tree
it 
to 
the 
spot 
in 
my 
yard 
that 
i 
wanted 
to 
put RelNScrEv_tree
the 
tree 
. 
i 
took ScrEv_other_tree
the 
tree 
and 
all 
the 
tools 
out 
of 
the 
wheelbarrow 
, 
except 
for 
the 
shovel 
. 
then 
i 
pushed UnrelEv_tree
my 
wheelbarrow 
to 
my 
compost 
bin 
at 
the 
other 
side 
of 
my 
garden 
. 
i 
one 
by 
one 
, 
i 
scooped ScrEv_other_tree
a 
shovelful 
of 
compost 
into 
my 
wheelbarrow 
until 
there 
was UnrelEv_tree
enough 
to 
fill UnrelEv_tree
a 
couple 
of 
buckets 
. 
the 
compost 
would 
help RelNScrEv_tree
the 
tree 
get UnrelEv_tree
a 
head 
start 
on 
growing RelNScrEv_tree
tall 
and 
healthy 
. 
i 
pushed ScrEv_other_tree
the 
wheelbarrow 
back 
to 
where 
i 
wanted 
to 
plant RelNScrEv_tree
the 
tree 
. 
next 
, 
i 
had 
to 
dig ScrEv_dig_hole
a 
hole 
so 
the 
tree 
would 
be UnrelEv_tree
secure 
in 
the 
ground 
. 
i 
stuck ScrEv_dig_hole
the 
tip 
of 
the 
shovel 
in 
the 
ground 
and 
pushed+down ScrEv_dig_hole
hard 
on 
it 
with 
my 
foot 
. 
the 
ground 
gave UnrelEv_tree
way 
, 
and 
i 
was 
able 
to 
scoop ScrEv_dig_hole
the 
dirt 
out 
of 
the 
way 
. 
i 
did ScrEv_dig_hole
this 
until 
i 
had 
a 
round 
hole 
over 
two 
feet 
deep 
. 
i 
put ScrEv_place_root
the 
tree 
in 
the 
hole 
, 
but 
it 
would 
not 
stand+up RelNScrEv_tree
straight 
, 
and 
instead 
leaned RelNScrEv_tree
on 
one 
side 
of 
the 
hole 
. 
i 
slowly 
scooped ScrEv_refill_hole
compost 
and 
dirt 
into 
the 
hole 
, 
carefully 
adjusting ScrEv_other_tree
the 
tree 
to 
stand RelNScrEv_tree
upright 
again 
after 
each 
shovelful 
. 
i 
patted ScrEv_tamp_dirt
the 
earth 
down 
to 
keep UnrelEv_tree
it 
compact 
. 
after 
a 
lot 
of 
hard 
work 
, 
the 
hole 
was 
finally 
filled ScrEv_refill_hole
with 
dirt 
and 
compost 
, 
and 
the 
tree 
was 
standing RelNScrEv_tree
upright 
and 
strong 
. 
i 
smoothed ScrEv_other_tree
over 
the 
dirt 
and 
compost 
with 
my 
garden 
rake 
, 
then 
filled+up ScrEv_other_tree
the 
watering 
can 
with 
water 
from 
a 
hose 
. 
i 
slowly 
poured ScrEv_water
the 
water 
over 
the 
freshly 
raked RelNScrEv_tree
dirt 
, 
letting UnrelEv_tree
the 
water 
soak UnrelEv_tree
into 
the 
ground 
. 
the 
tree 
was 
planted RelNScrEv_tree
and 
ready 
to 
grow RelNScrEv_tree
! 
<end_of_story>_tree 
first 
we 
began UnrelEv_tree
by 
going ScrEv_other_tree
to 
the 
orchard 
and 
picking ScrEv_choose_tree
the 
best 
tree 
we 
could 
find ScrEv_choose_tree
, 
this 
however 
did 
not 
satisfy UnrelEv_tree
the 
little 
ones 
so 
we 
had 
to 
go ScrEv_get_tree
with 
the 
tree 
that 
they 
picked ScrEv_choose_tree
out 
. 
we 
drove ScrEv_take_home
back 
home 
with 
the 
tree 
on 
top 
of 
the 
car 
to 
begin UnrelEv_tree
the 
planting RelNScrEv_tree
. 
starting+off UnrelEv_tree
i 
dug RelNScrEv_tree
a 
medium 
sized RelNScrEv_tree
hole 
where 
we 
could 
plant RelNScrEv_tree
the 
tree 
and 
it 
could 
grow RelNScrEv_tree
as 
much 
as 
it 
wanted UnrelEv_tree
. 
we 
fertilized ScrEv_place_fertilizers
the 
ground 
where 
the 
tree 
would 
be 
planted RelNScrEv_tree
and 
began UnrelEv_tree
the 
transfer 
of 
the 
tree 
. 
this 
tree 
was 
then 
checked ScrEv_other_tree
daily 
on 
its 
progress 
and 
to 
be 
watered ScrEv_water
. 
the 
tree 
's 
health 
was UnrelEv_tree
a 
priority 
of 
our 
family 
and 
we 
kept RelNScrEv_tree
it 
in 
spectacular 
condition 
. 
this 
tree 
now 
stands RelNScrEv_tree
tall 
over 
our 
house 
to 
protect RelNScrEv_tree
it 
from 
the 
sun 
and 
allow RelNScrEv_tree
us 
the 
shade 
we 
need UnrelEv_tree
when 
we 
would 
like UnrelEv_tree
to 
play UnrelEv_tree
outside 
. 
this 
tree 
is UnrelEv_tree
the 
foundation 
of 
our 
family 
and 
we 
use UnrelEv_tree
it 
to 
show UnrelEv_tree
our 
togetherness 
. 
<end_of_story>_tree 
over 
the 
summer 
, 
my 
friend 
and 
i 
decided UnrelEv_tree
to 
plant+a+tree Evoking_tree
. 
we 
always 
wanted UnrelEv_tree
to 
plant+one Evoking_tree
but 
we 
never 
had UnrelEv_tree
the 
time 
to 
do UnrelEv_tree
it 
. 
now 
we 
had UnrelEv_tree
the 
time 
and 
we 
were 
determined UnrelEv_tree
to 
plant+the+tree Evoking_tree
. 
we 
decided UnrelEv_tree
to 
plant+the+tree Evoking_tree
in 
my 
backyard 
since 
i 
have 
the 
bigger 
backyard 
. 
we 
, 
first 
, 
got 
all 
of 
our 
utensils 
and 
started UnrelEv_tree
planting+the+tree Evoking_tree
. 
we 
dug ScrEv_dig_hole
a 
hole 
and 
poured ScrEv_other_tree
the 
seeds 
inside 
the 
hole 
. 
we 
covered ScrEv_refill_hole
it 
up 
with 
dirt 
. 
we 
then 
poured ScrEv_water
water 
over 
it 
. 
every 
day 
, 
we 
would 
water ScrEv_water
the 
seed 
. 
we 
always 
hoped UnrelEv_tree
that 
the 
tree 
will 
miraculousy 
grow RelNScrEv_tree
in 
weeks 
but 
we 
knew UnrelEv_tree
that 
was UnrelEv_tree
n't 
possible 
. 
it 
would 
take RelNScrEv_tree
years 
for 
it 
to 
grow RelNScrEv_tree
. 
we 
were UnrelEv_tree
so 
happy 
about 
planting+our+first+tree Evoking_tree
that 
we 
decided UnrelEv_tree
to 
help UnrelEv_tree
our 
community 
parks 
now 
. 
we 
decided UnrelEv_tree
to 
help UnrelEv_tree
plant+trees Evoking_tree
there 
as 
well 
. 
it 
may 
take RelNScrEv_tree
years 
, 
but 
we 
know 
that 
we 
are 
contributing UnrelEv_tree
to 
our 
environment 
. 
<end_of_story>_tree 
my 
parents 
had 
purchased ScrEv_get_tree
a 
new 
lemon 
tree 
that 
they 
wanted UnrelEv_tree
to 
plant RelNScrEv_tree
, 
so 
i 
went UnrelEv_tree
to 
their 
house 
to 
help UnrelEv_tree
them 
plant RelNScrEv_tree
it 
. 
my 
dad 
already 
had 
a 
place 
picked+out ScrEv_find_place
to 
put RelNScrEv_tree
the 
tree 
, 
so 
we 
went RelNScrEv_tree
to 
work 
. 
we 
had 
to 
dig ScrEv_dig_hole
a 
fairly 
large 
hole 
and 
it 
took RelNScrEv_tree
several 
hours 
. 
we 
had 
to 
take ScrEv_other_tree
a 
break 
half 
way 
through 
because 
it 
was UnrelEv_tree
rather 
tiring 
. 
after 
the 
water 
break 
, 
we 
finished UnrelEv_tree
digging ScrEv_dig_hole
and 
we 
tested ScrEv_other_tree
the 
depth 
by 
setting ScrEv_place_root
the 
bundled RelNScrEv_tree
roots 
into 
the 
hole 
to 
make+sure UnrelEv_tree
that 
it 
was UnrelEv_tree
deep 
enough 
. 
since 
it 
was 
, 
i 
added ScrEv_place_fertilizers
some 
of 
the 
nutrient 
rich 
soil 
additives 
into 
the 
bottom 
of 
the 
hole 
and 
my 
dad 
watered ScrEv_water
the 
soil 
additives 
with 
the 
garden 
hose 
. 
we 
then 
cut ScrEv_unwrap_root
the 
burlap 
off 
that 
had 
covered RelNScrEv_tree
the 
roots 
and 
carefully 
set ScrEv_place_root
the 
tree 
into 
the 
hole 
. 
we 
took ScrEv_other_tree
another 
break 
and 
then 
set+in UnrelEv_tree
to 
refilling ScrEv_refill_hole
the 
hole 
with 
dirt 
. 
it 
took RelNScrEv_tree
a 
long 
time 
to 
do UnrelEv_tree
, 
but 
it 
was UnrelEv_tree
well 
worth 
it 
. 
i 
left UnrelEv_tree
the 
hose 
turned RelNScrEv_tree
on 
at 
the 
base 
of 
the 
tree 
so 
that 
it 
could 
get UnrelEv_tree
properly 
soaked RelNScrEv_tree
and 
we 
went UnrelEv_tree
back 
into 
the 
house 
to 
properly 
cool+off UnrelEv_tree
. 
<end_of_story>_tree 
since 
it 
's 
spring 
now 
, 
i 
decided UnrelEv_tree
that 
my 
yard 
needed UnrelEv_tree
another 
tree 
in 
it 
. 
i 
walked UnrelEv_tree
around 
the 
yard 
for 
a 
while 
deciding ScrEv_find_place
where 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_tree
to 
put 
it 
. 
once 
i 
picked ScrEv_find_place
the 
spot 
out 
, 
i 
got UnrelEv_tree
online 
and 
looked+up ScrEv_choose_tree
what 
kinds 
of 
trees 
grow RelNScrEv_tree
best 
in 
my 
area 
. 
i 
decided ScrEv_choose_tree
on 
a 
nice 
pine 
tree 
and 
headed ScrEv_other_tree
to 
the 
nursery 
. 
i 
took UnrelEv_tree
a 
little 
time 
looking ScrEv_choose_tree
at 
their 
pine 
trees 
until 
i 
found ScrEv_choose_tree
the 
one 
i 
liked UnrelEv_tree
. 
i 
bought ScrEv_get_tree
it 
and 
some 
topsoil 
to 
plant RelNScrEv_tree
it 
in 
and 
got UnrelEv_tree
them 
loaded RelNScrEv_tree
into 
my 
car 
. 
once 
i 
was UnrelEv_tree
home 
, 
i 
grabbed ScrEv_get_tools
my 
shovel 
and 
went+out UnrelEv_tree
to 
the 
place 
i 
wanted 
to 
put RelNScrEv_tree
the 
tree 
. 
i 
started UnrelEv_tree
digging ScrEv_dig_hole
and 
kept+at UnrelEv_tree
it 
until 
i 
had UnrelEv_tree
a 
hole 
deep 
and 
wide 
enough 
to 
fit RelNScrEv_tree
the 
little 
tree 
in 
. 
i 
put ScrEv_place_root
it 
in 
the 
hole 
and 
filled ScrEv_refill_hole
around 
it 
with 
the 
nice 
topsoil 
i 
bought ScrEv_get_tools
so 
i 
had UnrelEv_tree
good 
dirt 
to 
start UnrelEv_tree
growing RelNScrEv_tree
in 
. 
i 
spread+out ScrEv_tamp_dirt
the 
dirt 
i 
had 
taken RelNScrEv_tree
out 
of 
the 
hole 
so 
i 
did 
n't 
have UnrelEv_tree
a 
pile 
of 
dirt 
, 
then 
watered ScrEv_water
the 
tree 
and 
put ScrEv_other_tree
my 
tools 
away 
. 
i 
knwo UnrelEv_tree
it 
will 
take UnrelEv_tree
years 
, 
but 
that 
tree 
is 
going 
to 
look UnrelEv_tree
great 
once 
it 
; 
s 
bigger 
. 
<end_of_story>_tree 
springtime 
is UnrelEv_tree
upon 
us 
and 
there 
's UnrelEv_tree
no 
better 
time 
to 
get UnrelEv_tree
outdoors 
and 
work UnrelEv_tree
on 
landscaping RelNScrEv_tree

have ScrEv_find_place
a 
safe 
spot 
, 
dig ScrEv_dig_hole
a

<end_of_story>_tree 
on 
arbor 
day 
this 
year 
, 
i 
decided UnrelEv_tree
to 
plant+a+new+tree Evoking_tree
in 
my 
front 
yard 
. 
i 
went+out UnrelEv_tree
and 
dug ScrEv_dig_hole
a 
hole 
where ScrEv_find_place
i 
decided ScrEv_find_place
the 
tree 
would 
go RelNScrEv_tree
, 
and 
i 
kept RelNScrEv_tree
the 
dirt 
i 
dug+up ScrEv_dig_hole
off 
to 
the 
side 
for 
easy 
access 
to 
replant RelNScrEv_tree
with 
. 
i 
got UnrelEv_tree
in 
my 
car 
and 
drove UnrelEv_tree
to 
the 
local 
nursery 
to 
look+at ScrEv_choose_tree
trees 
. 
i 
had UnrelEv_tree
an 
idea 
of 
what 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_tree
in 
mind 
, 
but 
they 
had UnrelEv_tree
so 
many 
different 
trees 
when 
i 
got UnrelEv_tree
there 
that 
i 
had UnrelEv_tree
a 
very 
hard 
time 
deciding ScrEv_choose_tree
. 
finally 
, 
i 
just 
decided ScrEv_choose_tree
to 
go+with UnrelEv_tree
the 
tree 
i 
had 
originally 
planned UnrelEv_tree
to 
purchase ScrEv_get_tree
. 
i 
went UnrelEv_tree
to 
the 
cashier 
and 
paid ScrEv_get_tree
for 
the 
tree 
and 
loaded ScrEv_other_tree
it 
in 
my 
truck 
to 
drive UnrelEv_tree
home 
. 
once 
i 
got UnrelEv_tree
home 
, 
i 
brought ScrEv_other_tree
the 
tree 
out 
to 
the 
spot 
in 
my 
yard 
where 
i 
had 
dug ScrEv_dig_hole
the 
hole 
. 
i 
unwrapped ScrEv_unwrap_root
the 
bottom 
of 
the 
tree 
that 
had 
been 
wrapped+up RelNScrEv_tree
to 
prevent UnrelEv_tree
a 
mess 
, 
and 
i 
placed ScrEv_find_place
it 
in 
the 
dirt 
. 
i 
packed ScrEv_refill_hole
the 
dirt 
i 
had 
dug+up ScrEv_dig_hole
around 
the 
bottom 
of 
the 
tree 
to 
keep UnrelEv_tree
it 
secure 
, 
and 
i 
watered ScrEv_water
it 
and 
tied ScrEv_tie_stakes_up
some 
stakes 
up 
to 
keep UnrelEv_tree
the 
tree 
level 
and 
upright 
. 
that 
's 
how 
i 
planted+a+tree Evoking_tree
. 
<end_of_story>_tree 
planting+a+tree Evoking_tree
is UnrelEv_tree
a 
wonderful 
thing 
you 
can 
do UnrelEv_tree
for 
your 
community 
and 
your 
environment 
. 
trees 
provide UnrelEv_tree
with 
life 
sustaining 
oxygen 
. 
they 
are UnrelEv_tree
also 
beautiful 
and 
we 
need UnrelEv_tree
them 
from 
, 
something 
to 
build UnrelEv_tree
a 
fort 
in 
, 
to 
wood 
to 
build UnrelEv_tree
our 
homes 
. 
plant+a+tree Evoking_tree
by 
selecting ScrEv_find_place
the 
species 
you 
think UnrelEv_tree
would 
be UnrelEv_tree
best 
suited UnrelEv_tree
for 
the 
location 
and 
soil 
that 
you 
have UnrelEv_tree
. 
you 
then 
dig ScrEv_dig_hole
a 
hole 
that 
will 
keep UnrelEv_tree
the 
top 
of 
the 
rootball 
just 
slightly 
below 
ground 
level 
and 
the 
base 
of 
the 
tree 
just 
so 
it 
can 
have 
a 
shallow 
circle 
made UnrelEv_tree
around 
it 
. 
fill+in ScrEv_refill_hole
some 
fresh 
soil 
or 
even 
compost 
made UnrelEv_tree
from 
old 
rotting 
leaves 
and 
grass 
clippings 
. 
this 
will 
help UnrelEv_tree
fertilize ScrEv_place_fertilizers
the 
tree 
and 
if 
you 
want UnrelEv_tree
you 
can 
add ScrEv_place_fertilizers
some 
fertilizer 
. 
cover ScrEv_refill_hole
it 
up 
and 
make UnrelEv_tree
a 
small 
ring 
around 
the 
base 
of 
the 
tree 
to 
help UnrelEv_tree
catch RelNScrEv_tree
water 
. 
then 
water ScrEv_water
the 
tree 
for 
a 
good 
long 
time 
so 
the 
roots 
will 
grow RelNScrEv_tree
deep 
. 
<end_of_story>_tree 
the 
only 
time 
i 
have 
ever 
planted+a+tree Evoking_tree
was 
as 
a 
memorial 
. 
we 
had 
raised UnrelEv_tree
the 
funds 
to 
buy ScrEv_get_tree
the 
tree 
. 
then 
i 
went ScrEv_other_tree
to 
home 
depot 
to 
pick ScrEv_choose_tree
out 
the 
tree 
. 
i 
know UnrelEv_tree
nothing 
about 
trees 
, 
so 
i 
had UnrelEv_tree
the 
employee 
at 
home 
depot 
help RelNScrEv_tree
me 
. 
she 
helped RelNScrEv_tree
me 
decide ScrEv_choose_tree
the 
best 
tree 
for 
the 
area 
that 
we 
were 
planting Evoking_tree
it 
. 
one 
that 
would 
n't 
need UnrelEv_tree
much 
work 
or 
upkeep 
. 
then 
she 
showed RelNScrEv_tree
me 
what 
else 
i 
would 
need RelNScrEv_tree
for 
the 
tree 
. 
i 
bought ScrEv_get_tools
soil 
and 
a 
shovel 
. 
we 
went ScrEv_take_home
to 
the 
park 
where 
we 
were 
planting+the+tree Evoking_tree
and 
dug ScrEv_dig_hole
the 
hole 
for 
the 
tree 
. 
after 
we 
place ScrEv_place_root
the 
tree 
and 
put+in ScrEv_place_fertilizers
the 
supports 
, 
we 
filled ScrEv_refill_hole
the 
hole 
back 
in 
, 
packing ScrEv_tamp_dirt
the 
soil 
tight 
. 
we 
said UnrelEv_tree
a 
few 
words 
and 
watered ScrEv_water
the 
tree 
. 
lastly 
, 
we 
put UnrelEv_tree
the 
memorial 
plaque 
in 
front 
of 
the 
tree 
since 
it 
was UnrelEv_tree
a 
memorial 
for 
someone 
who 
has 
passed UnrelEv_tree
. 
<end_of_story>_tree 
yesterday 
i 
went ScrEv_other_tree
to 
the 
nursery 
and 
bought ScrEv_get_tree
a 
baby 
apple 
tree 
about 
three 
feet 
tall 
. 
i 
've 
always 
loved UnrelEv_tree
apple 
trees 
. 
i 
carried ScrEv_take_home
it 
home 
in 
my 
pickup 
truck 
. 
i 
grabbed ScrEv_get_tools
my 
shovel 
from 
the 
shed 
and 
started UnrelEv_tree
to 
dig ScrEv_dig_hole
a 
hole 
out 
in 
the 
corner 
of 
my 
backyard 
. 
as 
i 
was 
shoveling ScrEv_dig_hole
i 
started UnrelEv_tree
to 
hit RelNScrEv_tree
some 
rocky 
soil 
, 
and 
i 
decided UnrelEv_tree
to 
try UnrelEv_tree
the 
other 
far 
back 
corner 
of 
my 
yard 
. 
the 
hole 
took RelNScrEv_tree
about 
523 
minutes 
to 
dig ScrEv_dig_hole
, 
and 
i 
was+exhausted UnrelEv_tree
from 
the 
work 
and 
the 
heat 
. 
i 
was 
able 
to 
fit ScrEv_place_root
the 
tree 
perfectly 
into 
the 
hole 
and 
then 
took ScrEv_other_tree
a 
break 
to 
drink UnrelEv_tree
some 
lemonade 
. 
after 
about 
523 
minutes 
i 
started UnrelEv_tree
to 
refill ScrEv_refill_hole
the 
dirt 
around 
the 
tree 
. 
after 
packing ScrEv_tamp_dirt
the 
dirt 
down 
, 
i 
saturated ScrEv_water
the 
ground 
around 
the 
tree 
with 
water 
. 
i 
hope UnrelEv_tree
that 
the 
tree 
is UnrelEv_tree
n't 
too 
shocked UnrelEv_tree
and 
it 
actually 
lives UnrelEv_tree
. 
<end_of_story>_tree 
yesterday 
during 
the 
day 
i 
decided UnrelEv_tree
to 
plant+a+tree Evoking_tree
with 
my 
friend 
bob 
. 
the 
first 
thing 
that 
we 
did UnrelEv_tree
was 
go UnrelEv_tree
and 
buy ScrEv_get_tree
a 
little 
tree 
from 
the 
local 
walmart 
. 
we 
then 
went ScrEv_take_home
into 
my 
backyard 
and 
begun UnrelEv_tree
to 
did ScrEv_dig_hole
a 
hole 
. 
we 
got ScrEv_dig_hole
the 
hole 
to 
about 
halfway 
the 
size 
we 
wanted UnrelEv_tree
it 
and 
decided UnrelEv_tree
to 
take+a RelNScrEv_tree
break 
for 
lemonade 
. 
next 
we 
continued 
digging ScrEv_dig_hole
, 
all 
the 
while 
i 
am 
contemplating UnrelEv_tree
the 
small 
part 
in 
ensuring UnrelEv_tree
an 
eco 
friendly 
future 
. 
as 
the 
sweat 
pours UnrelEv_tree
down 
my 
face 
we 
finish ScrEv_dig_hole
the 
hole 
. 
me 
and 
bob 
gently 
place ScrEv_place_root
the 
small 
tree 
in 
the 
hole 
. 
now 
we 
prepared UnrelEv_tree
for 
the 
truly 
fun 
part 
. 
putting ScrEv_refill_hole
back 
into 
the 
ground 
all 
the 
dirt 
that 
we 
had 
just 
put RelNScrEv_tree
there 
. 
we 
filled ScrEv_refill_hole
the 
hole 
and 
then 
watered ScrEv_water
my 
new 
plant 
. 
after 
we 
finished UnrelEv_tree
me 
and 
bob 
sat+back UnrelEv_tree
with 
a 
beer 
overlooking UnrelEv_tree
this 
new 
tree 
that 
we 
had 
planted RelNScrEv_tree
. 
<end_of_story>_tree 
last 
spring 
, 
i 
planted+a+tree Evoking_tree
in 
my 
backyard 
. 
when 
i 
was UnrelEv_tree
a 
kid 
, 
we 
always 
had UnrelEv_tree
apples 
, 
because 
we 
had UnrelEv_tree
two 
apple 
trees 
in 
our 
backyard 
. 
we 
used 
to 
make UnrelEv_tree
pies 
and 
applesauce 
and 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_tree
to 
have UnrelEv_tree
that 
at 
my 
house 
. 
i 
went ScrEv_get_tree
to 
the 
local 
nursery 
and 
i 
found ScrEv_choose_tree
a 
523 
foot 
tree 
. 
with 
delivery 
, 
it 
was RelNScrEv_tree
pretty 
expensive 
, 
but 
i 
figured UnrelEv_tree
it 
was UnrelEv_tree
worth 
it 
. 
i 
dug+out ScrEv_dig_hole
an 
area 
in 
my 
backyard 
. 
i 
was 
surprised UnrelEv_tree
at 
how 
long 
it 
took UnrelEv_tree
and 
how 
much 
dirt 
that 
i 
had 
to 
move ScrEv_dig_hole
. 
digging ScrEv_dig_hole
the 
hole 
took UnrelEv_tree
me 
the 
longest 
time 
of 
the 
whole 
process 
. 
i 
finally 
got 
that 
done UnrelEv_tree
and 
i 
stuck ScrEv_place_root
the 
tree 
in 
the 
ground 
. 
i 
read RelNScrEv_tree
online 
about 
a 
fertilizer 
that 
was UnrelEv_tree
good 
for 
apple 
trees 
and 
mixed ScrEv_place_fertilizers
that 
in 
with 
the 
dirt 
as 
i 
was 
filling ScrEv_place_fertilizers
in 
the 
area 
around 
the 
roots 
. 
i 
do 
n't 
expect UnrelEv_tree
to 
get RelNScrEv_tree
any 
apples 
this 
year 
and 
probably 
not 
next 
year 
, 
but 
the 
tree 
should 
be UnrelEv_tree
mature 
enough 
to 
start UnrelEv_tree
producing RelNScrEv_tree
apples 
in 
the 
following UnrelEv_tree
years 
. 
the 
whole 
process 
took UnrelEv_tree
me 
about 
523 
hours 
to 
get+the+tree+planted Evoking_tree
. 
i 
wish UnrelEv_tree
i 
would 
have 
paid UnrelEv_tree
someone 
to 
do Unclear_tree
it 
for 
me 
. 
<end_of_story>_tree 
i 
went UnrelEv_tree
to 
my 
grandmother 
's 
house 
this 
summer 
and 
she 
loves UnrelEv_tree
to 
garden RelNScrEv_tree
. 
she 
asked UnrelEv_tree
me 
to 
help UnrelEv_tree
her 
plan+a+lemon+tree Evoking_tree
in 
her 
front 
yard 
. 
since 
my 
grandmother 
was UnrelEv_tree
elderly 
and 
did 
n't 
have UnrelEv_tree
enough 
strength 
to 
shovel ScrEv_dig_hole
i 
did Unclear_tree
it 
instead 
. 
i 
dug ScrEv_dig_hole
a 
hole 
big 
enough 
from 
the 
tree 
. 
my 
grandmother 
had 
gone+out ScrEv_get_tools
to 
our 
local 
garden 
center 
and 
picked+out ScrEv_get_tree
a 
young 
lemon 
tree 
from 
their 
nursery 
. 
i 
grabbed ScrEv_unwrap_root
the 
lemon 
tree 
from 
the 
pot 
and 
placed ScrEv_place_root
the 
bottom 
of 
the 
tree 
into 
the 
hole 
. 
i 
cover ScrEv_refill_hole
the 
roots 
and 
the 
hole 
with 
soil 
until 
it 
was 
all 
covered+up ScrEv_refill_hole
. 
my 
grandmother 
sprinkled ScrEv_place_fertilizers
fertilizer 
and 
other 
plant 
nutrients 
into 
the 
soil 
. 
while 
she 
was 
doing Unclear_tree
that 
i 
grabbed ScrEv_get_tools
the 
hose 
and 
turned ScrEv_water
the 
water 
on 
. 
i 
walked RelNScrEv_tree
towards 
the 
lemon 
tree 
and 
sprinkled ScrEv_water
water 
into 
the 
soil 
. 
hopefully 
the 
next 
time 
my 
grandmother 
and 
i 
meet UnrelEv_tree
to 
get 
to 
make UnrelEv_tree
lemonade 
. 
<end_of_story>_tree 
last 
weekend 
i 
thought UnrelEv_tree
it 
would 
be UnrelEv_tree
neat 
to 
make UnrelEv_tree
my 
back 
yard 
more 
lively 
. 
i 
went ScrEv_get_tree
to 
the 
local 
landscaping 
store 
and 
picked+out ScrEv_choose_tree
some 
trees 
i 
thought UnrelEv_tree
would 
look UnrelEv_tree
nice 
in 
my 
yard 
. 
after 
returning UnrelEv_tree
home 
i 
called UnrelEv_tree
to 
my 
kids 
to 
come UnrelEv_tree
help RelNScrEv_tree
me 
install+the+new+plants Evoking_tree
. 
we 
all 
grabbed ScrEv_get_tools
shovels 
, 
gloves 
, 
and 
buckets 
and 
went UnrelEv_tree
to 
work 
. 
we 
dug ScrEv_dig_hole
holes 
around 
the 
yard 
where 
we 
thought UnrelEv_tree
it 
would 
be UnrelEv_tree
nice 
to 
have 
the 
trees 
grow RelNScrEv_tree
. 
we 
carefully 
each 
picked ScrEv_choose_tree
our 
favorite 
tree 
for 
each 
spot 
. 
once 
we 
had 
settled ScrEv_find_place
on 
the 
location 
of 
each 
tree 
we 
set ScrEv_place_root
them 
in 
the 
holes 
and 
covered ScrEv_refill_hole
them 
back 
up 
with 
dirt 
. 
after 
placing ScrEv_place_fertilizers
some 
mulch 
around 
each 
tree 
to 
hold RelNScrEv_tree
moisture 
it 
was 
time 
to 
water ScrEv_water
the 
plants 
. 
we 
were 
all 
pretty 
worn+out UnrelEv_tree
by 
this 
time 
so 
we 
played UnrelEv_tree
rock 
, 
paper 
, 
scissors 
to 
determine UnrelEv_tree
who 
would 
have 
to 
get ScrEv_get_tools
the 
hose 
and 
water ScrEv_water
the 
new 
trees 
. 
i 
ended+up+losing UnrelEv_tree
the 
game 
and 
was 
assigned UnrelEv_tree
the 
task 
of 
watering ScrEv_water
. 
<end_of_story>_tree 
i 
had 
never 
planted+a+tree Evoking_tree
before 
, 
so 
before 
we 
planted Evoking_tree
one 
, 
i 
had 
to 
do UnrelEv_tree
a 
lot 
of 
research 
. 
i 
had 
to 
look+up ScrEv_choose_tree
what 
kind 
of 
tree 
would 
work UnrelEv_tree
best 
in 
my 
climate 
. 
i 
had 
to 
see UnrelEv_tree
which 
ones 
needed RelNScrEv_tree
certain 
levels 
of 
care 
, 
look+up ScrEv_choose_tree
different 
tree 
diseases 
, 
and 
the 
prices 
of 
some 
trees 
. 
i 
had 
to 
find ScrEv_choose_tree
something 
that 
would 
work UnrelEv_tree
well 
in 
my 
yard 
. 
when 
we 
finally 
picked ScrEv_choose_tree
a 
perfect 
tree 
, 
we 
had 
to 
take ScrEv_take_home
it 
home 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_tree
very 
heavy 
! 
once 
we 
had ScrEv_get_tree
it 
home 
, 
we 
had 
to 
dig ScrEv_dig_hole
a 
very 
big 
hole 
. 
after 
you 
roll ScrEv_place_root
the 
tree 
into 
the 
hole 
, 
you 
have 
to 
do UnrelEv_tree
something 
called UnrelEv_tree
facing RelNScrEv_tree
the 
tree 
, 
which 
means UnrelEv_tree
you 
put ScrEv_other_tree
the 
tree 
in 
the 
position 
you 
are UnrelEv_tree
happy 
with 
the 
already 
existing UnrelEv_tree
branches 
growing RelNScrEv_tree
. 
you 
do 
n't 
want UnrelEv_tree
a 
huge 
branch 
going RelNScrEv_tree
right 
toward 
your 
house 
! 
to 
make 
facing RelNScrEv_tree
easier 
, 
you 
should 
fill ScrEv_water
the 
hole 
halfway 
with 
water 
before 
putting ScrEv_place_root
the 
tree 
inside 
. 
after 
you 
face RelNScrEv_tree
the 
tree 
, 
fill+in ScrEv_refill_hole
the 
dirt 
, 
and 
pat UnrelEv_tree
yourself 
on 
the 
back 
for 
a 
job 
well 
done UnrelEv_tree
. 
<end_of_story>_tree 
last 
year 
, 
i 
was UnrelEv_tree
outside 
working RelNScrEv_tree
in 
the 
garden 
when 
i 
realized UnrelEv_tree
that 
my 
front 
yard 
would 
like UnrelEv_tree
much 
nicer 
if 
i 
planted+a+tree Evoking_tree
to 
provide RelNScrEv_tree
it 
with 
a 
little 
shade 
. 
i 
went ScrEv_get_tree
to 
the 
gardeners 
store 
down 
the 
street 
and 
pick+up ScrEv_get_tree
some 
seeds 
to 
plant+my+tree Evoking_tree
. 
i 
decided UnrelEv_tree
on 
a 
maple 
tree 
as 
that 
would 
look UnrelEv_tree
nice 
and 
make RelNScrEv_tree
a 
perfect 
amount 
of 
shade 
for 
my 
front 
lawn 
. 
i 
dug ScrEv_dig_hole
a 
small 
hole 
where 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_tree
to 
plant+the+tree Evoking_tree
and 
put ScrEv_other_tree
the 
seeds 
in 
place 
. 
every 
few 
weeks 
i 
noticed UnrelEv_tree
that 
the 
tree 
started UnrelEv_tree
to 
grow RelNScrEv_tree
more 
and 
more 
as 
i 
provided ScrEv_place_fertilizers
it 
with 
the 
correct 
amount 
of 
water 
and 
nutrients 
. 
after 
about 
523 
months 
the 
tree 
i 
had 
planted Evoking_tree
was 
nearly 
fully 
grown RelNScrEv_tree
and 
looked UnrelEv_tree
wonderful 
next 
to 
me 
garden 
. 
i 
was 
very 
satisfied UnrelEv_tree
with 
the 
entire 
situation 
and 
love UnrelEv_tree
the 
idea 
of 
plants 
growing RelNScrEv_tree
from 
the 
ground 
. 
<end_of_story>_tree 
last 
year 
i 
planted+a+fig+tree Evoking_tree
with 
my 
grandfather 
. 
ordinarily 
we 
would 
n't 
have 
to 
plant Evoking_tree
a 
tree 
, 
but 
his 
old 
tree 
had 
died RelNScrEv_tree
over 
the 
winter 
. 
we 
live UnrelEv_tree
in 
kind 
of 
a 
cold 
climate 
so 
fig 
trees 
really 
do 
n't 
grow RelNScrEv_tree
well 
here 
, 
and 
if 
they 
do Unclear_tree
you 
usually 
wo 
n't 
get RelNScrEv_tree
figs 
. 
they 
're 
more 
often 
used RelNScrEv_tree
as 
ornamental 
plants 
around 
here 
, 
but 
the 
trees 
my 
grandfather 
has UnrelEv_tree
always 
produce RelNScrEv_tree
figs 
. 
after 
we 
got+rid RelNScrEv_tree
of 
the 
old 
tree 
, 
we 
planted Evoking_tree
the 
new 
one 
near 
where 
the 
old 
one 
had 
been UnrelEv_tree
. 
the 
important 
thing 
about 
growing RelNScrEv_tree
these 
kinds 
of 
trees 
in 
this 
area 
is 
getting 
them 
to 
survive RelNScrEv_tree
the 
winter 
. 
what 
we 
did 
was 
we 
got ScrEv_get_tools
a 
bunch 
of 
maple 
leaves 
and 
some 
chicken 
wire 
fencing 
. 
we 
wrapped ScrEv_other_tree
the 
chicken 
wire 
around 
the 
tree 
and 
stuffed ScrEv_other_tree
the 
space 
between 
with 
the 
leaves 
. 
then 
we 
wrapped ScrEv_other_tree
the 
whole 
thing 
with 
an 
insulated UnrelEv_tree
landscaping 
tarp 
. 
we 
will 
know UnrelEv_tree
in 
a 
couple 
of 
weeks 
if 
the 
new 
tree 
survived RelNScrEv_tree
the 
winter 
. 
<end_of_story>_tree 
i 
went+out Unclear_tree
to 
my 
backyard 
with 
the 
appropriate 
tools 
needed RelNScrEv_tree
to 
plant Evoking_tree
my 
tree 
. 
i 
was 
planning ScrEv_choose_tree
on 
planting Evoking_tree
an 
orange 
tree 
as 
i 
could 
harvest RelNScrEv_tree
the 
oranges 
once 
they 
become RelNScrEv_tree
ripe 
. 
i 
started UnrelEv_tree
digging ScrEv_dig_hole
into 
the 
soil 
where 
my 
old 
tree 
used 
to 
be UnrelEv_tree
-lrb- 
but 
was 
unfortunately 
torn+down RelNScrEv_tree
as 
a 
result 
of 
old 
age 
and 
danger 
of 
power 
lines 
, 
but 
i 
got ScrEv_other_tree
the 
clear 
to 
plant Evoking_tree
another 
tree 
if 
i 
had 
wished UnrelEv_tree
-rrb- 
. 
i 
then 
planted Evoking_tree
my 
several 
orange 
tree 
seeds 
into 
the 
ground 
, 
and 
started UnrelEv_tree
covering ScrEv_refill_hole
them 
with 
dirt 
again 
. 
i 
tilled ScrEv_tamp_dirt
the 
dirt 
over 
and 
around 
the 
planted Evoking_tree
seeds 
to 
smooth+out ScrEv_tamp_dirt
the 
surface 
. 
i 
then 
took ScrEv_get_tools
my 
garden 
hose 
and 
watered ScrEv_water
the 
area 
for 
about 
ten 
to 
fifteen 
minutes 
. 
once 
i 
was 
done UnrelEv_tree
with 
watering ScrEv_water
, 
i 
made UnrelEv_tree
sure 
the 
seeds 
did 
not 
get 
flooded RelNScrEv_tree
to 
the 
surface 
of 
the 
soil 
as 
a 
result 
of 
my 
watering ScrEv_water
, 
to 
which 
i 
noticed UnrelEv_tree
they 
had 
been 
finely 
secured RelNScrEv_tree
underground 
. 
i 
put ScrEv_other_tree
my 
materials 
away 
and 
went+back UnrelEv_tree
into 
my 
house 
. 
<end_of_story>_tree 
i 
found ScrEv_get_tree
a 
beautiful 
little 
tree 
at 
the 
local 
nursery 
and 
brought ScrEv_get_tree
it 
home 
to 
plant Evoking_tree
in 
my 
garden 
. 
i 
had 
already 
picked ScrEv_find_place
the 
spot 
it 
was 
to 
go ScrEv_find_place
, 
a 
place 
in 
the 
middle 
of 
my 
yard 
where 
it 
could 
get RelNScrEv_tree
full 
sun 
. 
after 
gathering ScrEv_get_tools
the 
shovel 
and 
watering 
hose 
, 
and 
putting+on ScrEv_get_tools
my 
gardening 
gloves 
, 
i 
set 
to 
work ScrEv_dig_hole
on 
digging ScrEv_dig_hole
the 
hole 
. 
i 
had 
to 
make UnrelEv_tree
sure 
the 
hole 
was UnrelEv_tree
deep 
enough 
to 
fit ScrEv_place_root
its 
roots 
comfortably 
. 
i 
dampened ScrEv_water
the 
soil 
in 
the 
hole 
with 
a 
little 
water 
. 
once 
the 
hole 
was UnrelEv_tree
ready 
, 
i 
laid RelNScrEv_tree
the 
tree 
on 
its 
side 
and 
gently 
removed ScrEv_unwrap_root
the 
pot 
from 
it 
. 
i 
placed ScrEv_place_root
the 
sapling 
into 
the 
hole 
and 
looked UnrelEv_tree
to 
see UnrelEv_tree
that 
the 
base 
of 
its 
trunk 
would 
be 
level RelNScrEv_tree
with 
the 
ground 
, 
then 
began UnrelEv_tree
scraping ScrEv_refill_hole
the 
soil 
back 
into 
the 
hole 
, 
over 
the 
roots 
. 
i 
tamped ScrEv_tamp_dirt
the 
soil 
down 
, 
so 
as 
to 
prevent RelNScrEv_tree
any 
air 
pockets 
, 
and 
watered ScrEv_water
it 
once 
more 
. 
i 
think UnrelEv_tree
this 
little 
tree 
will 
make UnrelEv_tree
a 
wonderful 
addition 
to 
my 
yard 
! 
<end_of_story>_tree 
last 
year 
when 
i 
worked UnrelEv_tree
for 
a 
friend 
doing UnrelEv_tree
landscaping 
jobs 
, 
we 
often 
had 
to 
plant+trees Evoking_tree
. 
generally 
, 
we 
would 
choose ScrEv_choose_tree
a 
tree 
from 
a 
near 
by 
plant 
store 
based UnrelEv_tree
on 
what 
our 
customer 
desired UnrelEv_tree
. 
trees 
can 
be 
purchased ScrEv_get_tree
at 
all 
different 
ages 
, 
from 
very 
small 
to 
the 
size 
of 
a 
large 
pot 
. 
then 
, 
after 
buying ScrEv_get_tree
the 
tree 
or 
trees 
, 
we 
would 
purchase ScrEv_other_tree
mulch 
, 
or 
fertilizer 
, 
to 
give ScrEv_place_fertilizers
the 
tree 
the 
proper 
nutrients 
so 
it 
can 
grow RelNScrEv_tree
big 
and 
strong 
. 
after 
the 
tree 
and 
fertilizer 
is 
purchased ScrEv_get_tree
, 
we 
were UnrelEv_tree
off 
the 
house 
to 
perform UnrelEv_tree
our 
various 
activities 
. 
we 
lived UnrelEv_tree
in 
a 
desert 
environment 
, 
so 
we 
first 
had 
to 
push ScrEv_other_tree
all 
the 
rocks 
out 
of 
the 
way 
with 
either 
a 
rake 
, 
a 
hoe 
, 
or 
one 
of 
our 
other 
tools 
. 
after 
clearing ScrEv_other_tree
the 
area 
in 
the 
yard 
for 
the 
tree 
, 
we 
then 
took ScrEv_get_tools
our 
shovels 
and 
started UnrelEv_tree
digging+away ScrEv_dig_hole
in 
the 
area 
chosen ScrEv_find_place
to 
plant+the+tree Evoking_tree
. 
we 
had 
to 
dig ScrEv_dig_hole
our 
hole 
big 
enough 
so 
that 
the 
entire 
bottom 
of 
the 
tree 
with 
roots 
and 
dirt 
fits RelNScrEv_tree
snugly 
into 
the 
ground 
. 
after 
that 
is 
done UnrelEv_tree
, 
we 
would 
fill ScrEv_place_fertilizers
the 
hole 
with 
a 
mixture 
of 
mulch 
and 
the 
dirt 
we 
pulled+up ScrEv_get_tools
when 
we 
first 
shoveled ScrEv_dig_hole
our 
hole 
open 
. 
after 
the 
tree 
has 
been 
firmly 
planted ScrEv_place_root
, 
we 
either 
had 
to 
turn+on ScrEv_water
the 
sprinklers 
in 
the 
lawn 
, 
or 
find ScrEv_get_tools
the 
nearest 
hose 
and 
water ScrEv_water
the 
plants 
for 
about 
five 
to 
ten 
minutes 
. 
<end_of_story>_tree 
this 
winter 
, 
my 
family 
and 
i 
decided UnrelEv_tree
we 
wanted UnrelEv_tree
to 
plant+a+tree Evoking_tree
in 
our 
backyard 
. 
since 
it 
was UnrelEv_tree
still 
the 
middle 
of 
winter 
, 
we 
decided UnrelEv_tree
to 
wait UnrelEv_tree
until 
it 
was UnrelEv_tree
april 
to 
plant Evoking_tree
it 
because 
we 
learned UnrelEv_tree
that 
was UnrelEv_tree
the 
best 
time 
of 
year 
to 
do Unclear_tree
it 
. 
once 
april 
came+around UnrelEv_tree
, 
we 
chose ScrEv_choose_tree
a 
suitable 
tree 
for 
our 
area 
. 
with 
a 
shovel 
, 
we 
dug ScrEv_dig_hole
a 
hole 
that 
had UnrelEv_tree
enough 
room 
for 
the 
fresh 
roots 
to 
grow RelNScrEv_tree
. 
after 
that 
was 
done Unclear_tree
, 
we 
prepared ScrEv_get_tree
the 
tree 
by 
gently 
taking ScrEv_get_tree
it 
out 
of 
the 
pot 
. 
once 
our 
tree 
was UnrelEv_tree
ready 
, 
we 
placed ScrEv_place_root
it 
into 
our 
freshly 
dug ScrEv_dig_hole
hole 
. 
once 
the 
tree 
was 
properly 
placed ScrEv_place_root
, 
we 
refilled ScrEv_refill_hole
the 
hole 
with 
the 
dirt 
and 
soil 
so 
that 
it 
was RelNScrEv_tree
securely 
in 
place 
. 
we 
were UnrelEv_tree
happy 
to 
see UnrelEv_tree
our 
tree 
all 
set RelNScrEv_tree
and 
watered ScrEv_water
the 
tree 
. 
we 
plan UnrelEv_tree
to 
enjoy+watching UnrelEv_tree
the 
tree 
grow RelNScrEv_tree
for 
many 
years 
.

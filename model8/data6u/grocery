yesterday 
i 
went+grocery+shopping Evoking_grocery
. 
i 
took ScrEv_take_bags
my 
grocery 
list 
with 
me 
, 
along 
with 
some 
reusable 
shopping 
bags 
. 
my 
grocery 
list 
has UnrelEv_grocery
all 
the 
items 
i 
want 
to 
buy ScrEv_get_groceries
on 
it 
. 
i 
selected ScrEv_take_shop_cart
a 
shopping 
cart 
from 
in 
front 
of 
the 
store 
, 
and 
went+inside ScrEv_enter
. 
i 
put RelNScrEv_grocery
my 
reusable 
bags 
in 
the 
cart 
. 
i 
looked ScrEv_check_list
at 
my 
list 
and 
started UnrelEv_grocery
in 
the 
produce 
section 
. 
i 
put ScrEv_get_groceries
different 
vegetables 
and 
fruits 
into 
my 
cart 
. 
next 
i 
wheeled ScrEv_move_section
my 
cart 
to 
the 
cereal 
aisle 
and 
took ScrEv_get_groceries
a 
box 
of 
cereal 
. 
i 
went ScrEv_move_section
through 
the 
store 
aisle 
by 
aisle 
and 
selected ScrEv_get_groceries
my 
groceries 
. 
each 
aisle 
is 
organized UnrelEv_grocery
by 
types 
of 
food 
and 
non-food 
items 
. 
one 
aisle 
has UnrelEv_grocery
dried 
pasta 
, 
canned 
tomatoes 
, 
rice 
, 
and 
sauce 
. 
i 
selected ScrEv_get_groceries
a 
few 
boxes 
of 
pasta 
and 
some 
rice 
. 
another 
aisle 
carries UnrelEv_grocery
plastic 
wrap 
, 
trash 
bags 
, 
and 
aluminum 
foil 
. 
as 
i 
went ScrEv_move_section
through 
the 
store 
, 
i 
kept 
looking ScrEv_check_list
at 
my 
list 
to 
see 
what 
i 
needed UnrelEv_grocery
next 
. 
when 
i 
added ScrEv_get_groceries
each 
item 
to 
my 
cart 
, 
i 
crossed ScrEv_check_off
it 
off 
my 
list 
. 
my 
last 
stop 
was UnrelEv_grocery
the 
dairy 
aisle 
where 
i 
got ScrEv_get_groceries
milk 
and 
eggs 
. 
when 
i 
had UnrelEv_grocery
all 
the 
groceries 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_grocery
, 
i 
went ScrEv_go_checkout
to 
the 
cash 
register 
ans 
stood ScrEv_wait
in 
line 
. 
when 
it 
was UnrelEv_grocery
my 
turn 
, 
i 
put ScrEv_put_conveyor
each 
item 
on 
the 
conveyor 
belt 
and 
the 
cashier 
scanned ScrEv_cashier_scan/weight
each 
one 
. 
a 
bagger 
put ScrEv_pack_groceries
all 
of 
the 
groceries 
into 
my 
reusable 
bags 
. 
i 
paid ScrEv_pay
, 
and 
then 
the 
cashier 
gave ScrEv_get_receipt
me 
a 
receipt 
. 
i 
loaded ScrEv_bring_vehicle
the 
bags 
of 
groceries 
into 
the 
trunk 
of 
my 
car 
and 
drove ScrEv_leave
home 
. 
<end_of_story>_grocery 
we 
were 
running UnrelEv_grocery
out 
of 
milk 
, 
so 
i 
made ScrEv_make_list
a 
list 
of 
other 
groceries 
we 
needed UnrelEv_grocery
and 
drove ScrEv_go_grocery
to 
the 
store 
. 
i 
picked ScrEv_take_shop_cart
out 
a 
cart 
and 
went ScrEv_move_section
down 
the 
produce 
aisle 
first 
, 
picking ScrEv_get_groceries
out 
bananas 
and 
strawberries 
as 
i 
went ScrEv_move_section
. 
lettuce 
, 
carrots 
, 
and 
zucchini 
were UnrelEv_grocery
next 
on 
the 
list 
. 
i 
wanted 
to 
buy ScrEv_get_groceries
ice 
cream 
, 
but 
was UnrelEv_grocery
afraid 
it 
would 
melt UnrelEv_grocery
, 
so 
i 
passed ScrEv_move_section
the 
freezer 
aisle 
and 
went ScrEv_move_section
straight 
for 
the 
bread 
. 
it 
's UnrelEv_grocery
nice 
to 
have UnrelEv_grocery
good 
fresh 
bread 
for 
sandwiches 
, 
is UnrelEv_grocery
n't 
it 
? 
then 
came ScrEv_move_section
the 
cereal 
aisle 
. 
oatmeal 
would 
make UnrelEv_grocery
a 
good 
change 
for 
breakfast 
. 
next 
came ScrEv_move_section
the 
dairy 
section 
: 
yogurt 
, 
cheese 
, 
butter 
and 
eggs 
were UnrelEv_grocery
all 
on 
the 
list 
along 
with 
the 
milk 
that 
brought UnrelEv_grocery
me 
to 
the 
store 
. 
almost 
done 
, 
i 
swung ScrEv_move_section
back 
to 
the 
freezer 
aisle 
to 
grab ScrEv_get_groceries
that 
ice 
cream 
. 
mmm 
, 
they 
had UnrelEv_grocery
pralines 
and 
cream 
, 
yummy 
! 
<end_of_story>_grocery 
upon 
the 
realization 
i 
was UnrelEv_grocery
out 
of 
milk 
and 
had UnrelEv_grocery
nothing 
to 
make UnrelEv_grocery
for 
dinner 
, 
i 
decided UnrelEv_grocery
to 
stop ScrEv_go_grocery
at 
the 
grocery 
store 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_grocery
down 
the 
street 
from 
my 
apartment 
, 
so 
i 
hopped UnrelEv_grocery
into 
my 
car 
and 
was UnrelEv_grocery
there 
within 
minutes 
. 
i 
grabbed ScrEv_take_shop_cart
a 
basket 
and 
headed ScrEv_move_section
to 
the 
back 
right 
corner 
to 
get ScrEv_get_groceries
some 
ground 
beef 
, 
then 
headed ScrEv_move_section
to 
the 
back 
left 
to 
grab ScrEv_get_groceries
some 
milk 
. 
my 
journey 
then 
continued ScrEv_move_section
to 
the 
produce 
department 
where 
i 
snagged ScrEv_get_groceries
some 
broccoli 
and 
onions 
. 
with 
my 
eyes 
fixed UnrelEv_grocery
on 
the 
checkout 
line 
, 
i 
headed ScrEv_go_checkout
in 
that 
direction 
trying 
to 
keep UnrelEv_grocery
my 
eyes 
away 
from 
the 
ice 
cream 
section 
. 
i 
failed UnrelEv_grocery
and 
took ScrEv_get_groceries
some 
chocolate 
ice 
cream 
, 
went ScrEv_go_checkout
to 
check 
out 
. 
the 
line 
was UnrelEv_grocery
long 
, 
my 
eyes 
then 
wandered UnrelEv_grocery
to 
the 
tabloids 
while 
the 
line 
moved ScrEv_wait
forward 
. 
i 
put ScrEv_put_conveyor
my 
products 
onto 
the 
conveyer 
belt 
and 
smiled UnrelEv_grocery
at 
the 
check 
out 
lady 
. 
after 
i 
typed UnrelEv_grocery
in 
my 
phone 
number 
for 
a 
slight 
discount 
, 
i 
swung UnrelEv_grocery
my 
purse 
around 
me 
to 
get RelNScrEv_grocery
my 
wallet 
and 
paid ScrEv_pay
. 
i 
took ScrEv_bring_vehicle
my 
bags 
of 
stuff 
and 
walked ScrEv_bring_vehicle
to 
my 
car 
. 
<end_of_story>_grocery 
before 
i 
go+grocery+shopping Evoking_grocery
i 
make ScrEv_make_list
a 
list 
. 
i 
actually 
keep UnrelEv_grocery
a 
list 
going UnrelEv_grocery
on 
a 
magnetic 
notepad 
on 
the 
fridge 
and 
one 
on 
my 
phone 
whenever 
i 
know UnrelEv_grocery
i 
am UnrelEv_grocery
out 
or 
low 
on 
something 
. 
i 
try 
to 
only 
go Evoking_grocery
once 
a 
week 
unless 
there 
is UnrelEv_grocery
something 
i 
really 
need UnrelEv_grocery
for 
a 
specific 
meal 
. 
i 
take UnrelEv_grocery
my 
electronic 
list 
with 
me 
to 
the 
store 
, 
but 
i 
often 
still 
walk ScrEv_move_section
up 
and 
down 
most 
aisles 
just 
browsing RelNScrEv_grocery
for 
anything 
new 
or 
that 
i 
might 
want 
to 
try UnrelEv_grocery
. 
i 
like 
to 
keep UnrelEv_grocery
a 
rough 
estimate 
of 
how 
much 
i 
am 
buying RelNScrEv_grocery
by 
rounding+up UnrelEv_grocery
. 
so 
if 
a 
can 
of 
soup 
is UnrelEv_grocery
$ 
523 
i 
think 
$ 
523 
and 
keep 
adding UnrelEv_grocery
that 
as 
i 
shop Evoking_grocery
if 
i 
'm 
wanting 
to 
stay UnrelEv_grocery
on 
a 
specific 
budget 
. 
once 
i 
have RelNScrEv_grocery
all 
my 
items 
in 
my 
cart 
i 
go ScrEv_go_checkout
to 
the 
checkout 
line 
that 
seems 
to 
have UnrelEv_grocery
the 
least 
amount 
of 
people 
in 
it 
. 
i 
do 
n't 
like 
to 
jump RelNScrEv_grocery
lines 
if 
one 
line 
seems 
to 
be 
moving RelNScrEv_grocery
faster 
. 
good 
to 
have UnrelEv_grocery
a 
little 
bit 
of 
patience 
. 
i 
try 
to 
remember UnrelEv_grocery
to 
bring ScrEv_take_bags
my 
bags 
with 
me 
so 
that 
i 
'm 
not 
always 
getting RelNScrEv_grocery
plastic 
bags 
. 
<end_of_story>_grocery 
last 
night 
, 
i 
made ScrEv_make_list
a 
grocery 
list 
and 
went+shopping Evoking_grocery
. 
to 
make ScrEv_make_list
a 
list 
, 
i 
go RelNScrEv_grocery
through 
my 
cabinets 
and 
refrigerator 
and 
write+down ScrEv_make_list
things 
that 
i 
am UnrelEv_grocery
out 
of 
. 
these 
are UnrelEv_grocery
always 
the 
same 
things 
like 
coffee 
and 
milk 
. 
then 
i 
thought UnrelEv_grocery
of 
some 
recipes 
i 
wanted 
to 
make UnrelEv_grocery
. 
i 
wrote+down ScrEv_make_list
pasta 
shells 
, 
ricotta 
cheese 
, 
parmesan 
cheese 
, 
spinach 
, 
and 
tomato 
sauce 
. 
i 
am 
going 
to 
make UnrelEv_grocery
stuffed 
shells 
this 
week 
! 
when 
i 
got ScrEv_go_grocery
to 
the 
store 
, 
i 
got ScrEv_take_bags
my 
reusable 
bags 
out 
of 
the 
car 
. 
using UnrelEv_grocery
no 
plastic 
bags 
is UnrelEv_grocery
a 
great 
way 
to 
help UnrelEv_grocery
the 
environment 
. 
since 
i 
went ScrEv_go_grocery
to 
the 
store 
around 
523 
p.m. 
, 
it 
was UnrelEv_grocery
n't 
very 
crowded 
. 
i 
could 
relax UnrelEv_grocery
as 
i 
moved ScrEv_move_section
my 
way 
from 
produce 
, 
dry 
goods 
, 
and 
then 
dairy 
. 
i 
saw RelNScrEv_grocery
a 
huge 
display 
of 
easter 
candy 
because 
it 
is UnrelEv_grocery
march 
and 
the 
holiday 
is 
coming+up UnrelEv_grocery
. 
i 
was UnrelEv_grocery
so 
tempted 
to 
buy ScrEv_get_groceries
a 
lot 
of 
chocolate 
but 
i 
did UnrelEv_grocery
n't 
. 
i 
only 
try 
to 
get ScrEv_get_groceries
treats 
once 
in 
awhile 
. 
finally 
, 
i 
went ScrEv_go_checkout
to 
the 
front 
check 
out 
. 
the 
cashier 
was UnrelEv_grocery
nice 
and 
the 
bagger 
was UnrelEv_grocery
happy 
to 
use ScrEv_pack_groceries
my 
own 
bags 
. 
i 
got ScrEv_leave
home 
and 
put RelNScrEv_grocery
everything 
away 
. 
now 
i 
ca 
n't 
wait UnrelEv_grocery
to 
make UnrelEv_grocery
my 
stuffed 
shells 
for 
dinner 
! 
<end_of_story>_grocery 
i 
like 
to 
go+grocery+shopping Evoking_grocery
and 
went Evoking_grocery
yesterday 
. 
the 
first 
thing 
i 
did UnrelEv_grocery
when 
i 
arrived ScrEv_go_grocery
was 
park RelNScrEv_grocery
closest 
the 
exit 
i 
knew 
i 
'd 
be 
using UnrelEv_grocery
after 
i 
'm 
finished UnrelEv_grocery
. 
then 
i 
went+inside ScrEv_enter
and 
chose ScrEv_take_shop_cart
a 
shopping 
cart 
. 
next 
, 
i 
used RelNScrEv_grocery
the 
wipes 
the 
store 
provides UnrelEv_grocery
at 
the 
entrance 
and 
wipe RelNScrEv_grocery
off 
the 
handle 
of 
the 
shopping 
cart 
, 
and 
my 
hands 
, 
so 
i 
know UnrelEv_grocery
my 
hands 
will 
stay UnrelEv_grocery
clean 
while 
i 
choose ScrEv_get_groceries
my 
food 
. 
then 
i 
took+out ScrEv_check_list
the 
shopping 
list 
i 
wrote ScrEv_make_list
at 
home 
and 
i 
started UnrelEv_grocery
. 
i 
always 
start UnrelEv_grocery
with 
heavy 
things 
like 
cans 
and 
boxes 
so 
i 
can 
put ScrEv_get_groceries
them 
in 
the 
bottom 
of 
my 
cart 
. 
then 
i 
went ScrEv_move_section
to 
the 
cold 
and 
frozen 
foods 
and 
put ScrEv_get_groceries
them 
into 
my 
cart 
next 
. 
after 
that 
, 
i 
chose ScrEv_get_groceries
meat 
and 
fresh 
produce 
as 
well 
as 
things 
like 
bread 
, 
eggs 
and 
chips 
which 
need 
to 
stay UnrelEv_grocery
on 
top 
of 
the 
other 
food 
so 
they 
wo 
n't 
get 
crushed UnrelEv_grocery
. 
when 
i 
had UnrelEv_grocery
everything 
i 
needed UnrelEv_grocery
, 
i 
went ScrEv_go_checkout
to 
the 
check 
out 
line 
that 
seemed UnrelEv_grocery
the 
fastest 
and 
shortest 
. 
then 
i 
unloaded ScrEv_put_conveyor
my 
groceries 
onto 
the 
counter 
so 
the 
check 
out 
clerk 
could 
add ScrEv_cashier_scan/weight
the 
costs 
. 
i 
was 
sure 
to 
keep UnrelEv_grocery
my 
cold 
foods 
together 
so 
the 
clerk 
would 
pack ScrEv_pack_groceries
them 
together 
in 
bags 
and 
keep UnrelEv_grocery
them 
cold 
. 
i 
gave RelNScrEv_grocery
her 
my 
own 
cloth 
bags 
because 
it 
helps UnrelEv_grocery
the 
environment 
by 
not 
using UnrelEv_grocery
paper 
or 
plastic 
. 
once 
my 
groceries 
were 
all 
packed ScrEv_pack_groceries
neatly 
into 
my 
cart 
, 
i 
took ScrEv_bring_vehicle
them 
to 
my 
car 
, 
loaded ScrEv_bring_vehicle
them 
into 
my 
trunk 
and 
then 
put ScrEv_return_shop_cart
the 
empty 
cart 
into 
the 
cart 
area 
. 
<end_of_story>_grocery 
this 
afternoon 
, 
i 
headed ScrEv_go_grocery
to 
my 
neighborhood 
supermarket 
to 
buy+groceries Evoking_grocery
. 
luckily 
, 
the 
place 
was UnrelEv_grocery
only 
a 
block 
away 
from 
my 
apartment 
and 
basically 
right 
next 
door 
to 
me 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_grocery
a 
bit 
chilly 
outside 
, 
so 
i 
put+on Unclear_grocery
a 
jacket 
and 
my 
shopping 
bag 
, 
then 
quickly 
wrote+down ScrEv_make_list
a 
grocery 
items 
. 
i 
walked ScrEv_go_grocery
my 
way 
to 
the 
supermarket 
and 
then 
got+a+hold ScrEv_take_shop_cart
of 
a 
shopping 
basket 
. 
my 
first 
stop 
was UnrelEv_grocery
the 
produce 
section 
, 
where 
i 
picked+up ScrEv_get_groceries
some 
produce 
like 
bell 
peppers 
, 
onions 
, 
and 
garlic 
.

i 
headed ScrEv_move_section
to

section 
, 
where 
i 
got ScrEv_get_groceries
a 
pack 
of 
gouda 
cheese 
and 
a 
liter 
container 
of 
milk 
. 
my 
next 
stop 
was UnrelEv_grocery
one 
of 
the 
supermarket 
's 
middle 
aisles 
to 
get ScrEv_get_groceries
a 
box 
of 
pasta 
and 
tomato 
sauce 
. 
i 
had 
found ScrEv_get_groceries
everything 
i 
needed UnrelEv_grocery
for 
the 
week 
, 
so 
i 
went ScrEv_go_checkout
over 
to 
the 
checkout 
counters 
. 
this 
was UnrelEv_grocery
a 
bit 
of 
a 
wait ScrEv_wait
, 
as 
the 
store 
was UnrelEv_grocery
pretty 
packed 
with 
shoppers 
. 
fortunately 
, 
i 
found RelNScrEv_grocery
a 
line 
that 
was UnrelEv_grocery
relatively 
less 
crowded 
. 
a 
few 
minutes 
later 
, 
i 
placed ScrEv_put_conveyor
my 
items 
onto 
the 
checkout 
aisle 
and 
had 
them 
scanned ScrEv_cashier_scan/weight
. 
the 
checkout 
clerk 
then 
ran+up RelNScrEv_grocery
my 
total 
, 
after 
which 
i 
paid ScrEv_pay
with 
my 
debit 
card 
and 
placed ScrEv_pack_groceries
my 
groceries 
into 
my 
shopping 
bag 
. 
once 
i 
was UnrelEv_grocery
all 
set 
, 
i 
headed+back ScrEv_leave
to 
my 
apartment 
. 
<end_of_story>_grocery 
i 
went+grocery+shopping Evoking_grocery
today 
. 
i 
made ScrEv_make_list
a 
list 
of 
things 
that 
i 
needed UnrelEv_grocery
before 
i 
left UnrelEv_grocery
my 
house 
. 
when 
i 
got ScrEv_go_grocery
to 
the 
grocery 
store 
, 
i 
walked ScrEv_enter
in 
the 
door 
and 
got ScrEv_take_shop_cart
a 
shopping 
cart 
. 
the 
next 
thing 
i 
did UnrelEv_grocery
was 
look ScrEv_check_list
at 
my 
list 
to 
see UnrelEv_grocery
which 
items 
i 
needed 
to 
find RelNScrEv_grocery
. 
my 
list 
said UnrelEv_grocery
i 
needed 
to 
get ScrEv_get_groceries
bread 
, 
cheese 
and 
milk 
. 
first 
i 
went ScrEv_move_section
to 
the 
aisle 
of 
bread 
. 
there 
were UnrelEv_grocery
at 
least 
twenty 
different 
kinds 
of 
bread 
. 
i 
picked+out ScrEv_get_groceries
my 
favorite 
kind 
of 
bread 
, 
which 
is UnrelEv_grocery
whole 
wheat 
, 
and 
put ScrEv_get_groceries
it 
in 
my 
shopping 
cart 
. 
next 
i 
went ScrEv_move_section
to 
the 
dairy 
section 
of 
the 
store 
where 
i 
put ScrEv_get_groceries
a 
gallon 
of 
milk 
and 
a 
block 
of 
cheese 
into 
my 
cart 
. 
i 
then 
took ScrEv_go_checkout
my 
cart 
up 
to 
the 
front 
of 
the 
store 
where 
the 
cash 
registers 
where 
located UnrelEv_grocery
. 
i 
put ScrEv_put_conveyor
my 
items 
on 
one 
of 
the 
counters 
and 
a 
lady 
scanned ScrEv_cashier_scan/weight
each 
of 
them 
. 
she 
told ScrEv_get_receipt
me 
how 
much 
my 
groceries 
cost RelNScrEv_grocery
and 
i 
gave ScrEv_pay
her 
the 
money 
to 
pay ScrEv_pay
for 
them 
. 
a 
boy 
took ScrEv_pack_groceries
my 
groceries 
from 
the 
counter 
and 
put ScrEv_pack_groceries
them 
in 
a 
bag 
. 
he 
handed RelNScrEv_grocery
me 
the 
bag 
and 
thanked RelNScrEv_grocery
me 
for

with 
them 
today

finally 
, 
i 
left ScrEv_leave

<end_of_story>_grocery 
i 
was 
hosting UnrelEv_grocery
a 
party 
and 
needed 
to 
pick+up+some+groceries Evoking_grocery
for

i 
started UnrelEv_grocery
by 
making ScrEv_make_list
a 
list 
of 
all 
the 
food 
i 
needed 
to 
buy ScrEv_get_groceries

then 
i 
grabbed ScrEv_take_bags
my 
reusable 
shopping 
bags 
and 
drove ScrEv_go_grocery
to 
the 
grocery 
store 
. 
i 
chose ScrEv_take_shop_cart

from 
outside 
and 
picked+up UnrelEv_grocery
a 
copy 
of 
the 
grocery 
store 
ad 
from 
the 
front 
of 
the 
store 
. 
i 
walked ScrEv_move_section
through 
all 
the 
aisles 
pushing RelNScrEv_grocery

cart 
. 
i 
picked+out ScrEv_get_groceries
the 
food

needed UnrelEv_grocery
from 
my 
list 
, 
making 
sure 
to 
choose ScrEv_get_groceries
food 
that 
was UnrelEv_grocery
on 
sale 
or 
generic 
food 
. 
when 
i 
had 
checked ScrEv_check_off
everything 
off 
on 
my 
list 
, 
i 
got ScrEv_go_checkout
in 
line 
at 
the 
store 
checkouts 
. 
there 
was UnrelEv_grocery
a 
friendly 
cashier 
who 
scanned ScrEv_cashier_scan/weight
all 
of 
my 
groceries 
and 
told RelNScrEv_grocery
me 
how 
much 
money

cost RelNScrEv_grocery
. 
there 
was UnrelEv_grocery
also 
a 
friendly 
bagger 
who 
put ScrEv_pack_groceries
all 
on 
my 
groceries 
in 
my 
bags 
. 
at 
the 
end 
, 
the 
bagger 
offered UnrelEv_grocery
to 
help UnrelEv_grocery
put ScrEv_bring_vehicle
all 
of 
my 
groceries 
in 
the 
cart 
. 
as 
i 
left ScrEv_leave
the 
parking 
lot 
, 
i 
waved UnrelEv_grocery
goodbye 
to 
him 
after 
my 
successful 
trip 
. 
<end_of_story>_grocery 
it 
is UnrelEv_grocery
saturday 
morning 
and 
my 
mother 
wakes UnrelEv_grocery
me 
early 
. 
every 
saturday 
morning 
is UnrelEv_grocery
grocery 
day 
. 
my 
mother 
likes 
to 
shop Evoking_grocery
by 
the 
week 
. 
the 
store 
is UnrelEv_grocery
huge 
. 
as 
we 
walk+in ScrEv_enter
we 
get ScrEv_take_shop_cart
a 
shopping 
cart 
and 
start UnrelEv_grocery
down 
the 
1st 
aisle 
. 
fruits 
and 
vegetables 
all 
stacked UnrelEv_grocery
neatly 
in 
shelves 
. 
potatoes 
in 
bags 
stacked UnrelEv_grocery
next 
to 
the 
onions 
. 
grapes 
in 
big 
bunches 
. 
this 
is UnrelEv_grocery
my 
favorite 
aisle 
. 
i 
love UnrelEv_grocery
the 
colors 
and 
the 
shapes 
. 
here 
you 
can 
find RelNScrEv_grocery
some 
stuff 
i 
have 
never 
seen UnrelEv_grocery
before 
. 
star 
fruit 
, 
miniature 
bananas 
and 
blood 
oranges 
. 
we 
spend UnrelEv_grocery
most 
of 
our 
time 
here 
. 
we 
are UnrelEv_grocery
vegetarians 
so 
we 
do 
not 
go ScrEv_move_section
to 
the 
meat 
counter 
or 
the 
dairy 
aisle 
. 
we 
do 
go ScrEv_move_section
to 
the 
cereal 
aisle 
and 
i 
beg UnrelEv_grocery
my 
mother 
every 
week 
for 
a 
different 
cereal 
treat 
. 
sometimes 
she 
says UnrelEv_grocery
yes 
and 
others 
no 
. 
but 
this 
week 
is UnrelEv_grocery
yes 
and 
frosted 
flakes 
get 
tossed ScrEv_get_groceries
in 
the 
cart 
with 
delight 
. 
i 
am UnrelEv_grocery
so 
excited 
about 
this 
that 
i 
do 
not 
pay UnrelEv_grocery
much 
attention 
to 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
trip 
. 
i 
help UnrelEv_grocery
my 
mom 
bag ScrEv_pack_groceries
the 
groceries 
and 
put ScrEv_bring_vehicle
the 
bags 
in 
the 
trunk 
of 
the 
car 
. 
when 
we 
get ScrEv_leave
home 
it 
all 
unloaded RelNScrEv_grocery
and 
put+away RelNScrEv_grocery
and 
then 
it 
is UnrelEv_grocery
time 
for 
some 
frosted 
flake 
goodness 
.

i

items 
off 
my

department 
and 
asked RelNScrEv_grocery
the 
butcher 
to

some 
eggs 
,

i 
placed ScrEv_put_conveyor

were UnrelEv_grocery
on 
my 
list 
. 
they 
were UnrelEv_grocery
by 
the 
front 
door 
, 
so 
i 
picked ScrEv_get_groceries
some 
out 
and 
put ScrEv_get_groceries
them 
in 
my 
basket 
. 
i 
also 
needed UnrelEv_grocery
peanut 
butter 
, 
which 
was UnrelEv_grocery
at 
the 
back 
of 
the 
store 
. 
i 
went ScrEv_move_section
to 
the 
back 
and 
chose ScrEv_get_groceries
my 
favorite 
peanut 
butter 
. 
the 
last 
thing 
i 
needed UnrelEv_grocery
was 
bread 
. 
i 
walked ScrEv_move_section
down 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
store 
looking RelNScrEv_grocery
down 
each 
aisle 
to 
see UnrelEv_grocery
if 
i 
saw RelNScrEv_grocery
anything 
that 
i 
forgot UnrelEv_grocery
to 
put UnrelEv_grocery
on 
my 
list 
. 
i 
did 
n't 
see RelNScrEv_grocery
anything 
i 
needed UnrelEv_grocery
, 
but 
had 
to 
resist UnrelEv_grocery
the 
temptation 
to 
buy ScrEv_get_groceries
some 
ice 
cream 
. 
once 
i 
got ScrEv_move_section
to 
the 
front 
of 
the 
store 
, 
i 
picked+out ScrEv_get_groceries
a 
loaf 
of 
bread 
and 
went ScrEv_go_checkout
to 
stand ScrEv_wait
in 
line 
to 
check 
out 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_grocery
busy 
, 
but 
a 
new 
line 
was 
just 
opening+up UnrelEv_grocery
, 
so 
i 
was 
able 
to 
get UnrelEv_grocery
near 
the 
front 
of 
the 
line 
. 
the 
cashier 
rang ScrEv_cashier_scan/weight
me 
up 
and 
i 
paid ScrEv_pay
with 
my 
debit 
card 
. 
i 
put ScrEv_pack_groceries
my 
groceries 
in 
a 
paper 
bag 
. 
then 
i 
left ScrEv_leave
the 
store 
and 
drove ScrEv_leave
home 
. 
<end_of_story>_grocery 
i 
had 
just 
finished 
eating UnrelEv_grocery
my 
lunch 
and 
knew UnrelEv_grocery
it 
was UnrelEv_grocery
time 
to 
go 
grocery+shopping Evoking_grocery
for 
the 
week 
. 
i 
always 
buy+my+groceries Evoking_grocery
all 
at 
one 
time 
for 
the 
week 
and 
then 
cook UnrelEv_grocery
everything 
over 
the 
weekend 
so 
that 
i 
do 
n't 
have 
to 
cook UnrelEv_grocery
on 
a 
daily 
basis 
. 
anyway 
, 
i 
hopped RelNScrEv_grocery
in 
my 
car 
and 
drove ScrEv_go_grocery
to 
walmart 
which 
is UnrelEv_grocery
where 
i 
usually 
do UnrelEv_grocery
all 
my 
grocery+shopping Evoking_grocery
. 
i 
found RelNScrEv_grocery
a 
parking 
space 
close 
to 
the 
entrance 
because 
i 
knew UnrelEv_grocery
i 
was 
going 
to 
buy ScrEv_get_groceries
a 
lot 
. 
i 
got RelNScrEv_grocery
out 
of 
the 
car 
, 
walked ScrEv_enter
through 
the 
store 
doors 
, 
and 
grabbed ScrEv_take_shop_cart
a 
shopping 
cart 
along 
the 
way 
. 
i 
made ScrEv_move_section
my 
way 
down 
the 
fruit 
and 
vegetable 
aisles 
first 
, 
picking+up ScrEv_get_groceries
bananas 
, 
oranges 
, 
salad 
mix 
, 
and 
kale 
along 
the 
way 
. 
i 
then 
added ScrEv_get_groceries
some 
fish 
, 
chicken 
, 
hamburger 
meat 
, 
and 
pork 
to 
my 
cart 
. 
moving+along ScrEv_move_section
down 
the 
aisles 
, 
i 
picked+up ScrEv_get_groceries
all 
the 
dairy 
goods 
, 
spices 
, 
and 
snacks 
i 
would 
need UnrelEv_grocery
for 
the 
week 
. 
with 
my 
cart 
stacked UnrelEv_grocery
high 
, 
i 
headed ScrEv_go_checkout
to 
the 
check 
out 
line 
where 
the 
cashier 
greeted RelNScrEv_grocery
me 
warmly 
and 
began 
ringing ScrEv_cashier_scan/weight
my 
items 
up 
. 
my 
total 
came UnrelEv_grocery
to 
$ 
523 
which 
was UnrelEv_grocery
a 
lot 
of 
money 
but 
definitely 
worth 
it 
. 
the 
cashier 
bagged ScrEv_pack_groceries
my 
groceries 
as 
i 
paid ScrEv_pay
. 
then 
, 
i 
pushed ScrEv_bring_vehicle
my 
cart 
full 
of 
groceries 
out 
of 
the 
store 
and 
to 
the 
parking 
lot 
where 
i 
would 
load ScrEv_bring_vehicle
them 
into 
my 
trunk 
. 
i 
put ScrEv_return_shop_cart
the 
cart 
in 
the 
cart 
holding 
area 
and 
drove ScrEv_leave
away 
. 
<end_of_story>_grocery 
the 
previous 
night 
and 
this 
morning 
before 
work 
i 
noticed UnrelEv_grocery
i 
was 
missing UnrelEv_grocery
a 
lot 
of 
necessary 
ingredients 
for 
my 
future 
meals 
. 
i 
planned+out UnrelEv_grocery
a 
trip 
to 
the 
grocery 
store 
immediately 
after 
work 
. 
after 
i 
finished 
working UnrelEv_grocery
i 
drove ScrEv_go_grocery
over 
to 
the 
store 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_grocery
very 
crowded 
but 
not 
too 
hard 
to 
find RelNScrEv_grocery
a 
parking 
spot 
. 
once 
inside 
the 
store 
, 
i 
grabbed ScrEv_take_shop_cart
the 
nearest 
shopping 
cart 
and 
smiled UnrelEv_grocery
as 
one 
of 
the 
grocery 
workers 
welcomed UnrelEv_grocery
me 
in 
. 
once 
inside 
and 
out 
of 
everyone 
's 
way 
, 
i 
thought UnrelEv_grocery
about 
what 
i 
needed UnrelEv_grocery
. 
since 
i 
did 
n't 
have UnrelEv_grocery
a 
list 
written+down ScrEv_make_list
, 
it 
took UnrelEv_grocery
me 
a 
few 
minutes 
. 
once 
i 
came+up Unclear_grocery
with 
the 
list 
in 
my 
head 
, 
i 
started 
to 
map UnrelEv_grocery
out 
a 
route 
in 
my 
head 
that 
would 
take UnrelEv_grocery
the 
least 
amount 
of 
time 
for 
me 
to 
follow UnrelEv_grocery
in 
the 
store 
. 
first 
, 
i 
picked+up ScrEv_get_groceries
my 
deli 
. 
they 
offered RelNScrEv_grocery
me 
some 
free 
samples 
of 
the 
meat 
i 
asked RelNScrEv_grocery
for 
. 
then 
i 
picked+up ScrEv_get_groceries
my 
bread 
which 
was UnrelEv_grocery
right 
nearby 
. 
at 
the 
back 
wall 
of 
the 
store 
i 
found RelNScrEv_grocery
the 
meat 
i 
was 
going 
to 
cook UnrelEv_grocery
tonight 
. 
after 
that 
, 
i 
grabbed ScrEv_get_groceries
a 
few 
extra 
items 
that 
i 
thought UnrelEv_grocery
might 
also 
be UnrelEv_grocery
nice 
later 
this 
week 
while 
heading ScrEv_go_checkout
towards 
checkout 
. 
luckily 
, 
there 
was UnrelEv_grocery
n't 
a 
line 
and 
this 
was 
done UnrelEv_grocery
quickly 
. 
i 
paid ScrEv_pay
with 
my 
debit 
card 
and 
left ScrEv_bring_vehicle
with 
all 
my 
groceries 
in 
a 
cart 
, 
packed ScrEv_bring_vehicle
them 
into 
my 
car 
, 
and 
headed ScrEv_leave
home 
. 
<end_of_story>_grocery 
yesterday 
i 
did UnrelEv_grocery
my 
weekly 
grocery+shopping Evoking_grocery
. 
i 
began UnrelEv_grocery
the 
day 
by 
checking RelNScrEv_grocery
my 
cupboards 
and 
refrigerator 
to 
see UnrelEv_grocery
what 
we 
were 
out 
of 
or 
running+low UnrelEv_grocery
on 
. 
as 
i 
came+across UnrelEv_grocery
items 
i 
needed 
, 
i 
wrote ScrEv_make_list
them 
down 
on 
a 
piece 
of 
paper 
, 
which 
i 
planned UnrelEv_grocery
to 
take UnrelEv_grocery
with 
me 
to 
the 
store 
. 
that 
way 
, 
i 
would 
n't 
have 
to 
rely UnrelEv_grocery
on 
my 
memory 
and 
forget UnrelEv_grocery
anything 
. 
i 
gathered ScrEv_take_bags
together 
my 
cloth 
grocery 
bags 
and 
put ScrEv_take_bags
them 
in 
the 
car 
, 
then 
drove ScrEv_go_grocery
to 
the 
store 
. 
before 
heading ScrEv_enter
in 
, 
i 
got ScrEv_take_shop_cart
a 
grocery 
cart 
from 
outside 
the 
store 
, 
and 
took+out ScrEv_check_list
my 
shopping 
list 
. 
as 
i 
went ScrEv_move_section
up 
and 
down 
the 
aisles 
, 
i 
crossed+off ScrEv_check_off
items 
on 
my 
grocery 
list 
as 
i 
placed ScrEv_get_groceries
the 
items 
in 
the 
cart 
. 
when 
all 
the 
items 
on 
my 
list 
were UnrelEv_grocery
in 
the 
cart 
, 
i 
wheeled ScrEv_go_checkout
the 
cart 
to 
the 
check-out 
line 
. 
i 
had 
to 
wait ScrEv_wait
in 
line 
since 
there 
were UnrelEv_grocery
some 
people 
ahead 
of 
me 
. 
when 
it 
was UnrelEv_grocery
my 
turn 
, 
i 
took ScrEv_put_conveyor
the 
items 
out 
of 
my 
cart 
and 
placed ScrEv_put_conveyor
them 
on 
the 
conveyor 
belt 
that 
brought UnrelEv_grocery
them 
up 
to 
the 
cashier 
. 
she 
took UnrelEv_grocery
each 
item 
and 
swiped ScrEv_cashier_scan/weight
its 
bar 
code 
over 
a 
screen 
that 
gave UnrelEv_grocery
her 
the 
price 
. 
when 
all 
the 
items 
had 
been 
checked+out ScrEv_cashier_scan/weight
, 
she 
told ScrEv_other_grocery
me 
what 
the 
total 
would 
be UnrelEv_grocery
. 
i 
paid ScrEv_pay
for 
the 
groceries 
, 
and 
then 
wheeled ScrEv_move_section
my 
cart 
over 
to 
an 
area 
where 
i 
could 
place ScrEv_pack_groceries
the 
groceries 
into 
my 
reusable 
bags 
. 
once 
that 
was 
done UnrelEv_grocery
, 
i 
pushed ScrEv_bring_vehicle
the 
cart 
through 
the 
parking 
lot 
to 
my 
car 
, 
where 
i 
loaded ScrEv_bring_vehicle
the 
bags 
of 
groceries 
into 
my 
car 
, 
and 
drove ScrEv_leave
home 
. 
when 
i 
got RelNScrEv_grocery
home 
, 
i 
took RelNScrEv_grocery
the 
bags 
into 
the 
house 
and 
removed RelNScrEv_grocery
all 
the 
items 
from 
them 
. 
putting RelNScrEv_grocery
the 
groceries 
away 
in 
the 
cupboards 
and 
refrigerator 
was UnrelEv_grocery
the 
final 
step 
of 
grocery+shopping Evoking_grocery
day 
. 
<end_of_story>_grocery 
i 
went ScrEv_go_grocery
to 
the 
corner 
market 
with 
my 
list 
of 
things 
i 
needed 
to 
buy Unclear_grocery
. 
i 
grabbed ScrEv_take_shop_cart
a 
shopping 
cart 
and 
wheeled ScrEv_move_section
it 
up 
and 
down 
the 
aisles 
. 
i 
started UnrelEv_grocery
at 
aisle 
one 
and 
went ScrEv_move_section
through 
each 
one 
in 
order 
to 
make 
sure 
that 
i 
got ScrEv_get_groceries
everything 
i 
needed UnrelEv_grocery
. 
fruit 
and 
vegetables 
were 
placed ScrEv_get_groceries
in 
flimsy 
plastic 
bags 
that 
the 
market 
provided UnrelEv_grocery
for 
me 
. 
i 
got ScrEv_get_groceries
eggs 
and 
placed ScrEv_get_groceries
them 
in 
the 
cart 
's 
basket 
so 
they 
would 
n't 
get 
broken UnrelEv_grocery
. 
all 
other 
items 
were 
tossed ScrEv_get_groceries
in 
the 
cart 
. 
after 
i 
got ScrEv_get_groceries
everything 
on 
my 
list 
, 
i 
rolled ScrEv_go_checkout
the 
cart 
to 
the 
cashier 
. 
he 
scanned ScrEv_cashier_scan/weight
all 
my 
products 
and 
gave ScrEv_get_receipt
me 
a 
final 
, 
total 
price 
. 
a 
grocery 
bagger 
put ScrEv_pack_groceries
all 
of 
my 
items 
in 
paper 
bags 
. 
i 
paid ScrEv_pay
the 
cashier 
in 
cash 
and 
he 
gave RelNScrEv_grocery
me 
change 
. 
i 
thanked RelNScrEv_grocery
him 
, 
i 
thanked RelNScrEv_grocery
the 
bagger 
, 
and 
then 
i 
left ScrEv_leave
with 
my 
groceries 
. 
<end_of_story>_grocery 
last 
saturday 
i 
decided UnrelEv_grocery
to 
go+grocery+shopping Evoking_grocery
. 
we 
seemed 
to 
be UnrelEv_grocery
out 
of 
a 
number 
of 
things 
in 
our 
house 
that 
we 
needed 
to 
cook UnrelEv_grocery
with 
, 
so 
i 
sat+down UnrelEv_grocery
a 
made ScrEv_make_list
a 
list 
of 
items 
. 
it 
seemed 
to 
be UnrelEv_grocery
really 
large 
, 
so 
i 
knew UnrelEv_grocery
i 
would 
be UnrelEv_grocery
gone 
for 
a 
while 
. 
i 
drove ScrEv_go_grocery
to 
the 
grocery 
store 
that 
i 
like 
the 
best 
, 
and 
parked RelNScrEv_grocery
my 
car 
. 
i 
got ScrEv_take_shop_cart
a 
large 
shopping 
cart 
instead 
of 
the 
smaller 
one 
, 
since 
i 
knew UnrelEv_grocery
i 
had UnrelEv_grocery
a 
lot 
of 
items 
to 
purchase ScrEv_get_groceries
. 
very 
slowly 
, 
i 
went ScrEv_move_section
up 
and 
down 
each 
row 
in 
the 
grocery 
store 
. 
i 
checked ScrEv_check_list
my 
list 
on 
each 
row 
, 
and 
got ScrEv_get_groceries
the 
items 
that 
i 
needed UnrelEv_grocery
. 
i 
made 
sure 
to 
cross ScrEv_check_off
the 
item 
off 
when 
i 
put ScrEv_get_groceries
it 
in 
my 
cart 
, 
so 
i 
knew UnrelEv_grocery
that 
i 
did 
n't 
forget UnrelEv_grocery
anything 
. 
along 
the 
way 
, 
i 
saw RelNScrEv_grocery
some 
items 
that 
were UnrelEv_grocery
on 
sale 
, 
and 
decided UnrelEv_grocery
to 
purchase ScrEv_get_groceries
those 
as 
well 
, 
knowing 
we 
would 
use UnrelEv_grocery
them 
. 
i 
bought ScrEv_get_groceries
the 
cold 
and 
frozen 
items 
last 
, 
so 
they 
would 
still 
be UnrelEv_grocery
cold 
by 
the 
time 
i 
got ScrEv_leave
home 
. 
when 
i 
had 
crossed+off ScrEv_check_off
everything 
on 
my 
list 
, 
i 
went ScrEv_go_checkout
to 
the 
front 
of 
the 
store 
. 
i 
found RelNScrEv_grocery
an 
open 
cash 
register 
lane 
, 
and 
put ScrEv_put_conveyor
my 
items 
on 
the 
conveyor 
belt 
. 
the 
cashier 
was UnrelEv_grocery
very 
friendly 
and 
said RelNScrEv_grocery
hello 
. 
she 
began 
scanning ScrEv_cashier_scan/weight
each 
of 
my 
items 
, 
and 
even 
had 
to 
weigh ScrEv_cashier_scan/weight
some 
of 
them 
. 
a 
nice 
man 
was 
putting ScrEv_pack_groceries
my 
groceries 
into 
bags 
for 
me 
, 
and 
putting RelNScrEv_grocery
them 
in 
my 
cart 
as 
he 
filled ScrEv_pack_groceries
the 
bags 
. 
when 
they 
were UnrelEv_grocery
done 
, 
i 
paid ScrEv_pay
the 
cashier 
the 
amount 
due 
, 
and 
she 
gave RelNScrEv_grocery
me 
my 
change 
, 
which 
i 
put RelNScrEv_grocery
in 
my 
purse 
. 
the 
bagger 
walked ScrEv_bring_vehicle
with 
me 
out 
to 
my 
car 
and 
helped UnrelEv_grocery
me 
put ScrEv_bring_vehicle
the 
groceries 
in 
the 
trunk 
of 
my 
car 
. 
i 
said RelNScrEv_grocery
thank 
you 
to 
him 
, 
and 
then 
drove ScrEv_leave
home 
. 
when 
i 
got ScrEv_leave
there 
, 
it 
took UnrelEv_grocery
a 
while 
to 
bring RelNScrEv_grocery
all 
of 
the 
bags 
inside 
, 
but 
my 
children 
helped UnrelEv_grocery
me 
. 
we 
all 
had UnrelEv_grocery
fun 
putting RelNScrEv_grocery
the 
groceries 
away 
, 
and 
were UnrelEv_grocery
glad 
the 
shelves 
were UnrelEv_grocery
filled 
with 
what 
we 
needed UnrelEv_grocery
again 
. 
<end_of_story>_grocery 
being UnrelEv_grocery
that 
we 
needed UnrelEv_grocery
food 
in 
the 
house 
, 
i 
went RelNScrEv_grocery
through 
the 
cupboards 
and 
refrigerator 
to 
see RelNScrEv_grocery
what 
was 
there 
and 
made ScrEv_make_list
a 
list 
of 
what 
we 
needed UnrelEv_grocery
. 
we 
were UnrelEv_grocery
almost 
out 
of 
food 
so 
it 
was UnrelEv_grocery
a 
long 
list 
. 
then 
i 
drove ScrEv_go_grocery
to 
the 
grocery 
store 
. 
first 
i 
went ScrEv_move_section
to 
the 
meat 
isle 
and 
picked+out ScrEv_get_groceries
some 
juicy 
steaks 
and 
a 
chicken 
. 
then 
i 
went ScrEv_move_section
the 
the 
vegetable 
isle 
and 
picked+out ScrEv_get_groceries
some 
fresh 
asparagus 
, 
broccoli 
, 
and 
salad 
fixings 
. 
next 
i 
went ScrEv_move_section
to 
the 
canned 
goods 
and 
picked+out ScrEv_get_groceries
some 
cans 
to 
keep UnrelEv_grocery
in 
the 
house 
. 
i 
picked+out ScrEv_get_groceries
some 
chili 
, 
soups 
and 
stews 
. 
these 
are UnrelEv_grocery
always 
good 
to 
have UnrelEv_grocery
in 
the 
house 
for 
a 
quick 
meal 
. 
then 
i 
went ScrEv_move_section
to 
the 
dairy 
section 
and 
picked+out ScrEv_get_groceries
some 
sour 
cream 
and 
milk 
. 
then 
i 
pushed ScrEv_go_checkout
the 
cart 
to 
the 
payment 
isles 
and 
paid ScrEv_pay
for 
the 
groceries 
. 
<end_of_story>_grocery 
i 
needed 
to 
do UnrelEv_grocery
my 
weekly 
grocery+shopping Evoking_grocery
. 
i 
prepared UnrelEv_grocery
by 
first 
looking RelNScrEv_grocery
through 
my 
cupboards 
and 
the 
refrigerator 
and 
freezer 
to 
see RelNScrEv_grocery
what 
i 
already 
had UnrelEv_grocery
and 
what 
i 
needed UnrelEv_grocery
. 
then 
i 
made ScrEv_make_list
a 
list 
by 
category 
of 
everything 
i 
needed UnrelEv_grocery
for 
the 
upcoming 
week 
. 
i 
drove ScrEv_go_grocery
to 
shopper 
's 
food 
warehouse 
, 
parked RelNScrEv_grocery
the 
car 
, 
found ScrEv_take_shop_cart
a 
cart 
near 
the 
front 
door 
and 
went+in ScrEv_enter
to 
begin UnrelEv_grocery
my 
shopping Evoking_grocery
. 
i 
started UnrelEv_grocery
in 
the 
produce 
section 
and 
picked+out ScrEv_get_groceries
everything 
i 
needed UnrelEv_grocery
in 
the 
way 
of 
fruits 
and 
vegetables 
. 
then 
i 
shopped ScrEv_get_groceries
for 
meats 
, 
cheeses 
, 
canned 
goods 
, 
milk 
, 
eggs 
, 
juice 
, 
bread 
, 
cereal 
, 
paper 
products 
, 
and 
frozen 
items 
. 
i 
went ScrEv_go_checkout
through 
the 
check-out 
line 
with 
my 
purchases 
and 
paid ScrEv_pay
with 
a 
credit 
card 
. 
the 
cashier 
bagged ScrEv_pack_groceries
all 
my 
items 
and 
put RelNScrEv_grocery
them 
back 
in 
the 
cart 
. 
i 
rolled ScrEv_bring_vehicle
the 
cart 
close 
to 
my 
car 
and 
unloaded ScrEv_bring_vehicle
the 
bags 
into 
the 
trunk 
of 
my 
car 
, 
then 
went ScrEv_leave
home 
and 
put RelNScrEv_grocery
everything 
away 
. 
<end_of_story>_grocery 
every 
sunday 
i 
check RelNScrEv_grocery
our 
pantry 
, 
fridge 
and 
freezer 
to 
see RelNScrEv_grocery
what 
i 
need 
to 
buy ScrEv_get_groceries
from 
the 
grocery 
store 
. 
i 
also 
have 
to 
check RelNScrEv_grocery
the 
pet 
supplies 
as 
i 
have UnrelEv_grocery
dogs 
and 
cats 
that 
eat UnrelEv_grocery
a 
lot 
! 
i 
carry UnrelEv_grocery
a 
piece 
of 
paper 
with 
me 
and 
write+down ScrEv_make_list
what 
i 
need 
to 
get ScrEv_get_groceries
. 
i 
also 
have UnrelEv_grocery
an 
idea 
of 
what 
meals 
i 
intend 
to 
cook UnrelEv_grocery
during 
the 
week 
and 
what 
ingredients 
i 
will 
need UnrelEv_grocery
to 
make UnrelEv_grocery
those 
meals 
, 
so 
i 
add ScrEv_make_list
them 
to 
the 
list 
. 
i 
know UnrelEv_grocery
which 
store 
or 
stores 
i 
am 
going 
to 
visit ScrEv_go_grocery
and 
i 
know UnrelEv_grocery
the 
layout 
of 
the 
store 
so 
i 
try 
and 
make ScrEv_make_list
my 
list 
in 
the 
same 
order 
that 
the 
items 
will 
be 
found RelNScrEv_grocery
once 
i 
get 
there 
. 
i 
pick+up ScrEv_take_shop_cart
a 
cart 
on 
the 
way 
into 
the 
store 
and 
head ScrEv_move_section
for 
the 
first 
aisle 
that 
i 
need 
to 
visit UnrelEv_grocery
. 
most 
supermarkets 
have UnrelEv_grocery
their 
frozen 
foods 
at 
one 
end 
so 
i 
start UnrelEv_grocery
at 
the 
other 
end 
as 
it 
is UnrelEv_grocery
best 
to 
buy ScrEv_get_groceries
frozen 
items 
last 
so 
they 
do 
n't 
start 
to 
melt UnrelEv_grocery
while 
i 
'm 
walking ScrEv_move_section
round 
the 
store 
. 
i 
work UnrelEv_grocery
my 
way 
through 
my 
shopping 
list 
, 
selecting ScrEv_get_groceries
items 
off 
the 
shelf 
and 
placing ScrEv_get_groceries
them 
into 
my 
cart 
, 
trying 
not 
to 
squash UnrelEv_grocery
lighter 
things 
under 
heavy 
things 
and 
also 
making 
sure 
i 
buy ScrEv_get_groceries
items 
that 
have UnrelEv_grocery
a 
use 
by 
date 
that 
is UnrelEv_grocery
later 
than 
the 
day 
i 
intend 
to 
use UnrelEv_grocery
them 
. 
i 
am 
also 
keeping UnrelEv_grocery
an 
approximate 
idea 
of 
how 
much 
everything 
costs RelNScrEv_grocery
so 
i 
have UnrelEv_grocery
some 
idea 
of 
my 
total 
bill 
. 
when 
i 
am UnrelEv_grocery
done 
with 
everything 
i 
wait ScrEv_wait
at 
a 
checkout 
. 
there 
is UnrelEv_grocery
nearly 
always 
someone 
in 
front 
of 
me 
but 
the 
checkout 
people 
work UnrelEv_grocery
fast 
and 
i 
never 
wait ScrEv_wait
for 
long 
. 
i 
place ScrEv_put_conveyor
all 
my 
items 
on 
the 
conveyor 
belt 
and 
the 
person 
on 
the 
checkout 
counter 
scans ScrEv_cashier_scan/weight
them 
for 
prices 
. 
the 
prices 
all 
add+up RelNScrEv_grocery
on 
a 
screen 
in 
front 
of 
me 
so 
i 
can 
see UnrelEv_grocery
how 
much 
i 
am 
spending ScrEv_pay
. 
while 
the 
checkout 
person 
scans ScrEv_cashier_scan/weight
my 
items 
another 
shop 
assistant 
packs ScrEv_pack_groceries
all 
my 
items 
carefully 
into 
bags 
and 
places RelNScrEv_grocery
them 
back 
in 
my 
cart 
. 
when 
i 
am 
finished UnrelEv_grocery
i 
am 
always 
asked RelNScrEv_grocery
if 
i 
need UnrelEv_grocery
any 
help 
taking ScrEv_bring_vehicle
my 
bags 
to 
the 
car 
but 
i 
always 
refuse UnrelEv_grocery
as 
i 
think UnrelEv_grocery
other 
people 
in 
the 
store 
need UnrelEv_grocery
help 
more 
than 
i 
do UnrelEv_grocery
. 
i 
load ScrEv_bring_vehicle
the 
car 
and 
drive ScrEv_leave
home 
and 
then 
have 
to 
put RelNScrEv_grocery
everything 
into 
the 
pantry 
, 
freezer 
or 
refrigerator 
. 
that 
is UnrelEv_grocery
my 
least 
favorite 
part 
of 
grocery+shopping Evoking_grocery
! 
<end_of_story>_grocery 
i 
love UnrelEv_grocery
going+grocery+shopping Evoking_grocery
! 
i 
have UnrelEv_grocery
a 
very 
specific 
way 
that 
i 
approach UnrelEv_grocery
it 
and 
i 
do UnrelEv_grocery
the 
same 
thing 
each 
week 
. 
on 
tuesdays 
, 
the 
grocery 
ads 
come+out UnrelEv_grocery
for 
the 
week 
. 
i 
look+through RelNScrEv_grocery
them 
and 
make ScrEv_make_list
a 
list 
of 
what 
is RelNScrEv_grocery
on 
sale 
. 
i 
meal+plan RelNScrEv_grocery
around 
those 
things 
. 
once 
i 
have ScrEv_make_list
a 
list 
of 
what 
i 
will 
be 
cooking UnrelEv_grocery
, 
i 
write ScrEv_make_list
those 
ingredients 
down 
along 
with 
all 
of 
the 
other 
things 
i 
want UnrelEv_grocery
or 
need UnrelEv_grocery
. 
i 
separate RelNScrEv_grocery
them 
by 
department 
. 
i 
put RelNScrEv_grocery
all 
of 
the 
dairy 
items 
together 
, 
then 
the 
meat 
items 
, 
followed UnrelEv_grocery
by 
the 
produce 
, 
and 
so 
on 
. 
this 
makes UnrelEv_grocery
it 
more 
efficient 
when 
i 
am 
pushing ScrEv_move_section
a 
cart 
through 
the 
store 
. 
once 
i 
'm UnrelEv_grocery
at 
the 
store 
, 
i 
select ScrEv_get_groceries
my 
items 
quickly 
. 
i 
usually 
buy ScrEv_get_groceries
the 
same 
brands 
and 
often 
the 
same 
items 
each 
week 
, 
so 
i 
know UnrelEv_grocery
where 
everything 
is UnrelEv_grocery
. 
when 
i 
'm UnrelEv_grocery
ready 
, 
i 
go ScrEv_go_checkout
to 
the 
checkout 
and 
put ScrEv_put_conveyor
it 
all 
on 
the 
belt 
so 
i 
can 
pay ScrEv_pay
for 
it 
. 
i 
love UnrelEv_grocery
grocery+shopping Evoking_grocery
but 
i 
hate UnrelEv_grocery
to 
put RelNScrEv_grocery
it 
all 
away 
when 
i 
get ScrEv_leave
home 
! 
<end_of_story>_grocery 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_grocery
to 
make UnrelEv_grocery
my 
girlfriend 
her 
favorite 
roasted 
chicken 
dinner 
a 
few 
days 
ago 
. 
i 
realized UnrelEv_grocery
that 
i 
did 
n't 
have UnrelEv_grocery
everything 
i 
needed UnrelEv_grocery
and 
had 
to 
go+the+grocery+store Evoking_grocery
for 
it 
. 
i 
drove ScrEv_go_grocery
to 
the 
store 
and 
got+out RelNScrEv_grocery
and 
walked ScrEv_enter
inside 
. 
after 
making ScrEv_make_list
a 
short 
list 
in 
my 
head 
, 
i 
wandered ScrEv_move_section
the 
aisles 
and 
grabbed ScrEv_get_groceries
the 
chicken 
, 
fresh 
vegetables 
and 
all 
of 
the 
necessary 
ingredients 
for 
the 
meal 
, 
as 
it 
has UnrelEv_grocery
a 
lot 
of 
them 
. 
after 
grabbing ScrEv_get_groceries
everything 
i 
needed UnrelEv_grocery
i 
then 
walked ScrEv_go_checkout
to 
the 
checkout 
counter 
. 
it 
was ScrEv_wait
a 
very 
long 
line 
and 
i 
had 
to 
wait ScrEv_wait
for 
a 
long 
time 
to 
purchase ScrEv_pay
my 
items 
. 
the 
cashier 
apologized RelNScrEv_grocery
over 
and 
over 
and 
thanked RelNScrEv_grocery
me 
for 
being RelNScrEv_grocery
so 
patient 
. 
i 
then 
paid ScrEv_pay
for 
my 
items 
and 
walked+out ScrEv_bring_vehicle
to 
my 
car 
. 
i 
placed ScrEv_bring_vehicle
the 
goods 
into 
it 
and 
made+sure UnrelEv_grocery
to 
put ScrEv_return_shop_cart
my 
shopping 
cart 
back 
into 
the 
area 
with 
the 
rest 
of 
them 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_grocery
a 
bit 
of 
a 
stressful 
visit 
to 
the 
grocery 
store 
, 
but 
in 
the 
end 
, 
i 
made UnrelEv_grocery
a 
successful 
dinner 
. 
<end_of_story>_grocery 
when 
i 
went+grocery+shopping Evoking_grocery
i 
started UnrelEv_grocery
by 
looking RelNScrEv_grocery
in 
my 
refrigerator 
and 
figuring+out RelNScrEv_grocery
what 
i 
needed 
to 
get ScrEv_get_groceries
. 
i 
made ScrEv_make_list
a 
shopping 
list 
based UnrelEv_grocery
on 
this 
. 
then 
i 
decided RelNScrEv_grocery
which 
store 
was UnrelEv_grocery
the 
best 
to 
go+to ScrEv_go_grocery
to 
buy ScrEv_get_groceries
these 
items 
. 
i 
decided RelNScrEv_grocery
that 
publix 
was UnrelEv_grocery
the 
best 
and 
closest 
store 
for 
me 
. 
i 
walked ScrEv_go_grocery
to 
the 
store 
with 
my 
empty 
backpack 
, 
and 
when 
i 
got+in ScrEv_enter
the 
first 
thing 
i 
did+was UnrelEv_grocery
check ScrEv_move_section
the 
clearance 
section 
and 
sales 
. 
after 
that 
i 
walked ScrEv_move_section
the 
aisle 
, 
making+sure UnrelEv_grocery
to 
pick+up ScrEv_get_groceries
everything 
that 
i 
needed RelNScrEv_grocery
. 
i 
avoided UnrelEv_grocery
using ScrEv_take_shop_cart
a 
shopping 
cart 
to 
be+sure UnrelEv_grocery
that 
i 
would 
not 
buy ScrEv_get_groceries
more 
than 
i 
could 
carry RelNScrEv_grocery
. 
after 
picking+up ScrEv_get_groceries
all 
the 
items 
i 
went ScrEv_go_checkout
to 
the 
checkout 
where 
i 
paid ScrEv_pay
for 
my 
purchases 
in 
cash 
. 
after 
that 
i 
put ScrEv_pack_groceries
the 
items 
in 
my 
backpack 
and 
walked+out ScrEv_leave
of 
the

and 
back 
to 
my 
house 
. 
<end_of_story>_grocery 
i 
looked RelNScrEv_grocery
into 
my 
fridge 
and 
realized UnrelEv_grocery
that 
i 
was RelNScrEv_grocery
out 
of 
food 
. 
i 
was UnrelEv_grocery
so 
hungry 
. 
i 
decided UnrelEv_grocery
that 
despite 
the 
fact 
that 
it 
was 
raining UnrelEv_grocery
outside 
, 
i 
was 
going 
to 
go+to+the+super+market Evoking_grocery
to 
buy+food Evoking_grocery
. 
i 
drove ScrEv_go_grocery
my 
car 
to 
the 
nearest 
supermarket 
, 
which 
was UnrelEv_grocery
about 
ten 
minutes 
away 
. 
once 
inside 
i 
took ScrEv_take_shop_cart
a 
shopping 
cart 
because 
i 
knew UnrelEv_grocery
i 
was 
going 
to 
stockpile Unclear_grocery
food 
. 
i 
first 
went ScrEv_move_section
to 
get ScrEv_get_groceries
breakfast 
food 
. 
this 
included ScrEv_get_groceries
eggs 
, 
bacon 
, 
milk 
, 
cereal 
, 
cereal 
bars 
and 
fruit 
such 
as 
bananas 
and 
apples 
. 
next 
i 
went ScrEv_move_section
to 
food 
i 
would 
usually 
eat UnrelEv_grocery
for 
lunch 
. 
this 
included ScrEv_get_groceries
pasta 
, 
tomato 
sauce 
, 
mac 
and 
cheese 
, 
ramen 
, 
salad 
ingredients 
and 
perhaps 
some 
snacks 
. 
i 
also 
got ScrEv_get_groceries
a 
pound 
of 
boar 
's 
head 
turkey 
and 
bread 
. 
i 
then 
went ScrEv_move_section
to 
pick+up ScrEv_get_groceries
a 
few 
slabs 
of 
steak 
, 
pork 
and 
chicken 
because 
i 
like UnrelEv_grocery
to 
eat UnrelEv_grocery
big 
dinners 
. 
next 
, 
i 
went ScrEv_move_section
to 
the 
ice 
cream 
aisle 
and 
picked+up ScrEv_get_groceries
my 
favorite 
rocky 
road 
ice 
cream 
for 
when 
i 
crave UnrelEv_grocery
sweets 
. 
overall 
it 
was UnrelEv_grocery
a 
good 
experience 
, 
everything 
cost ScrEv_pay
me 
about 
523 
but 
i 
got RelNScrEv_grocery
523 
percent 
off 
with UnrelEv_grocery
my 
discount 
card 
. 
<end_of_story>_grocery 
my 
fridge 
was RelNScrEv_grocery
completely 
empty 
, 
so 
i 
knew UnrelEv_grocery
i 
had 
to 
go UnrelEv_grocery
get+some+groceries Evoking_grocery
. 
i 
drove+over ScrEv_go_grocery
to 
the

and 
parked RelNScrEv_grocery
my

i 
grabbed ScrEv_take_shop_cart
a

cart 
from 
the 
front 
of 
the 
store 
and 
walked ScrEv_enter
through 
the 
big 
sliding UnrelEv_grocery
doors

it 
's UnrelEv_grocery
amazing 
how 
many 
kinds 
of 
food 
there 
are UnrelEv_grocery
to 
buy ScrEv_get_groceries

. 
luckily 
, 
i 
had 
made ScrEv_make_list

list 
before 
i 
left RelNScrEv_grocery

i 
knew UnrelEv_grocery

some 
of 
the 
best 
fruits 
and 
vegetables 
. 
i 
picked+up ScrEv_get_groceries
a 
gallon 
of 
milk 
from 
the 
dairy 
section 
. 
up 
ahead 
was RelNScrEv_grocery
the

down

began UnrelEv_grocery
walking+down ScrEv_move_section
the 
isles 
while 
i 
looked+at RelNScrEv_grocery
my 
shopping 
list 
. 
i 
usually 
write ScrEv_make_list

list 
when

go+to+the+store Evoking_grocery
to 
make+sure ScrEv_check_list
that 
i

once 
i 
got ScrEv_get_groceries
everything

list 
i 
took RelNScrEv_grocery

shopping 
cart 
and 
wheeled ScrEv_go_checkout

over 
to 
the 
line 
for 
the

<end_of_story>_grocery 
while 
preparing UnrelEv_grocery
a 
dinner 
of 
spaghetti 
and 
meatballs 
tonight 
, 
i 
realized UnrelEv_grocery
i 
needed 
to 
go+grocery+shopping Evoking_grocery
to 
restock RelNScrEv_grocery
my 
refrigerator 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_grocery
still 
early 
and 
the 
store 
wasn UnrelEv_grocery
' 
t 
close 
so 
i 
made ScrEv_go_grocery
a 
trip 
to 
the 
store 
. 
i 
grabbed ScrEv_take_shop_cart
a 
shopping 
cart 
because 
i 
' 
m+out RelNScrEv_grocery
of 
eggs 
, 
bread 
, 
orange 
juice 
, 
milk 
etc 
. 
i 
don 
' 
t 
like UnrelEv_grocery
can 
foods 
but 
i 
like UnrelEv_grocery
to 
keep UnrelEv_grocery
some 
stocked UnrelEv_grocery
in 
my 
cabinet 
just 
in 
case UnrelEv_grocery
. 
i 
needed RelNScrEv_grocery
corn 
, 
beets 
, 
soup 
etc. 
. 
i 
had 
to 
eat UnrelEv_grocery
bread 
ends 
because 
i 
was+out RelNScrEv_grocery
of 
whole 
wheat 
bread 
. 
the 
store 
wasn 
' 
t 
so 
crowded RelNScrEv_grocery
considering UnrelEv_grocery
it 
would 
be 
closing RelNScrEv_grocery
in 
an 
hour 
or 
so 
. 
i 
got ScrEv_wait
in 
the 
shortest 
line 
and 
of 
course 
the 
register 
broke+down RelNScrEv_grocery
. 
i 
waited ScrEv_wait
and 
waited ScrEv_wait
. 
i 
could 
have 
gotten+out RelNScrEv_grocery
of 
line 
but 
i 
didn UnrelEv_grocery
' 
t 
. 
when 
i 
finally 
got RelNScrEv_grocery
to 
the 
register 
, 
it 
was UnrelEv_grocery
time 
for 
my 
checker 
to 
leave RelNScrEv_grocery
. 
i 
had 
to 
wait ScrEv_wait
until 
an 
assistant 
manager 
signed+in RelNScrEv_grocery
the 
register 
to 
ring+up ScrEv_cashier_scan/weight
my 
purchases 
. 
the 
register 
was RelNScrEv_grocery
out 
of 
tape 
so 
i 
was 
delayed ScrEv_wait
again 
. 
i 
wished UnrelEv_grocery
i 
' 
d 
waited UnrelEv_grocery
until 
tomorrow 
. 
there 
were UnrelEv_grocery
no 
baggers 
to 
bag ScrEv_pack_groceries
my 
groceries 
so 
i 
did ScrEv_pack_groceries
it 
myself 
. 
my 
total 
came ScrEv_pay
to 
$ 
523 
and 
i 
only 
had UnrelEv_grocery
$ 
523 
cash 
on 
me 
. 
that 
' 
s UnrelEv_grocery
all 
i 
thought UnrelEv_grocery
i 
was 
going 
to 
spend ScrEv_pay
. 
i 
gave ScrEv_pay
the 
clerk 
a 
credit 
card 
which 
didn 
' 
t 
go+through RelNScrEv_grocery
and 
the 
people 
behind 
me 
started UnrelEv_grocery
blowing RelNScrEv_grocery
and 
hissing RelNScrEv_grocery
under 
their 
breath 
. 
i 
offered ScrEv_pay
another 
card 
. 
thank UnrelEv_grocery
god 
that 
one 
went+through RelNScrEv_grocery
. 
the 
employees 
had 
locked RelNScrEv_grocery
the 
door 
i 
' 
d 
plan UnrelEv_grocery
to 
exit+out ScrEv_leave
of 
. 
the 
manager 
came+over RelNScrEv_grocery
and 
let RelNScrEv_grocery
me 
out 
. 
my 
car 
was UnrelEv_grocery
the 
only 
car 
parked RelNScrEv_grocery
in 
the 
customer 
' 
s 
parking 
lot 
. 
i 
wished UnrelEv_grocery
i 
' 
d 
stayed UnrelEv_grocery
at 
home 
. 
<end_of_story>_grocery 
when 
i 
go+grocery+shopping Evoking_grocery
i 
almost 
always 
take ScrEv_make_list
a 
list 
. 
so 
for 
me 
, 
the 
first 
step 
to 
shopping ScrEv_get_groceries
is UnrelEv_grocery
list 
making ScrEv_make_list
. 
i 
list ScrEv_make_list
what 
i 
plan UnrelEv_grocery
to 
cook UnrelEv_grocery
this 
week 
, 
and 
also 
cleaning 
products 
and 
similar 
things 
. 
my 
favorite 
place 
to 
shop Evoking_grocery
is UnrelEv_grocery
a 
huge 
membership 
store 
, 
for 
its 
good 
prices 
. 
i 
pick+up ScrEv_take_shop_cart
a 
shopping 
cart 
just 
outside 
the 
store 
. 
then 
i 
enter ScrEv_enter
, 
sometimes 
showing RelNScrEv_grocery
my 
membership 
card 
to 
the 
person 
at 
the 
door 
and 
sometimes 
getting+in ScrEv_enter
without 
showing RelNScrEv_grocery
it 
. 
i 
cruise+past ScrEv_move_section
the 
impulse 
items 
just 
inside 
the 
door 
, 
and 
through 
the 
electronics 
and 
organic 
foods 
sections 
that 
come ScrEv_move_section
next 
. 
next 
come ScrEv_move_section
many 
aisles 
with 
items 
like 
light 
bulbs 
and 
pillows 
. 
finally 
i 
get+to ScrEv_move_section
the 
food 
. 
there 
are UnrelEv_grocery
usually 
people 
here 
offering RelNScrEv_grocery
samples 
of 
new 
food 
items 
. 
i 
often 
take RelNScrEv_grocery
some 
. 
i 
buy ScrEv_get_groceries
large 
packages 
of 
chicken 
or 
fish 
that 
can 
be 
frozen UnrelEv_grocery
. 
sometimes 
i 
buy ScrEv_get_groceries
fresh 
bread 
. 
i 
continue ScrEv_move_section
to 
the 
fresh 
fruit 
and 
vegetable 
section 
, 
where 
i 
try UnrelEv_grocery
to 
restrain RelNScrEv_grocery
myself 
to 
what 
i 
can 
use RelNScrEv_grocery
. 
next 
come ScrEv_move_section

goods 
. 
i 
get ScrEv_get_groceries
frozen

on 
the 
way 
back 
, 
and 
then

few 
canned UnrelEv_grocery
food 
and 
dry 
goods 
. 
the 
last 
areas 
are UnrelEv_grocery
pharmacy 
, 
which 
i 
mostly 
avoid UnrelEv_grocery
, 
and 
the 
book 
section 
, 
where 
i 
'm+apt UnrelEv_grocery
to 
linger RelNScrEv_grocery
. 
then 
i 
wait ScrEv_wait
in 
line 
for 
a 
while 
, 
pay ScrEv_pay

and 
leave ScrEv_leave

store 
. 
as 
i 
leave ScrEv_leave

someone 
checks RelNScrEv_grocery

twenty 
registers 
in 
the

. 
i 
chose RelNScrEv_grocery

i 
put ScrEv_put_conveyor
the

started UnrelEv_grocery
cruising ScrEv_move_section
the 
aisles 
of 
the 
store 
. 
i 
use RelNScrEv_grocery
a 
budget 
when 
i 
shop Evoking_grocery
so 
i 
add RelNScrEv_grocery
the 
prices 
of 
items 
in 
my 
head 
as 
i 
shop Evoking_grocery
. 
i 
picked+out ScrEv_get_groceries
the 
things 
on 
my 
list 
: 
milk 
, 
butter 
, 
bread 
, 
tuna 
fish 
, 
dog 
food 
, 
rice 
, 
maple 
syrup 
and 
paper 
cups 
. 
after 
i 
finished UnrelEv_grocery
making ScrEv_get_groceries
all 
my 
selections 
, 
i 
pushed ScrEv_go_checkout
my 
cart 
to 
the 
checkout 
line 
. 
when 
it 
was UnrelEv_grocery
my 
turn 
, 
i 
unloaded ScrEv_put_conveyor
all 
of 
my 
groceries 
onto 
the 
conveyor 
belt 
so 
that 
the 
cashier 
could 
ring ScrEv_cashier_scan/weight
them 
up 
. 
a 
bagger 
gently 
put ScrEv_pack_groceries
my 
items 
in 
paper 
bags 
. 
the 
cashier 
gave ScrEv_pay
me 
the 
total 
of 
my 
order 
and 
i 
paid ScrEv_pay
her 
. 
i 
thanked RelNScrEv_grocery
both 
her 
and 
the 
bagger 
for 
doing RelNScrEv_grocery
an 
excellent 
job 
. 
i 
pushed ScrEv_bring_vehicle
the 
cart 
to 
my 
car 
and 
unloaded ScrEv_bring_vehicle
the 
groceries 
. 
i 
put ScrEv_return_shop_cart
my 
cart 
back 
into 
the 
cart 
holder 
that 
was 
located UnrelEv_grocery
in 
the 
parking 
lot 
. 
once 
i 
got RelNScrEv_grocery
home 
, 
i 
brought RelNScrEv_grocery
the 
groceries 
in 
and 
put RelNScrEv_grocery
them 
away 
. 
it 
's UnrelEv_grocery
nice 
to 
have 
the 
house 
restocked RelNScrEv_grocery
with 
food 
just 
in 
time 
for 
the 
weekend 
. 
<end_of_story>_grocery 
weekly 
grocery+shopping Evoking_grocery
begins UnrelEv_grocery
at 
the 
local 
supermarket 
down 
the 
street 
. 
it 
's UnrelEv_grocery
the 
closest 
by 
with 
a 
great 
selection 
. 
it 
may 
not 
be UnrelEv_grocery
the 
cheapest 
but 
nothing 
compares UnrelEv_grocery
in 
how 
close 
it 
is UnrelEv_grocery
. 
once 
i 
am ScrEv_enter
at 
the 
store 
, 
i 
usually 
head ScrEv_move_section
straight 
to 
the 
fruits 
and 
vegetable 
sections 
first 
. 
i 
will 
grab ScrEv_get_groceries
all 
the 
fruits 
and 
veggies 
that 
i 
think UnrelEv_grocery
i 
will 
need RelNScrEv_grocery
for 
the 
week 
. 
i 
do 
n't 
really 
go RelNScrEv_grocery
with 
a 
shopping 
list 
or 
anything 
in 
mind 
. 
usually 
whatever 
looks RelNScrEv_grocery
the 
freshest 
or 
is RelNScrEv_grocery
on 
sale 
is UnrelEv_grocery
what 
i 
tend UnrelEv_grocery
to 
buy ScrEv_get_groceries
. 
after 
selecting ScrEv_get_groceries
these 
items 
, 
i 
will 
move ScrEv_move_section
to 
the 
proteins 
. 
sometimes 
it 
is UnrelEv_grocery
chicken 
and 
sometimes 
it UnrelEv_grocery
beef 
. 
it 
depends UnrelEv_grocery
on 
the 
vegetables 
i 
've 
just 
selected ScrEv_get_groceries
to 
determine UnrelEv_grocery
which 
type 
of 
protein 
i 
will 
be 
purchasing ScrEv_get_groceries
. 
lastly 
, 
once 
those 
are 
done ScrEv_get_groceries
i 
will 
pick+up ScrEv_get_groceries
the 
packaged UnrelEv_grocery
goods 
such 
as 
milk 
, 
bread 
, 
eggs 
, 
and 
cereal 
. 
i 
do 
n't 
each UnrelEv_grocery
much 
junk 
food 
or 
processed UnrelEv_grocery
foods 
so 
this 
is UnrelEv_grocery
basically 
all 
i 
will 
get ScrEv_get_groceries
for 
a 
typical 
trip 
to 
the 
grocery 
store 
. 
<end_of_story>_grocery 
i 
made ScrEv_make_list
a 
list 
of 
all 
the 
things 
we 
needed 
to 
buy ScrEv_get_receipt
beforehand 
. 
next 
to 
the 
name 
of 
each 
object 
, 
i 
added RelNScrEv_grocery
the 
last 
price 
i 
remembered UnrelEv_grocery
for 
it 
. 
then 
, 
i 
added+up RelNScrEv_grocery
all 
the 
prices 
to 
get RelNScrEv_grocery
a 
general 
range 
for 
our 
budget 
. 
i 
marked+off RelNScrEv_grocery
what 
items 
i 
could 
leave+behind RelNScrEv_grocery
if 
we 
were 
going 
to 
spend ScrEv_pay
too 
much 
money 
. 
i 
also 
added ScrEv_make_list
items 
we 
could 
add ScrEv_get_groceries
if 
we 
saved RelNScrEv_grocery
a 
lot 
of 
money 
. 
then 
, 
i 
made+sure UnrelEv_grocery
there 
was UnrelEv_grocery
plenty 
of 
room 
in 
the 
car 
to 
hold ScrEv_bring_vehicle
the 
groceries 
and 
put ScrEv_bring_vehicle
my 
reusable RelNScrEv_grocery
grocery 
bags 
in 
the 
trunk 
. 
the 
next 
day 
, 
i 
drove ScrEv_go_grocery
to 
the 
store 
and 
picked+up ScrEv_get_groceries
what 
items 
were UnrelEv_grocery
on 
my 
list 
and 
wrote+down ScrEv_check_off
what 
prices 
i 
actually 
paid ScrEv_pay
for 
them 
. 
since 
i 
had RelNScrEv_grocery
extra 
money 
, 
i 
also 
bought ScrEv_get_groceries
some 
ice 
cream 
. 
i 
headed ScrEv_go_checkout
to 
the 
check-out 
and 
placed ScrEv_put_conveyor
all 
my 
items 
gently 
on 
the 
conveyer 
belt 
. 
i 
said RelNScrEv_grocery
hi 
to 
the 
cashier 
, 
paid ScrEv_pay
her 
what 
i 
owed ScrEv_pay
, 
and 
took ScrEv_bring_vehicle
the 
groceries 
back 
to 
my 
car 
. 
i 
made+sure UnrelEv_grocery
to 
put ScrEv_return_shop_cart
the 
cart 
away 
, 
too 
. 
then 
, 
i 
drove ScrEv_leave
home 
and 
unloaded RelNScrEv_grocery
the 
groceries 
into 
their 
proper 
places 
. 
<end_of_story>_grocery 
every 
tuesday 
night 
i 
make UnrelEv_grocery
the 
same 
routine 
. 
i 
go+out UnrelEv_grocery
and 
buy+groceries Evoking_grocery
that 
night 
. 
however 
, 
this 
week 
was UnrelEv_grocery
different 
and 
i 
had UnrelEv_grocery
a 
party 
to 
prepare+for UnrelEv_grocery
the 
weekend 
to 
celebrate UnrelEv_grocery
a 
friend 
's 
birthday 
. 
i 
created ScrEv_make_list
a 
check 
list 
of 
all 
the 
things 
i 
needed RelNScrEv_grocery
earlier 
in 
the 
day 
, 
and 
headed+out ScrEv_go_grocery
to 
the 
store 
. 
on 
arrival 
i 
went+down ScrEv_move_section
each 
lane 
, 
and 
picked+out ScrEv_get_groceries
on 
what 
i 
needed RelNScrEv_grocery
exactly 
. 
this 
process 
can 
be UnrelEv_grocery
very 
boring 
so 
i 
kept UnrelEv_grocery
my 
mp3 
player 
along 
with 
me 
to 
play UnrelEv_grocery
music 
while 
i 
shop Evoking_grocery
. 
after 
about 
523 
minutes 
of 
looking+around ScrEv_move_section
, 
i 
finally 
had ScrEv_get_groceries
everything 
that 
i 
needed RelNScrEv_grocery
! 
i 
go ScrEv_go_checkout
to 
the 
cashier 
, 
and 
ended+up UnrelEv_grocery
picking+up ScrEv_get_groceries
a 
magazine 
on 
the 
way 
there 
. 
i 
paid ScrEv_pay
the 
cashier 
using ScrEv_pay
my 
credit 
card 
after 
watching UnrelEv_grocery
them 
scan ScrEv_cashier_scan/weight
and 
bag ScrEv_pack_groceries
my 
groceries 
. 
i 
brought ScrEv_bring_vehicle
the 
kart 
all 
the 
way 
to 
my 
car 
and 
packed ScrEv_bring_vehicle
everything 
in 
. 
i 
was 
finally 
done UnrelEv_grocery
! 
<end_of_story>_grocery 
my 
cupboard 
is UnrelEv_grocery
bare 
, 
so 
it 
is UnrelEv_grocery
time 
to 
go+grocery+shopping Evoking_grocery
. 
i 
do 
n't 
want 
to 
over-spend ScrEv_pay
, 
so 
i 
make+sure UnrelEv_grocery
to 
bring ScrEv_make_list
a 
grocery 
list 
. 
i 
usually 
have ScrEv_make_list
a 
list 
of 
items 
i 
will 
need RelNScrEv_grocery
as 
i 
run+out RelNScrEv_grocery
of 
them 
, 
i 
post ScrEv_make_list
them 
to 
the 
fridge 
. 
i 
grabbed RelNScrEv_grocery
my 
list 
and 
looked+around RelNScrEv_grocery
to 
see UnrelEv_grocery
if 
i 
need RelNScrEv_grocery
any 
additional 
items 
. 
i 
added ScrEv_make_list
any 
items 
and 
left RelNScrEv_grocery
my 
house 
. 
i 
got+into RelNScrEv_grocery
my 
car 
and 
drove ScrEv_go_grocery
to 
the 
nearest 
grocery 
store 
, 
my 
favorite 
one 
. 
with 
my 
list 
in 
hand 
, 
i 
start UnrelEv_grocery
shopping Evoking_grocery
. 
i 
went ScrEv_move_section
to 
the 
middle 
isles 
first 
, 
since 
i 
want 
to 
get ScrEv_get_groceries
my 
refrigerated UnrelEv_grocery
and 
frozen UnrelEv_grocery
items 
last 
, 
do 
n't 
want 
them 
getting UnrelEv_grocery
warm 
or 
thawing UnrelEv_grocery
before 
i 
even 
get RelNScrEv_grocery
them 
home 
. 
i 
chose ScrEv_go_checkout
the 
express 
lane 
since 
i 
was 
n't 
getting ScrEv_get_groceries
too 
many 
items 
. 
the 
cashier 
was RelNScrEv_grocery
courteous 
to 
me 
, 
as 
i 
was RelNScrEv_grocery
to 
her 
. 
i 
bought ScrEv_pay
my 
items 
and 
headed ScrEv_leave
home 
. 
<end_of_story>_grocery 
yesterday 
, 
i 
went ScrEv_go_grocery
to 
the 
grocery 
store 
to 
buy+food Evoking_grocery
. 
i 
went ScrEv_go_grocery
to 
my 
locally-owned UnrelEv_grocery
supermarket 
, 
bet-r 
, 
because 
i 
like UnrelEv_grocery
to 
support UnrelEv_grocery
small 
businesses 
. 
i 
go ScrEv_go_grocery
in 
the 
early 
afternoons 
when 
i 
can 
to 
avoid UnrelEv_grocery
the 
rush 
of 
people 
going ScrEv_go_grocery
after 
school 
or 
work 
-- 
that 
way 
i 
do 
n't 
have 
to 
wait ScrEv_wait
in 
long 
lines 
at 
checkout 
. 
i 
brought ScrEv_make_list
my 
shopping 
list 
with 
me 
: 
eggs 
, 
milk 
, 
bread 
, 
pasta 
, 
and 
other 
staples 
. 
i 
picked+up ScrEv_take_shop_cart
a 
handbasket 
as 
my 
list 
was UnrelEv_grocery
not 
large 
and 
began UnrelEv_grocery
to 
peruse ScrEv_move_section
the 
aisles 
. 
i 
picked+up ScrEv_get_groceries
everything 
on 
my 
list 
, 
except 
one 
thing 
. 
they 
were+out RelNScrEv_grocery
of 
my 
favorite 
variety 
of 
pasta 
sauce 
, 
so 
i 
bought ScrEv_get_groceries
a 
new 
kind 
to 
try UnrelEv_grocery
instead 
. 
i 
did 
not 
intend UnrelEv_grocery
to 
pick+up ScrEv_get_groceries
anything 
that 
was UnrelEv_grocery
not 
on 
my 
list 
, 
but 
i 
noticed UnrelEv_grocery
the 
pints 
of 
strawberries 
were RelNScrEv_grocery
very 
inexpensive 
and 
decided UnrelEv_grocery
to 
buy ScrEv_get_groceries
some 
as 
well 
. 
i 
was 
finished UnrelEv_grocery
in 
about 
523 
minutes 
and 
got ScrEv_go_checkout
in 
line 
for 
checkout 
. 
i 
paid ScrEv_pay
for 
my 
groceries 
and 
packed ScrEv_pack_groceries
them 
in 
the 
reusable UnrelEv_grocery
bag 
i 
had 
brought ScrEv_take_bags
along 
with 
me 
. 
then 
i 
returned ScrEv_leave
home 
. 
<end_of_story>_grocery 
when 
i 
go+grocery+shopping Evoking_grocery
it 
is UnrelEv_grocery
usually 
pretty 
hectic 
. 
right 
now 
i 
ca 
n't 
drive UnrelEv_grocery
, 
so 
i 
have 
to 
find UnrelEv_grocery
a 
ride 
there 
. 
i 
also 
have 
to 
make+sure UnrelEv_grocery
that 
i 
find UnrelEv_grocery
someone 
who 
has UnrelEv_grocery
a 
car 
that 
my 
two 
children 
will 
fit+in UnrelEv_grocery
as 
well 
. 
so 
, 
after 
finding UnrelEv_grocery
a 
way 
to 
get+there ScrEv_go_grocery
, 
i 
get UnrelEv_grocery
a 
cart 
wiped+down RelNScrEv_grocery
and 
put RelNScrEv_grocery
my 
youngest 
in 
the 
seat 
. 
of 
course 
, 
if 
there 
happens UnrelEv_grocery
to 
be UnrelEv_grocery
a 
car 
cart 
, 
we 
have 
to 
take ScrEv_take_shop_cart
that 
one 
so 
both 
kids 
can 
sit+inside RelNScrEv_grocery
. 
if 
i 
remembered UnrelEv_grocery
to 
bring ScrEv_make_list
my 
list 
, 
i 
get ScrEv_get_groceries
all 
of 
the 
stuff 
on 
it 
first 
. 
i 
always 
grab ScrEv_get_groceries
other 
things 
as 
i 
see UnrelEv_grocery
them 
and 
realize UnrelEv_grocery
i 
need RelNScrEv_grocery
them 
. 
it 
can 
be UnrelEv_grocery
a 
good 
thing 
, 
or 
a 
bad 
thing 
. 
we 
usually 
end+up ScrEv_get_groceries
with 
quite 
a 
bit 
more 
than 
i 
intended ScrEv_make_list
, 
but 
since 
i 
ca 
n't 
go ScrEv_go_grocery
to 
the 
store 
whenever 
i 
want UnrelEv_grocery
, 
i 
usually 
justify UnrelEv_grocery
it 
to 
myself 
. 
so 
, 
we 
get+into ScrEv_wait
the 
check 
out 
line 
and 
of 
course 
i 
have 
to 
tell RelNScrEv_grocery
my 
oldest 
child 
we 
ca 
n't 
get ScrEv_get_groceries
every 
candy 
he 
sees UnrelEv_grocery
in 
the 
aisle 
while 
we 
are 
waiting ScrEv_wait
. 
after 
we 
check+out ScrEv_pay
, 
we 
go+outside ScrEv_leave
and 
i 
get RelNScrEv_grocery
the 
kiddos 
in 
first 
. 
then 
to 
bring UnrelEv_grocery
our 
shopping 
trip 
to 
an 
end 
, 
i 
puzzle+piece ScrEv_bring_vehicle
everything 
into 
the 
back 
of 
our 
car 
and 
return ScrEv_return_shop_cart
the 
cart 
. 
<end_of_story>_grocery 
going+grocery+shopping Evoking_grocery
is UnrelEv_grocery
a 
routine 
task 
for 
most 
people 
. 
as 
most 
groceries 
nearby 
now 
require UnrelEv_grocery
the 
use 
of 
reusable UnrelEv_grocery
tote 
bags 
rather 
than 
offering RelNScrEv_grocery
paper 
or 
plastic 
bags 
, 
the 
trip 
usually 
begins UnrelEv_grocery
at 
home 
with 
remembering UnrelEv_grocery
to 
take+along ScrEv_take_bags
a 
tote 
or 
two 
. 
i 
begin UnrelEv_grocery
my 
trip 
by 
starting+down ScrEv_move_section
the 
aisle 
to 
either 
the 
far 
right 
or 
left 
and 
continuing ScrEv_move_section
from 
there 
. 
if 
the 
store 
offers RelNScrEv_grocery
an 
ad 
at 
the 
door 
i 
will 
usually 
pick RelNScrEv_grocery
one 
up 
and 
decide RelNScrEv_grocery
if 
there 
are UnrelEv_grocery
any 
deals 
i 
wish UnrelEv_grocery
to 
take Unclear_grocery
advantage 
of 
. 
keeping RelNScrEv_grocery
an 
eye 
on 
my 
spending ScrEv_pay
is UnrelEv_grocery
importnat 
, 
as 
grocery 
expenses 
can 
add+up ScrEv_pay
quickly 
. 
if 
i 
am 
doing+major+shopping Evoking_grocery
i 
will 
use ScrEv_take_shop_cart
a 
cart 
, 
but 
if 
i 
'm 
just 
stopping+for+a+few+items Evoking_grocery
, 
a 
hand 
basket 
will 
suffice RelNScrEv_grocery
. 
when 
paying ScrEv_pay
for 
my 
items 
i 
do UnrelEv_grocery
my 
best 
to 
find RelNScrEv_grocery
the 
shortest 
line 
with 
the 
fastest 
checker 
so 
i 
can 
be+in ScrEv_wait
and 
out 
as 
quickly 
as 
possible 
. 
<end_of_story>_grocery 
after 
breakfast 
i 
got UnrelEv_grocery
in 
my 
car 
and 
drove ScrEv_go_grocery
to 
the 
grocery 
store 
to 
buy+food Evoking_grocery
for 
the 
next 
several 
days 
. 
i 
like UnrelEv_grocery
to 
walk UnrelEv_grocery
so 
i 
parked RelNScrEv_grocery
in 
the 
back 
row 
of 
the 
parking 
lot 
. 
i 
walked ScrEv_enter
in 
the 
store

selected ScrEv_take_shop_cart
a 
shopping 
cart 
that 
did 
n't 
have 
stuck RelNScrEv_grocery
wheels 
. 
as 
i 
normally 
do UnrelEv_grocery
i 
first 
proceeded ScrEv_move_section
to 
the 
deli 
department 
and 
got RelNScrEv_grocery
a 
number 
. 
since 
there 
were UnrelEv_grocery
several 
people 
in 
front 
of 
me 
i 
started UnrelEv_grocery
my 
shopping Evoking_grocery
near 
the 
deli 
. 
i 
picked ScrEv_get_groceries
some 
fresh 
produce 
and 
vegetables 
until 
my 
number 
was 
called RelNScrEv_grocery
. 
at 
the 
deli 
i 
purchased ScrEv_get_groceries
ham 
, 
cheese

salami

i 
picked+up ScrEv_get_groceries
a 
whole 
chicken

the 
steak

selecting ScrEv_get_groceries
various

i 
picked+up ScrEv_get_groceries

<end_of_story>_grocery 
one 
day 
i 
noticed UnrelEv_grocery
that 
i 
was 
running+out RelNScrEv_grocery
of 
food 
and 
needed 
to 
go+grocery+shopping Evoking_grocery
. 
i 
drove+down ScrEv_go_grocery

and 
showed RelNScrEv_grocery
the

, 
got ScrEv_take_shop_cart

cart 
, 
and 
was UnrelEv_grocery
on 
my

to 
get ScrEv_get_groceries
my

. 
i 
went ScrEv_move_section
through

.

also 
stopped UnrelEv_grocery
along

way 
and 
tried RelNScrEv_grocery
some 
of 
the 
free 
samples 
they 
had UnrelEv_grocery
in 
the 
store 
. 
the 
ice 
cream

tried RelNScrEv_grocery
was UnrelEv_grocery
so 
good 
i 
ended+up UnrelEv_grocery
getting ScrEv_get_groceries
a 
box 
even 
though 
it 
was UnrelEv_grocery
not 
on 
my 
list 
. 
i 
guess UnrelEv_grocery
their 
sales 
pitch 
worked UnrelEv_grocery
. 
after 
i 
had RelNScrEv_grocery

then 
paid ScrEv_pay

woman 
and 
left ScrEv_leave
the

. 
on 
the 
way 
out 
i 
decided UnrelEv_grocery
to 
rent UnrelEv_grocery
a 
redbox 
movie 
for 
the 
night 
since 
the 
kiosk 
was UnrelEv_grocery
right

every 
sunday 
night 
, 
i 
make ScrEv_go_grocery
the 
weekly 
trip 
to 
the

. 
i 
usually 
do RelNScrEv_grocery
the 
majority 
of 
my 
grocery+shopping Evoking_grocery
at 
the 
local 
supermarket 
because 
the 
location 
is UnrelEv_grocery
convenient 
and 
the

are UnrelEv_grocery
good 
. 
before

kind 
of 
philosophy

saw UnrelEv_grocery
we 
could 
save RelNScrEv_grocery
a 
considerable 
amount 
of 
money 
by 
doing+more+grocery+shopping Evoking_grocery
. 
i 
set+up UnrelEv_grocery
our 
strategy 
to 
go ScrEv_go_grocery
every 
weekend 
and 
budget UnrelEv_grocery
about 
523 
dollars 
for 
the 
two 
of 
us 
each 
week 
. 
we 
like UnrelEv_grocery
to 
go ScrEv_go_grocery
to 
publix 
. 
we 
will 
start+off UnrelEv_grocery
buying ScrEv_get_groceries
produce 
, 
fruits 
and 
vegetables 
and 
such 
. 
then 
we 
move+over ScrEv_move_section
and 
look+for RelNScrEv_grocery
the 
best 
deals 
on 
meat 
. 
we 
usually 
get ScrEv_get_groceries

'll 
head ScrEv_move_section
over 
towards 
dairy 
and

. 
i 
like UnrelEv_grocery
to 
get ScrEv_get_groceries

get ScrEv_get_groceries
a

<end_of_story>_grocery 
as 
i 
was+about UnrelEv_grocery
to 
leave+for+the+grocery+store UnrelEv_grocery
, 
i 
reminded ScrEv_take_bags
myself 
not 
to 
forget UnrelEv_grocery
my 
reusable 
shopping 
bags 
. 
i 
am 
interested UnrelEv_grocery
in 
preserving 
our 
environment 
, 
so 
i 
avoid RelNScrEv_grocery
paper 
or 
plastic 
bags 
. 
my 
market 
is UnrelEv_grocery
just 
up 
the 
street 
, 
so 
i 
use UnrelEv_grocery
a 
hand 
trolley 
to 
bring RelNScrEv_grocery
everything 
home 
. 
i 
took UnrelEv_grocery
that 
from 
the 
closet 
, 
and 
headed ScrEv_go_grocery
out 
the 
door 
. 
the 
air 
was UnrelEv_grocery
fresh 
and 
i 
enjoyed UnrelEv_grocery
the 
walk 
. 
when 
i 
entered ScrEv_enter
the 
market 
, 
i 
chose ScrEv_take_shop_cart
a 
cart 
, 
and 
hung RelNScrEv_grocery
my 
hand 
trolley 
from 
the 
far 
end 
. 
taking ScrEv_move_section
each 
lane 
of 
the 
market 
one 
by 
one 
, 
i 
checked ScrEv_check_list
my 
list 
, 
and 
gathered ScrEv_get_groceries
the 
dry 
and 
canned 
goods 
i 
needed RelNScrEv_grocery
from 
the 
shelves 
. 
i 
even 
decided+on ScrEv_get_groceries
a 
few 
extras 
, 
as 
a 
treat 
. 
making ScrEv_move_section
a 
loop 
around 
the 
outer 
edges 
of 
the 
store 
, 
i 
visited ScrEv_move_section
the 
bakery 
, 
butcher 
, 
and 
deli 
as 
well 
. 
by 
now 
, 
the 
idea 
of 
getting UnrelEv_grocery
home 
, 
and 
making UnrelEv_grocery
lunch 
with 
some 
of 
the 
deli 
meat 
and 
cheese 
i 
had 
just 
chosen RelNScrEv_grocery
, 
seemed UnrelEv_grocery
like 
a 
lovely 
idea 
. 
i 
made ScrEv_go_checkout
my 
way 
to 
the 
cashier 
, 
and 
was UnrelEv_grocery
happy 
to 
see UnrelEv_grocery
the 
line 
was RelNScrEv_grocery
very 
short 
. 
as 
i 
waited ScrEv_wait
, 
i 
pulled RelNScrEv_grocery
the 
coupons 
from 
my 
wallet 
that 
applied UnrelEv_grocery
to 
my 
purchases 
, 
so 
i 
could 
give ScrEv_other_grocery
them 
to 
the 
cashier 
right 
off 
. 
as 
she 
ran ScrEv_cashier_scan/weight
my 
items 
across 
the 
scanner 
, 
i 
let RelNScrEv_grocery
her 
know UnrelEv_grocery
i 
had UnrelEv_grocery
my 
own 
bags 
, 
and 
proceeded UnrelEv_grocery
to 
bag ScrEv_pack_groceries
everything 
in 
an 
organized 
way 
, 
to 
hang ScrEv_pack_groceries
on 
my 
hand 
trolley 
. 
having 
finally 
paid ScrEv_pay
, 
i 
rolled+out ScrEv_leave
of 
the 
store 
with 
a 
smile 
and 
a 
wave 
. 
<end_of_story>_grocery 
on 
last 
sunday 
morning 
my 
wife 
woke UnrelEv_grocery
me 
up 
and 
told UnrelEv_grocery
me 
its 
523 
o'clock 
and 
time 
to 
to 
get+up UnrelEv_grocery
. 
but 
i 
was UnrelEv_grocery
very 
lazy 
on 
that 
day 
and 
i 
want UnrelEv_grocery
to 
spend UnrelEv_grocery
some 
more 
time 
on 
bed 
. 
i 
asked UnrelEv_grocery
my 
wife 
to 
get 
me 
some 
coffee 
. 
she 
brought UnrelEv_grocery
a 
very 
tasty 
hot 
coffee 
. 
its 
aroma 
is 
spreading UnrelEv_grocery
everywhere 
in 
my 
room 
. 
after 
having UnrelEv_grocery
the 
coffee 
i 
got+up UnrelEv_grocery
and 
took UnrelEv_grocery
a 
good 
shower 
. 
that 
time 
my 
wife 
prepared UnrelEv_grocery
breakfast 
for 
me 
. 
so 
i 
had UnrelEv_grocery
my 
breakfast 
and 
spent UnrelEv_grocery
some 
time 
for 
reading UnrelEv_grocery
news 
online 
. 
then 
my 
wife 
came UnrelEv_grocery
to 
me 
and 
asked UnrelEv_grocery
what 
is UnrelEv_grocery
my 
plan 
for 
our 
son 
's 
birthday 
. 
i 
told UnrelEv_grocery
her 
, 
'' 
`` 
oh 
! 
i 
forgot UnrelEv_grocery
. 
we 
have 
to 
plan UnrelEv_grocery
something 
. 
that 
is UnrelEv_grocery
on 
next 
saturday 
'' 
'' 
. 
at 
last 
i 
reached UnrelEv_grocery
a 
conclusion 
that 
this 
time 
i 
cook UnrelEv_grocery
food 
by 
myself 
. 
so 
we 
need 
to 
make ScrEv_make_list
a 
list 
for 
groceries 
for 
that 
. 
my 
wife 
helped UnrelEv_grocery
me 
to 
prepare ScrEv_make_list
a 
list 
. 
these 
days 
groceries 
are RelNScrEv_grocery
very 
pricey 
. 
so 
i 
checked ScrEv_other_grocery
the 
deals 
online 
. 
at 
last 
i 
found RelNScrEv_grocery
good 
deals 
in 
a 
grocery 
shop 
near 
my 
house 
. 
so 
me

there 
were UnrelEv_grocery
n't

around 
thanks

basket 
and 
proceeded ScrEv_move_section

section 
first 
for

the 
basket 
was 
starting UnrelEv_grocery

and 
heavy 
but 
i 
only 
had UnrelEv_grocery
two 
more

the 
store 
being UnrelEv_grocery
not 
very 
busy 
the

up

paid ScrEv_pay
for 
the 
groceries 
as 
a 
boy 
bagged ScrEv_pack_groceries
everything 
. 
another 
saturday 
's 
chore 
was 
done UnrelEv_grocery
! 
<end_of_story>_grocery 
the 
other 
day 
i 
went+to+the+grocery+store Evoking_grocery
to 
buy RelNScrEv_grocery
enough 
food 
for 
me 
to 
eat UnrelEv_grocery
for 
several 
days 
. 
before 
i 
left UnrelEv_grocery
, 
i 
thought UnrelEv_grocery
about 
what 
i 
might 
want UnrelEv_grocery
to 
eat UnrelEv_grocery
over 
the 
next 
few 
days 
. 
i 
looked+through UnrelEv_grocery
my 
recipes 
and 
decided+on RelNScrEv_grocery
what 
sort 
of 
food 
to 
buy RelNScrEv_grocery
. 
i 
got UnrelEv_grocery
a 
piece 
of 
paper 
and 
a 
pencil 
and 
wrote+down ScrEv_make_list
all 
the 
food 
that 
i 
would 
need RelNScrEv_grocery
to 
buy RelNScrEv_grocery
to 
make UnrelEv_grocery
these 
meals 
. 
once 
i 
felt UnrelEv_grocery
my 
list 
was UnrelEv_grocery
complete 
, 
i 
gathered ScrEv_take_bags
some 
bags 
and 
drove ScrEv_go_grocery
to 
the 
store 
. 
i 
took ScrEv_take_shop_cart
a 
shopping 
cart 
and 
pushed ScrEv_enter
it 
into 
the 
store 
. 
in 
the 
store 
, 
i 
looked ScrEv_check_list
at 
my 
list 
again 
and 
thought UnrelEv_grocery
about 
what 
foods 
might 
be UnrelEv_grocery
near 
the 
front 
of 
the 
store 
. 
the 
front 
of 
the 
store 
had RelNScrEv_grocery
fruits 
and 
vegetables 
, 
so 
i 
looked+for RelNScrEv_grocery
fruits 
and 
vegetables 
on 
my 
list 
so 
i 
could 
pick ScrEv_get_groceries
them 
up 
together 
. 
i 
walked ScrEv_move_section
down 
the 
aisle 
and 
found ScrEv_get_groceries
the 
items 
on 
my 
list 
and 
put ScrEv_get_groceries
them 
in 
my 
shopping 
cart 
. 
i 
put ScrEv_check_off
a 
check 
mark 
next 
to 
each 
item 
after 
i 
found ScrEv_get_groceries
it 
. 
when 
i 
got ScrEv_move_section
to 
the 
next 
aisle 
, 
i 
looked UnrelEv_grocery
at 
my 
list 
again 
and 
did UnrelEv_grocery
the 
same 
thing 
. 
i 
thought UnrelEv_grocery
about 
the 
foods 
that 
would 
be UnrelEv_grocery
in 
this 
aisle 
and 
found ScrEv_get_groceries
them 
together 
. 
after 
going+down ScrEv_move_section
all 
the 
aisles 
, 
i 
saw UnrelEv_grocery

item 
on 
my 
list

mark 
, 
so 
i 
knew UnrelEv_grocery
i 
was 
done UnrelEv_grocery
shopping RelNScrEv_grocery
. 
i 
pushed ScrEv_go_checkout
my 
shopping 
cart 
to 
the 
checkout 
lane 
and 
gave ScrEv_other_grocery
each 
item 
to 
the 
cashier 
. 
he 
scanned ScrEv_cashier_scan/weight
them 
and 
told UnrelEv_grocery
me 
how 
much 
money 
the 
food 
costs RelNScrEv_grocery
. 
i 
gave ScrEv_pay
him 
enough 
money 
to 
pay ScrEv_pay
for 
the 
food 
and 
then 
helped UnrelEv_grocery
him 
put ScrEv_pack_groceries
everything 
into 
my 
bags 
. 
then 
i 
carried ScrEv_bring_vehicle
the 
bags 
to 
my 
car 
and 
drove UnrelEv_grocery
home 
. 
i 
spent UnrelEv_grocery
the 
next 
few 
minutes 
putting RelNScrEv_grocery
all 
the 
food 
away 
where 
it 
belongs UnrelEv_grocery
,

getting RelNScrEv_grocery

when

a

something 
at

this 
makes 
me

there

in 
my 
cabinets 
and 
fridge 
for 
something 
to 
fix UnrelEv_grocery
for 
my 
families 
supper 
i 
realized UnrelEv_grocery
that 
a+trip+to+get+groceries+was+very+much+needed Evoking_grocery
as 
i 
was UnrelEv_grocery
low 
on 
food 
supplies 
. 
i 
grabbed RelNScrEv_grocery
a 
pen 
and 
paoper 
and 
made ScrEv_make_list
me 
a 
list 
of 
all 
that 
was 
needed RelNScrEv_grocery
. 
i 
then 
got 
dressed UnrelEv_grocery
and 
ready 
. 
i 
inspected UnrelEv_grocery
my 
handgun 
to 
make UnrelEv_grocery
sure 
it 
was 
cocked UnrelEv_grocery
, 
locked UnrelEv_grocery
and 
loaded UnrelEv_grocery
and 
placed UnrelEv_grocery
it 
securely 
on

right 
hip

i 
then 
made UnrelEv_grocery
sure 
i 
had UnrelEv_grocery
a 
extra 
magazine 
of 
ammunition 
in 
my 
left 
hand 
pant 
pocket

all 
that 
being UnrelEv_grocery
good 
i 
got RelNScrEv_grocery
in 
the 
car 
and 
off 
to 
the 
store 
i 
went ScrEv_go_grocery
. 
i 
always 
start UnrelEv_grocery
by 
getting ScrEv_get_groceries
the 
dry 
and 
canned UnrelEv_grocery
goods 
first 
so 
that 
my 
perishables 
will 
stay RelNScrEv_grocery
fresh 
until 
i 
get ScrEv_get_groceries
them 
home

so 
many 
canned UnrelEv_grocery
items 
, 
dry 
items 
, 
then 
meats 
and 
ice 
cream 
and 
frozen UnrelEv_grocery

however 
, 
when 
i 
opened UnrelEv_grocery
the

i 
saw UnrelEv_grocery
that 
there 
was UnrelEv_grocery
nothing 
in 
it 
besides 
a 
gallon 
of 
water 
and 
a 
half-used 
bottle 
of 
ketchup 
. 
i 
opened UnrelEv_grocery
my 
freezer 
to 
only 
find UnrelEv_grocery
two 
trays 
of 
ice

this 
did 
not

since

was UnrelEv_grocery

go+grocery+shopping Evoking_grocery

i 
went UnrelEv_grocery

picked+up ScrEv_get_groceries
some

and 
milk 
. 
my 
next

was UnrelEv_grocery

i 
tossed ScrEv_get_groceries

know+had UnrelEv_grocery
a

assortment 
of

it 
would 
be UnrelEv_grocery
a

would 
come UnrelEv_grocery
home

was UnrelEv_grocery
a

i 
checked ScrEv_check_list

i 
exited RelNScrEv_grocery
my 
car 
and 
locked RelNScrEv_grocery
it 
. 
i 
walked ScrEv_enter
to 
the 
entrance 
and 
grabbed ScrEv_take_shop_cart
a 
shopping 
cart 
. 
i 
pushed ScrEv_move_section
the 
shopping 
cart 
into 
the 
store 
and 
began UnrelEv_grocery
to 
search ScrEv_move_section
for 
the 
items 
on 
my 
list 
. 
i 
walked+through ScrEv_move_section
each 
isle 
. 
i 
gathered ScrEv_get_groceries
all 
the 
items 
from 
my 
grocery 
list 
. 
when 
i 
was 
finished UnrelEv_grocery
, 
i 
pushed ScrEv_move_section
my 
cart 
to 
the 
cashier 
to 
pay ScrEv_pay
for 
my 
groceries 
. 
i 
placed ScrEv_put_conveyor
the 
items 
in 
front 
of 
the 
cashier 
so 
that 
he 
could 
account ScrEv_cashier_scan/weight
for 
my 
purchases 
. 
he 
tallied ScrEv_cashier_scan/weight
my 
total 
. 
i 
paid ScrEv_pay
the 
total 
amount 
for 
the 
groceries 
and 
he 
gave ScrEv_pay
me 
my 
change 
back 
. 
finally 
, 
i 
left ScrEv_leave
the 
grocery 
store 
. 
i 
enjoy UnrelEv_grocery
grocery+shopping Evoking_grocery
. 
<end_of_story>_grocery 
all 
week 
long 
my 
family 
had 
been 
adding ScrEv_make_list
to 
a 
list 
on 
our 
refrigerator 
. 
sometimes 
they 
wrote+down ScrEv_make_list
what 
food 
they 
wanted UnrelEv_grocery
, 
and 
sometimes 
it 
was 
food 
we 
had 
run+out UnrelEv_grocery
of 
. 
today 
was 
saturday 
, 
the 
day 
i 
always 
go+grocery+shopping Evoking_grocery
. 
after 
putting RelNScrEv_grocery
the 
list 
and 
a 
pen 
in 
my 
pocket 
, 
i 
drove ScrEv_go_grocery
to 
the 
store 
and 
parked RelNScrEv_grocery
next 
to 
a 
light 
so 
that 
i 
would 
be 
able 
to 
find UnrelEv_grocery
it 
later 
. 
on 
my 
way 
into 
the 
store 
i 
took ScrEv_take_shop_cart
a 
shopping 
cart 
, 
because 
the 
list 
was UnrelEv_grocery
very 
long 
! 
the 
produce 
section 
is UnrelEv_grocery
by 
the 
door 
, 
and 
i 
piled ScrEv_get_groceries
broccoli 
, 
apples 
, 
oranges 
, 
and 
carrots 
into 
individual 
plastic 
bags 
, 
using ScrEv_pack_groceries
wire 
ties 
to 
keep UnrelEv_grocery
the 
bags 
closed ScrEv_pack_groceries
. 
then 
i 
pushed ScrEv_move_section
my 
cart 
up 
and 
down 
the 
aisles 
, 
adding ScrEv_get_groceries
kix 
cereal 
, 
pop 
tarts 
, 
cans 
of 
soup 
, 
crackers 
, 
bread 
and 
cookies 
to 
the 
cart 
. 
last 
was UnrelEv_grocery
the 
refrigerated 
section 
, 
where 
i 
picked+up ScrEv_get_groceries
milk 
and 
eggs 
. 
as 
i 
went ScrEv_move_section
, 
i 
crossed ScrEv_check_off
items 
off 
the 
list 
. 
when 
everything 
was 
crossed ScrEv_check_off
off 
i 
waited ScrEv_wait
in 
a 
line 
until 
a 
cashier 
rang+up ScrEv_cashier_scan/weight
my 
items 
and 
put ScrEv_pack_groceries
them 
in 
bags 
. 
after 
paying ScrEv_pay
, 
i 
put ScrEv_bring_vehicle
all 
the 
bags 
into 
the 
back 
of 
my 
car 
and 
went ScrEv_leave
home 
. 
<end_of_story>_grocery 
after 
looking UnrelEv_grocery
in 
the 
fridge 
, 
i 
realized UnrelEv_grocery
i 
had 
to 
go+buy+some+food Evoking_grocery
. 
there 
were UnrelEv_grocery
essential 
things 
i 
needed RelNScrEv_grocery
, 
like 
milk 
, 
eggs 
, 
flour 
, 
sugar 
, 
butter 
, 
fruits 
, 
and 
vegetables 
. 
i 
usually 
shop ScrEv_get_groceries
at 
a 
discount 
store 
that 
has RelNScrEv_grocery
really 
good 
deals 
on 
certain 
items 
. 
towards 
the 
end 
of 
the 
month 
, 
they 
hold RelNScrEv_grocery
a 
wine 
sale 
where 
all 
bottles 
are RelNScrEv_grocery
twenty 
percent 
off 
. 
i 
usually 
purchase ScrEv_get_groceries
my 
wine 
for 
the 
month 
during 
that 
time 
. 
wine 
was RelNScrEv_grocery
on 
my 
list 
for 
today 
as 
well 
. 
my 
pantry 
had RelNScrEv_grocery
a 
lot 
of 
dry 
goods 
, 
so 
i 
had UnrelEv_grocery
little 
intention 
of 
purchasing ScrEv_get_groceries
products 
in 
that 
category 
. 
my 
deep 
freezer 
was 
running UnrelEv_grocery
low 
, 
so 
one 
of 
the 
things 
i 
kept UnrelEv_grocery
an 
eye 
out 
for 
was 
meat 
that 
was RelNScrEv_grocery
on 
sale 
. 
i 
was 
able 
to 
find ScrEv_get_groceries
hams 
at 
severely 
discounted RelNScrEv_grocery
price 
! 
after 
grabbing ScrEv_get_groceries
four 
bottles 
of 
wine 
with 
the 
rest 
of 
my 
groceries 
, 
i 
went ScrEv_go_checkout
to 
the 
cashier 
, 
checked+out ScrEv_pay
, 
and 
drove ScrEv_leave
home 
to 
put RelNScrEv_grocery
all 
the 
food 
away 
. 
<end_of_story>_grocery 
we 
began UnrelEv_grocery
by 
driving ScrEv_go_grocery
past 
the 
overloaded UnrelEv_grocery
parking 
lot 
dreading UnrelEv_grocery
finding RelNScrEv_grocery
a 
parking 
spot 
. 
luckily 
we 
know UnrelEv_grocery
of 
a 
spot 
on 
the 
side 
of 
the 
grocery+store Evoking_grocery
that 
is UnrelEv_grocery
almost 
always 
vacant 
. 
my 
girlfriend 
and 
i 
park RelNScrEv_grocery
in 
our 
normal 
spot 
and 
walk ScrEv_enter
inside 
. 
the 
store 
is 
booming RelNScrEv_grocery
with 
people 
and 
all 
the 
lines 
are RelNScrEv_grocery
full 
. 
we 
are UnrelEv_grocery
the 
type 
of 
people 
who 
do 
not 
like UnrelEv_grocery
a 
lot 
of 
people 
so 
we 
wanted UnrelEv_grocery
to 
get+in ScrEv_enter
and 
out 
as 
fast 
as 
we 
could 
. 
quickly 
we 
get ScrEv_get_groceries
all 
the 
groceries 
marked+down RelNScrEv_grocery
on 
the 
list 
and 
we 
head ScrEv_go_checkout
to 
the 
checkout 
line 
. 
we 
found UnrelEv_grocery
a 
shorter 
line 
that 
was UnrelEv_grocery
for 
a 
lesser 
amount 
of 
groceries 
. 
luckily 
we 
had ScrEv_get_groceries
523 
items 
less 
than 
the 
maximum 
for 
the 
line 
, 
so 
we 
hopped+in ScrEv_go_checkout
and 
quickly 
got 
checked+out ScrEv_pay
and 
on 
our 
way 
. 
i 
carried ScrEv_bring_vehicle
the 
groceries 
out 
to 
the 
car 
rather 
than 
having 
the 
employees 
do ScrEv_bring_vehicle
it 
because 
there 
are UnrelEv_grocery
much 
less 
able 
people 
who 
need UnrelEv_grocery
there 
help 
more 
than 
i 
do UnrelEv_grocery
. 
finally 
we 
headed ScrEv_leave
home 
and 
used UnrelEv_grocery
our 
groceries 
to 
cook UnrelEv_grocery
dinner 
. 
<end_of_story>_grocery 
on 
friday 
, 
i 
decided UnrelEv_grocery
to 
go+grocery+shopping Evoking_grocery
. 
my 
mother 
made ScrEv_make_list
a 
list 
of 
all 
the 
items 
we 
needed RelNScrEv_grocery
and 
i 
went ScrEv_go_grocery
to 
go ScrEv_go_grocery
buy ScrEv_get_groceries
them 
. 
while 
i 
was UnrelEv_grocery
at 
the 
grocery 
store 
, 
i 
looked ScrEv_check_list
for 
everything 
on 
the 
list 
. 
some 
of 
them 
were UnrelEv_grocery
hard 
to 
find ScrEv_get_groceries
, 
so 
i 
had 
to 
ask RelNScrEv_grocery
a 
worker 
where 
to 
find ScrEv_get_groceries
them 
. 
they 
were UnrelEv_grocery
very 
helpful 
and 
pointed RelNScrEv_grocery
where 
to 
go ScrEv_move_section
. 
some 
of 
the 
items 
were UnrelEv_grocery
not 
available 
so 
i 
had 
to 
get RelNScrEv_grocery
a 
raincheck 
. 
after 
i 
got ScrEv_get_groceries
all 
the 
available 
items 
, 
i 
had 
to 
stand ScrEv_wait
on 
line 
at 
the 
checkout 
. 
the 
line 
was UnrelEv_grocery
very 
long 
and 
there 
were 
no 
other 
checkout 
lines 
open RelNScrEv_grocery
. 
it 
was 
frustrating UnrelEv_grocery
because 
i 
did 
not 
have 
that 
much 
items 
to 
buy ScrEv_get_groceries
. 
meanwhile 
, 
there 
were ScrEv_wait
at 
least 
four 
people 
ahead 
of 
me 
with 
a 
lot 
of 
items 
to 
buy ScrEv_get_groceries
. 
i 
am UnrelEv_grocery
very 
impatient 
. 
fortunately 
, 
one 
person 
ahead 
of 
me 
was UnrelEv_grocery
kind 
enough 
to 
let 
me 
skip RelNScrEv_grocery
him 
. 
i 
was UnrelEv_grocery
very 
appreciative 
. 
finally 
, 
i 
left ScrEv_leave
the 
grocery 
store 
with 
my 
items 
. 
<end_of_story>_grocery 
last 
weekend 
, 
i 
got RelNScrEv_grocery
into 
my 
car 
to 
head+to+the+grocery+store Evoking_grocery
. 
the 
store 
i 
normally 
go ScrEv_go_grocery
grocery 
shop ScrEv_get_groceries
at 
is 
safeway 
, 
with 
the 
exception 
of 
the 
few 
times 
i 
go ScrEv_go_grocery
to 
savemart 
. 
but 
for 
this 
time 
, 
i 
headed ScrEv_go_grocery
to 
safeway 
. 
i 
grabbed ScrEv_take_shop_cart
a 
shopping 
cart 
and 
immediately 
went ScrEv_move_section
to 
the 
left 
of 
the 
store 
like 
i 
normally 
do UnrelEv_grocery
. 
i 
grabbed ScrEv_get_groceries
the 
bread 
items 
i 
needed RelNScrEv_grocery
along 
with 
any 
breakfast 
pastries 
i 
enjoy UnrelEv_grocery
buying ScrEv_get_groceries
. 
like 
normal 
, 
i 
skip ScrEv_move_section
the 
first 
four 
aisles 
due 
to 
them 
being UnrelEv_grocery
for 
personal 
care 
and 
pet 
care 
. 
i 
buy RelNScrEv_grocery
my 
personal 
items 
elsewhere 
-lrb- 
such 
as 
shampoo 
, 
etc. 
-rrb- 
. 
i 
then 
went+down ScrEv_move_section
the 
beverage 
aisle 
where 
i 
picked+up ScrEv_get_groceries
several 
gatorades 
and 
bottled 
waters 
. 
i 
then 
continue UnrelEv_grocery
going+up ScrEv_move_section
each 
aisle 
after 
the 
beverage 
one 
, 
where 
i 
would 
pick+up ScrEv_get_groceries
my 
frozen 
foods 
, 
canned 
foods 
, 
snacks 
-lrb- 
such 
as 
chips 
and 
cookies 
-rrb- 
, 
and 
any 
other 
lunch 
items 
-lrb- 
frozen 
or 
non-frozen 
-rrb- 
. 
i 
then 
ended ScrEv_move_section
with 
the 
fruits 
and 
vegetables 
, 
where 
i 
picked+up ScrEv_get_groceries
a 
bunch 
of 
bananas 
and 
about 
four 
apples 
. 
i 
took ScrEv_go_checkout
my 
cart 
to 
the 
lone 
open 
register 
after 
waiting ScrEv_wait
for 
about 
five 
minutes 
. 
after 
purchasing ScrEv_pay
my 
items 
, 
i 
went+out ScrEv_leave
to 
my 
car 
and 
packed ScrEv_bring_vehicle
my 
groceries 
into 
the 
trunk 
. 
<end_of_story>_grocery 
i 
go+grocery+shopping Evoking_grocery
every 
week 
to 
get ScrEv_get_groceries
food 
and 
any 
other 
items 
that 
my 
husband 
and 
i 
need RelNScrEv_grocery
for 
the 
week 
. 
i 
wait UnrelEv_grocery
to 
go ScrEv_go_grocery
shopping ScrEv_get_groceries
usually 
until 
thursday 
or 
friday 
so 
that 
i 
can 
use RelNScrEv_grocery
the 
weekly 
ads 
to 
make ScrEv_make_list
my 
list 
. 
i 
shop ScrEv_get_groceries
for 
items 
on 
sale 
, 
so 
i 
like UnrelEv_grocery
to 
be 
very 
prepared UnrelEv_grocery
. 
i 
also 
use RelNScrEv_grocery
the 
store 
's 
apps 
on 
my 
phone 
to 
track RelNScrEv_grocery
what 
deals 
they 
are 
offering RelNScrEv_grocery
for 
me 
this 
week 
. 
i 
plan+out ScrEv_make_list
my 
list 
based UnrelEv_grocery
on 
the 
ads 
and 
the 
apps 
, 
and 
write ScrEv_make_list
each 
store 
's 
name 
above 
the 
items 
i 
want 
to 
buy ScrEv_get_groceries
there 
. 
on 
the 
day 
i 
decide UnrelEv_grocery
to 
go ScrEv_go_grocery
, 
i 
drive ScrEv_go_grocery
to 
the 
first 
store 
which 
is UnrelEv_grocery
whichever 
one 
i 
am 
getting ScrEv_get_groceries
less 
more 
cold 
things 
at 
. 
this 
way 
, 
they 
will 
stay RelNScrEv_grocery
colder 
together 
than 
if 
i 
buy ScrEv_get_groceries
one 
cold 
thing 
and 
it 
's 
sitting RelNScrEv_grocery
by 
itself 
in 
the 
heat 
of 
the 
car 
while 
i 
shop ScrEv_get_groceries
at 
the 
next 
store 
. 
i 
park RelNScrEv_grocery
my 
car 
as 
close 
as 
i 
can 
to 
the 
entrance 
and 
grab ScrEv_take_shop_cart
a 
cart 
. 
i 
begin UnrelEv_grocery
by 
opening ScrEv_check_list
my 
list 
and 
deciding UnrelEv_grocery
which 
part 
of 
the 
store 
i 
am 
going 
to 
start UnrelEv_grocery
in 
, 
and 
then 
work ScrEv_move_section
my 
way 
to 
the 
other 
end 
as 
i 
get ScrEv_get_groceries
the 
items 
that 
i 
need RelNScrEv_grocery
. 
i 
try UnrelEv_grocery
to 
go ScrEv_move_section
quickly 
so 
it 
does 
n't 
take UnrelEv_grocery
much 
time 
. 
when 
i 
'm 
ready 
, 
i 
go ScrEv_move_section
to 
the 
front 
of 
the 
store 
and 
get ScrEv_move_section
into 
a 
line 
with 
a 
number 
that 
is 
lit 
up 
. 
if 
i 
have ScrEv_get_groceries
less 
than 
523 
or 
523 
items 
, 
i 
will 
sometimes 
go ScrEv_move_section
to 
the 
express 
lane 
. 
i 
wait ScrEv_wait
for 
it 
to 
be UnrelEv_grocery
my 
turn 
and 
unload ScrEv_put_conveyor
the 
groceries 
onto 
the 
conveyor 
belt 
. 
after 
the 
cashier 
rings+up ScrEv_cashier_scan/weight
my 
items 
, 
i 
will 
pay ScrEv_pay
with 
either 
cash 
or 
my 
credit 
card 
. 
the 
items 
get 
bagged+up ScrEv_pack_groceries
and 
placed ScrEv_bring_vehicle
into 
my 
cart 
for 
me 
. 
i 
thank RelNScrEv_grocery
the 
cashier 
and 
take ScrEv_bring_vehicle
the 
cart 
to 
where 
my 
car 
is 
parked RelNScrEv_grocery
and 
put ScrEv_bring_vehicle
the 
groceries 
inside 
it 
. 
i 
then 
go ScrEv_go_grocery
to 
the 
next 
store 
and 
get ScrEv_get_groceries
any 
items 
i 
need RelNScrEv_grocery
there 
. 
i 
drive ScrEv_leave
home 
and 
bring RelNScrEv_grocery
all 
the 
groceries 
inside 
my 
house 
, 
and 
then 
put UnrelEv_grocery
them 
all 
away 
wherever 
they 
go UnrelEv_grocery
. 
<end_of_story>_grocery 
i 
needed RelNScrEv_grocery
to 
go+on+my+weekly+grocery+shopping+trip Evoking_grocery
last 
weekend 
. 
so 
, 
i 
went UnrelEv_grocery
to 
my 
fridge 
and 
started UnrelEv_grocery
to 
make ScrEv_make_list
a 
list 
of 
the 
cold 
items 
that 
i 
would 
need UnrelEv_grocery
. 
then 
, 
i 
checked+out RelNScrEv_grocery
my 
cabinet 
to 
be UnrelEv_grocery
sure 
that 
i 
picked+up ScrEv_get_groceries
a 
few 
canned UnrelEv_grocery
goods 
that 
i 
needed RelNScrEv_grocery
as 
well 
. 
i 
checked RelNScrEv_grocery
through 
my 
coupons 
and 
took RelNScrEv_grocery
the 
ones 
that 
i 
needed RelNScrEv_grocery
. 
i 
grabbed RelNScrEv_grocery
my 
wallet 
, 
helmet 
, 
sunglasses 
, 
and 
my 
insulated UnrelEv_grocery
backpack 
and 
went+outside ScrEv_go_grocery
to 
get+on ScrEv_go_grocery
my 
bike 
. 
after 
going+through ScrEv_go_grocery
traffic 
, 
i 
arrived ScrEv_go_grocery
at 
the 
store 
and 
parked RelNScrEv_grocery
my 
bike 
. 
i 
went ScrEv_enter
into 
the 
store 
and 
grabbed ScrEv_take_shop_cart
one 
of 
the 
smaller 
carts 
, 
since 
i 
would 
not 
need RelNScrEv_grocery
to 
get ScrEv_get_groceries
too 
many 
things 
this 
trip 
. 
i 
put RelNScrEv_grocery
my 
backpack 
and 
helmet 
in 
the 
cart 
and 
went+inside ScrEv_enter
. 
i 
just 
needed RelNScrEv_grocery
some 
cream 
, 
milk 
, 
eggs 
, 
sausage 
, 
cheese 
, 
and 
some 
veggies 
. 
i 
dodged+around ScrEv_move_section
other 
shoppers 
and 
headed ScrEv_move_section
towards 
the 
veggies 
. 
salad 
blends 
were RelNScrEv_grocery
on 
sale 
, 
so 
i 
picked ScrEv_get_groceries
some 
up 
. 
i 
also 
grabbed ScrEv_get_groceries
a 
nice 
head 
of 
broccoli 
as 
well 
. 
then 
i 
went ScrEv_move_section
to 
the 
refrigerated 
section 
and 
selected ScrEv_get_groceries
my 
meats 
and 
things 
, 
being UnrelEv_grocery
sure 
to 
check RelNScrEv_grocery
for 
discounted RelNScrEv_grocery
meats 
. 
my 
list 
was 
all 
checked+off ScrEv_check_off
so 
i 
went ScrEv_go_checkout
to 
the 
self-checkout 
to 
pay ScrEv_pay
. 
i 
scanned ScrEv_cashier_scan/weight
my 
items 
, 
ran RelNScrEv_grocery
my 
coupons 
, 
and 
paid ScrEv_pay
. 
i 
loaded ScrEv_pack_groceries
my 
items 
into 
my 
backpack 
and 
put UnrelEv_grocery
both 
it 
and 
my 
helmet 
on 
and 
left ScrEv_leave
the 
store 
. 
<end_of_story>_grocery 
when 
i 
was UnrelEv_grocery
a 
young 
boy 
, 
my 
mother 
would 
always 
take ScrEv_go_grocery
me 
grocery+shopping Evoking_grocery
with 
her 
. 
to 
me 
, 
i 
thought UnrelEv_grocery
i 
was 
just 
playing UnrelEv_grocery
around 
with 
the 
grocery 
items 
that 
they 
bought ScrEv_get_groceries
and 
handed UnrelEv_grocery
to 
me 
to 
put ScrEv_get_groceries
in 
the 
shopping 
cart 
. 
to 
this 
day 
she 
always 
tells UnrelEv_grocery
me 
how 
helpful 
i 
was UnrelEv_grocery
to 
organize RelNScrEv_grocery
the 
cans 
, 
frozen 
items 
, 
snacks 
and 
produce 
in 
a 
different 
spot 
in 
the 
shopping 
cart 
. 
she 
also 
mentioned UnrelEv_grocery
that 
it 
always 
kept 
me 
occupied UnrelEv_grocery
and 
i 
never 
begged+for UnrelEv_grocery
any 
chips 
or 
sugary 
enriched 
items 
. 
so 
my 
mother 
loved UnrelEv_grocery
to 
take ScrEv_go_grocery
me 
grocery+shopping Evoking_grocery
. 
i 
think UnrelEv_grocery
that 
since 
she 
always 
took ScrEv_go_grocery
me 
grocery+shopping Evoking_grocery
with 
her 
, 
that 
is 
why 
i 
love UnrelEv_grocery
to 
go ScrEv_go_grocery
grocery+shopping Evoking_grocery
now 
that 
i 
am UnrelEv_grocery
an 
adult 
. 
i 
walk+around ScrEv_move_section
the 
store 
with 
a 
shopping 
list 
and 
mark+off ScrEv_check_off
the 
items 
as 
i 
walk+down ScrEv_move_section
the 
aisles 
. 
i 
then 
go ScrEv_move_section
to 
the 
cashier 
and 
quickly 
put ScrEv_put_conveyor
my 
items 
up 
on 
the 
side 
and 
they 
are 
all 
rung+up ScrEv_cashier_scan/weight
and 
i 
swipe ScrEv_pay
the 
credit 
card 
and 
take RelNScrEv_grocery
my 
groceries 
home 
. 
<end_of_story>_grocery 
i 
went ScrEv_go_grocery
grocery+shopping Evoking_grocery
late 
last 
night 
. 
i 
like 
going ScrEv_go_grocery
at 
night 
because 
it 
's 
not 
so 
crowded RelNScrEv_grocery
. 
first 
i 
made ScrEv_make_list
a 
list 
of 
the 
things 
i 
needed RelNScrEv_grocery
then 
headed ScrEv_go_grocery
to 
the 
store 
. 
another 
nice 
thing 
about 
shopping ScrEv_get_groceries
late 
is 
that 
you 
get 
to 
park RelNScrEv_grocery
right 
near 
the 
door 
, 
which 
makes UnrelEv_grocery
things 
easier 
when 
you 
come+out ScrEv_leave
. 
once 
i 
got+inside ScrEv_enter
, 
i 
grabbed ScrEv_take_shop_cart
a 
shopping 
cart 
and 
took+out ScrEv_check_list
my 
list 
. 
there 
was UnrelEv_grocery
nothing 
out 
of 
the 
ordinary 
on 
the 
list 
, 
so 
i 
started UnrelEv_grocery
heading+down ScrEv_move_section
the 
aisles 
just 
like 
i 
always 
do UnrelEv_grocery
. 
i 
always 
keep+track RelNScrEv_grocery
of 
the 
cost 
of 
everything 
i 
pick+out ScrEv_get_groceries
on 
my 
tablet 
as 
i 
go ScrEv_move_section
so 
that 
i 
know UnrelEv_grocery
if 
i 
can 
afford UnrelEv_grocery
anything 
extra 
. 
the 
time 
a 
couple 
thing 
i 
needed+were RelNScrEv_grocery
on 
sale 
, 
so 
i 
did 
have UnrelEv_grocery
some 
extra 
money 
. 
i 
decided UnrelEv_grocery
that 
i 
needed RelNScrEv_grocery
some 
cookies 
and 
headed+over ScrEv_move_section
the 
the 
cookie 
aisle 
. 
i 
looked UnrelEv_grocery
at 
the 
oreos 
for 
a 
little 
while 
, 
then 
checked RelNScrEv_grocery
the 
other 
cookies 
. 
i 
decided UnrelEv_grocery
on 
chocolate 
chip 
cookies 
this 
time 
, 
so 
i 
put ScrEv_get_groceries
the 
on 
top 
of 
the 
other 
things 
in 
my 
cart 
and 
went ScrEv_go_checkout
to 
the 
checkout 
lane 
. 
i 
paid ScrEv_pay
and 
got 
everything 
bagged ScrEv_pack_groceries
, 
then 
headed+out ScrEv_bring_vehicle
to 
my 
car 
. 
i 
got ScrEv_bring_vehicle
everything 
in 
the 
trunk 
, 
put ScrEv_return_shop_cart
the 
cart 
away 
and 
headed ScrEv_leave
home 
to 
put RelNScrEv_grocery
my 
groceries 
away 
and 
have UnrelEv_grocery
some 
chocolate 
chip 
cookies 
. 
<end_of_story>_grocery 
yesterday 
, 
i 
went+grocery+shopping Evoking_grocery
. 
before 
i 
had 
left ScrEv_go_grocery
, 
i 
made ScrEv_make_list
a 
list 
of 
most 
of 
the 
things 
that 
i 
needed RelNScrEv_grocery
to 
buy ScrEv_get_groceries
for 
the 
week 
. 
i 
looked RelNScrEv_grocery
at 
the 
sales 
advertisement 
that 
had 
come UnrelEv_grocery
in 
the 
mail 
and 
made UnrelEv_grocery
a 
note 
of 
a 
few 
things 
that 
were RelNScrEv_grocery
on 
sale 
. 
i 
needed RelNScrEv_grocery
to 
buy ScrEv_get_groceries
milk 
, 
bread 
, 
eggs 
, 
coffee 
, 
and 
some 
items 
to 
make UnrelEv_grocery
lunches 
for 
me 
to 
take UnrelEv_grocery
to 
work 
for 
the 
week 
. 
when 
i 
got ScrEv_go_grocery
to 
the 
store 
, 
i 
first 
went ScrEv_move_section
to 
the 
deli 
and 
picked+out ScrEv_get_groceries
some 
lunch 
meat 
. 
i 
got ScrEv_get_groceries
some 
turkey 
, 
ham 
, 
and 
salami 
. 
i 
then 
picked+up ScrEv_get_groceries
some 
cheddar 
cheese 
. 
near 
the 
deli 
, 
i 
grabbed ScrEv_get_groceries
some 
bread 
, 
which 
happened UnrelEv_grocery
to 
be RelNScrEv_grocery
on 
sale 
. 
a 
few 
isles 
over 
, 
i 
found ScrEv_get_groceries
some 
decent 
coffee 
that 
was RelNScrEv_grocery
not 
on 
sale 
. 
my 
shopping ScrEv_get_groceries
was RelNScrEv_grocery
almost 
complete 
after 
i 
picked+up ScrEv_get_groceries
a 
half 
gallon 
of 
milk 
and 
a 
dozen 
eggs 
. 
i 
saw UnrelEv_grocery
that 
the 
yogurt 
was RelNScrEv_grocery
on 
sale 
, 
so 
i 
grabbed ScrEv_get_groceries
a 
few 
of 
those 
in 
my 
favorite 
flavors 
. 
i 
was 
trying UnrelEv_grocery
to 
find ScrEv_get_groceries
some 
other 
things 
to 
make UnrelEv_grocery
my 
lunch 
with 
, 
so 
i 
grabbed ScrEv_get_groceries
some 
bananas 
. 
i 
also 
picked+up ScrEv_get_groceries
a 
bag 
of 
chips 
. 
it 
looked UnrelEv_grocery
like 
i 
had UnrelEv_grocery
everything 
that 
i 
needed RelNScrEv_grocery
for 
making UnrelEv_grocery
lunches 
for 
the 
week 
. 
i 
was UnrelEv_grocery
ready 
to 
leave ScrEv_leave
, 
so 
i 
made ScrEv_move_section
my 
way 
towards 
the 
front 
of 
the 
store 
. 
i 
went ScrEv_move_section
into 
the 
express 
line 
because 
i 
had RelNScrEv_grocery
less 
than 
twenty 
items 
. 
i 
was 
finally 
done UnrelEv_grocery
and 
i 
ended+up+finishing UnrelEv_grocery
my 
shopping ScrEv_get_groceries
in 
less 
than 
a 
half 
hour 
. 
i 
was 
pleased UnrelEv_grocery
with 
my 
efficiency 
. 
<end_of_story>_grocery 
most 
people 
grocery+shop Evoking_grocery
once 
a 
week 
. 
in 
my 
house 
that 
really 
does 
n't 
work UnrelEv_grocery
for 
us 
; 
my 
wife 
and 
i 
work UnrelEv_grocery
shifts 
that 
could 
change UnrelEv_grocery
and 
we 
never 
know UnrelEv_grocery
when 
our 
son 
will 
or 
wo 
n't 
be UnrelEv_grocery
home 
so 
when 
i 
shop ScrEv_go_grocery
for 
groceries 
it 
's 
only 
looking UnrelEv_grocery
one 
or 
two 
days 
ahead 
. 
there 
's 
two 
places 
that 
i 
usually 
go ScrEv_go_grocery
for 
my 
groceries 
; 
i 
either 
shop ScrEv_go_grocery
at 
wegmans 
, 
which 
is 
a 
grocery 
store 
near 
where 
i 
work UnrelEv_grocery
, 
or 
walmart 
, 
of 
which 
there 
are UnrelEv_grocery
two 
near 
me 
, 
about 
equal 
distances 
from 
where 
i 
work UnrelEv_grocery
. 
i 
'll 
talk UnrelEv_grocery
to 
my 
wife 
before 
i 
leave UnrelEv_grocery
work 
, 
we 
'll 
decide UnrelEv_grocery
on 
dinner 
and 
then 
i 
'll 
go ScrEv_go_grocery
to 
whichever 
store 
i 
decide UnrelEv_grocery
on 
-lrb- 
for 
example 
, 
if 
we 
're 
having UnrelEv_grocery
fresh 
meat 
we 
prefer UnrelEv_grocery
to 
get ScrEv_get_groceries
it 
at 
wegmans 
, 
but 
if 
we 
're 
making UnrelEv_grocery
a 
casserole 
or 
something 
similar 
i 
can 
get ScrEv_get_groceries
it 
at 
wegmans 
-rrb- 
. 
i 
'll 
leave UnrelEv_grocery
work 
, 
head ScrEv_go_grocery
to 
whichever 
store 
i 
've 
chosen UnrelEv_grocery
and 
, 
without 
spending UnrelEv_grocery
alot 
of 
time 
wandering UnrelEv_grocery
, 
get ScrEv_get_groceries
the 
exact 
items 
i 
need RelNScrEv_grocery
, 
pay ScrEv_pay
for 
them 
and 
leave ScrEv_leave
. 
to 
me 
, 
grocery+shopping Evoking_grocery
is 
more 
of 
a 
necessity 
than 
something 
i 
enjoy UnrelEv_grocery
so 
i 
want UnrelEv_grocery
it 
done UnrelEv_grocery
quickly 
. 
<end_of_story>_grocery 
with 
a 
family 
of 
five 
it 
seemed 
like 
all 
we 
ever 
did 
was 
go+to+the+supermarket Evoking_grocery
. 
walmart 
and 
i 
built UnrelEv_grocery
a 
strong 
personal 
relationship 
. 
not 
only 
did 
they 
have UnrelEv_grocery
household 
items 
and 
clothes 
that 
i 
loved 
, 
they 
had UnrelEv_grocery
food 
. 
every 
week 
i 
spend UnrelEv_grocery
an 
hour 
online 
printing RelNScrEv_grocery
and 
sorting RelNScrEv_grocery
my 
coupons 
. 
it 
is 
always 
to 
good 
to 
grab RelNScrEv_grocery
extra 
deals 
even 
if 
it 
is RelNScrEv_grocery
just 
cents 
off 
. 
after 
compiling RelNScrEv_grocery
my 
coupons 
i 
make ScrEv_make_list
my 
shopping 
list 
and 
break RelNScrEv_grocery
it 
down 
to 
aisles 
. 
it 
's 
so 
amazing 
that 
i 
have 
been UnrelEv_grocery
to 
walmart 
so 
many 
times 
that 
i 
remember UnrelEv_grocery
their 
aisles 
. 
when 
i 
arrive ScrEv_move_section
in 
the 
food 
section 
i 
start UnrelEv_grocery
with 
the 
middle 
aisles 
first 
and 
then 
i 
work ScrEv_move_section
my 
way 
around 
, 
getting ScrEv_get_groceries
milk 
last 
. 
sometimes 
i 
have 
to 
buy ScrEv_get_groceries
so 
many 
things 
that 
i 
leave ScrEv_leave
with 
two 
or 
three 
carts 
. 
grocery+shopping Evoking_grocery
is UnrelEv_grocery
beyond 
a 
tedious 
task 
that 
i 
hate UnrelEv_grocery
to 
love UnrelEv_grocery
. 
<end_of_story>_grocery 
before 
going+shopping Evoking_grocery
i 
make ScrEv_make_list
a

my 
fridge 
and 
cupboards 
to 
make UnrelEv_grocery
sure 
i 
buy ScrEv_get_groceries
everything 
i

get ScrEv_go_grocery
into 
my 
car 
and 
drive ScrEv_go_grocery
to 
the 
store 
. 
upon 
entering ScrEv_enter
the 
store 
i 
grab ScrEv_take_shop_cart
a 
shopping 
cart 
and 
walk ScrEv_move_section
to 
the 
fresh 
fruits 
and 
vegetables 
. 
after 
getting ScrEv_get_groceries
all 
of 
my 
fresh 
items 
i 
go ScrEv_move_section
to 
the 
butcher 
stand 
and 
get ScrEv_get_groceries
some 
chicken 
and 
beef 
. 
i 
sometimes 
make ScrEv_move_section
a 
stop 
to 
et 
lunch 
meat 
and 
bread 
so 
i 
can 
make UnrelEv_grocery
sandwiches 
for 
lunch 
. 
next 
i 
go ScrEv_move_section
to 
the 
dairy 
section

buy ScrEv_get_groceries
some

to 
end UnrelEv_grocery
my 
trip 
i 
go ScrEv_move_section
to 
the 
frozen

section 
because 
i 
want UnrelEv_grocery
to 
make UnrelEv_grocery
sure 
my 
frozen

stay RelNScrEv_grocery
cold 
until

i 
get ScrEv_go_checkout

i 
almost 
always 
pay ScrEv_pay

so 
i 
do 
n't 
have 
to 
worry UnrelEv_grocery
about 
money

i 
then 
leave ScrEv_leave
the

<end_of_story>_grocery 
sunday

recorded ScrEv_make_list
in 
his

we

at 
the

in 
the 
early 
afternoon 
, 
and 
the 
first 
thing 
we 
did 
was 
get ScrEv_take_shop_cart
a 
shopping 
cart 
. 
we 
walked+in ScrEv_enter
and 
went ScrEv_move_section
to 
the 
produce 
area 
first 
, 
where 
all 
the 
fruit 
and 
vegetables 
are UnrelEv_grocery
. 
my 
husband 
checked ScrEv_check_list
the 
list 
. 
we 
only 
had RelNScrEv_grocery
bananas 
on 
the 
list 
, 
but 
i 
said UnrelEv_grocery
we 
should 
get ScrEv_get_groceries
things 
for 
salad 
, 
too 
, 
so 
he 
picked+out ScrEv_get_groceries
bananas 
and 
bell 
peppers 
while 
i 
got ScrEv_get_groceries
lettuce 
and 
radishes 
and 
tomatoes 
. 
then 
we 
went ScrEv_move_section
to 
the 
deli 
area 
and 
ordered ScrEv_other_grocery
some 
sliced 
turkey 
. 
the 
man 
behind 
the 
counter 
sliced ScrEv_other_grocery
the 
turkey 
for 
us 
and 
measured ScrEv_other_grocery
it 
on 
a 
scale 
to 
give ScrEv_get_groceries
us 
the 
amount 
we 
wanted UnrelEv_grocery
, 
then 
wrapped ScrEv_pack_groceries
it 
up 
for 
us 
. 
next 
we 
visited ScrEv_move_section
the 
bakery 
area 
and 
picked+out ScrEv_get_groceries
a 
nice 
loaf 
of 
rye 
bread 
to 
put UnrelEv_grocery
the 
turkey 
on 
. 
in 
the 
canned UnrelEv_grocery
goods 
area 
, 
we 
picked+out ScrEv_get_groceries

pasta 
and 
sauce 
. 
in 
the 
meat 
area 
, 
we 
picked+up ScrEv_get_groceries
some 
chicken 
breasts 
and 
italian 
sausage 
. 
then 
we 
went ScrEv_move_section
to 
the

refrigerators 
and 
we 
each 
picked+out ScrEv_get_groceries
some 
flavors 
of 
yogurt 
we 
like UnrelEv_grocery
, 
and 
got ScrEv_get_groceries
milk 
and 
butter 
and 
eggs 
. 
we 
were 
nearly 
done UnrelEv_grocery
, 
so 
my 
husband 
checked ScrEv_check_list
the 
list 
again 
and 
we 
saw 
we 
had 
forgotten UnrelEv_grocery
tin 
foil 
and 
toilet 
paper 
, 
so 
we 
went+back ScrEv_move_section
and 
got ScrEv_get_groceries
those 
two 
things 
. 
then 
we 
went ScrEv_go_checkout
to 
the 
check-out 
where 
we 
put ScrEv_put_conveyor
all 
our 
groceries 
on 
a 
conveyor 
belt 
and 
the 
clerk 
scanned ScrEv_cashier_scan/weight
each 
item 
in 
an 
electronic 
scanner 
to 
find+out ScrEv_cashier_scan/weight
what 
it 
cost RelNScrEv_grocery

she 
told UnrelEv_grocery
us 
the 
total 
, 
and 
i 
swiped ScrEv_pay
my 
bank 
card 
through 
an 
electronic 
reader 
to 
pay ScrEv_pay
. 
meanwhile 
, 
a 
bagger 
was 
putting ScrEv_pack_groceries
our 
groceries 
into 
re-usable 
shopping 
bags 
that 
we 
had 
brought ScrEv_take_bags
with 
us 
. 
he 
put ScrEv_other_grocery
the 
bags 
back 
into 
the 
cart 
. 
we 
got ScrEv_get_receipt
a 
receipt 
from 
the 
clerk 
and 
pushed ScrEv_bring_vehicle
the 
cart 
out 
to 
our 
car 
, 
where 
we 
moved ScrEv_bring_vehicle
the 
bags 
into 
the 
back 
seat 
. 
then 
my 
husband 
put ScrEv_return_shop_cart
the 
cart 
in 
little 
corral 
in 
the 
parking 
lot 
that 
keeps UnrelEv_grocery
the 
carts 
away 
from 
people 
's 
cars 
, 
and 
we 
got+in ScrEv_leave
our 
car 
and 
went ScrEv_leave
home 
. 
<end_of_story>_grocery 
last 
night 
i 
realized UnrelEv_grocery
i 
did 
not 
have UnrelEv_grocery
anything 
for 
dinner 
. 
to 
solve UnrelEv_grocery
this 
conundrum 
i 
first 
thought UnrelEv_grocery
about 
ordering UnrelEv_grocery
out 
food 
. 
this 
, 
i 
realized UnrelEv_grocery
, 
was UnrelEv_grocery
too 
expensive 
as 
i 
am 
a 
broke 
college 
graduate 
just 
trying 
to 
get UnrelEv_grocery
by 
. 
i 
settled UnrelEv_grocery
on 
an 
alternative 
, 
going+to+the+grocery+store Evoking_grocery
to 
purchase ScrEv_get_groceries
food 
. 
i 
walked+down ScrEv_go_grocery
the 
street 
from 
my 
apartment 
to 
the 
whole 
foods 
in 
the 
brisk 
spring 
air 
. 
i 
was UnrelEv_grocery
on 
a 
mission 
, 
purchase ScrEv_get_groceries
delicious 
food 
. 
when 
i 
reached ScrEv_go_grocery
the 
whole 
foods 
, 
the 
distinct 
smell 
of 
smug 
filled UnrelEv_grocery
my 
nostrils 
. 
organic 
, 
natural 
, 
non 
deoderized UnrelEv_grocery
humans 
paced ScrEv_move_section
to 
and 
fro 
within 
the 
confines 
of 
the 
kale 
infused UnrelEv_grocery
shelving 
units 
. 
i 
quickly 
scuttled ScrEv_move_section
to 
the 
small 
frozen 
foods 
section 
to 
purchase ScrEv_get_groceries
some 
` 
healthy 
' 
junk 
food 
. 
i 
selected ScrEv_get_groceries
chicken 
tenders 
and 
a 
small 
frozen 
pizza 
. 
skirting UnrelEv_grocery
the 
weed 
smoking UnrelEv_grocery
hippies 
throughout 
the 
store 
i 
returned ScrEv_move_section
to 
the 
front 
. 
i 
quickly 
made ScrEv_get_groceries
my 
purchase 
and 
sprinted+back ScrEv_leave
towards 
home 
to 
concoct UnrelEv_grocery
my 
wonderfully 
delicious 
tendies 
and 
pizza 
. 
<end_of_story>_grocery 
grocery+shopping Evoking_grocery
can 
be UnrelEv_grocery
a 
stressful 
event 
, 
but 
if 
you 
come ScrEv_go_grocery
prepared UnrelEv_grocery
then 
you 
can 
usually 
leave ScrEv_leave
without 
a 
headache 
. 
before 
we 
head+over ScrEv_go_grocery
to 
the 
store 
we 
need RelNScrEv_grocery
to 
make ScrEv_make_list
a 
list 
of 
all 
the 
items 
that 
we 
need RelNScrEv_grocery
. 
once 
you 
arrive ScrEv_enter
at 
the 
store 
if 
you 
have UnrelEv_grocery
a 
short 
list 
make UnrelEv_grocery
sure 
to 
grab ScrEv_take_shop_cart
a 
basket 
. 
if 
you 
are 
purchasing ScrEv_get_groceries
a 
wider 
variety 
of 
items 
then 
grab ScrEv_take_shop_cart
a 
shopping 
cart 
. 
i 
would 
recommend UnrelEv_grocery
starting Unclear_grocery
on 
the 
outside 
perimeter 
of 
the 
store 
, 
hitting+up ScrEv_get_groceries
your 
dairy 
, 
meats 
, 
and 
vegetables 
. 
while 
you 
are 
working ScrEv_move_section
your 
way 
clockwise 
or 
counter-clockwise 
you 
can 
frequent ScrEv_move_section
the 
aisles 
in 
the 
middle 
to 
pickup ScrEv_get_groceries
the 
remainder 
of 
items 
. 
spending RelNScrEv_grocery
a 
lot 
of 
time 
in 
the 
aisles 
can 
become+frustrating UnrelEv_grocery
since 
people 
are 
more 
likely 
to 
be UnrelEv_grocery
in 
your 
way 
. 
after 
you 
select ScrEv_get_groceries
all 
the 
items 
to 
purchase ScrEv_get_groceries
, 
find ScrEv_go_checkout
the 
shortest 
checkout 
line 
. 
once 
you 
are UnrelEv_grocery
close 
enough 
start UnrelEv_grocery
piling ScrEv_put_conveyor
your 
groceries 
on 
the 
belt 
, 
and 
take+out ScrEv_pay
your 
form 
of 
payment 
. 
once 
paid ScrEv_pay
, 
the 
store 
will 
generally 
bag ScrEv_pack_groceries
your 
groceries 
for 
you 
. 
now 
you 
just 
need UnrelEv_grocery
to 
load ScrEv_bring_vehicle
your 
car 
, 
drive ScrEv_leave
home 
, 
and 
unload RelNScrEv_grocery
all 
of 
your 
bounty 
! 
<end_of_story>_grocery 
i 
love UnrelEv_grocery
going+grocery+shopping Evoking_grocery
! 
usually 
i 
am 
going ScrEv_go_grocery
with 
my 
ten 
month 
old 
son 
while 
my 
husband 
is UnrelEv_grocery
at 
work 
. 
before 
i 
go ScrEv_go_grocery
, 
i 
make ScrEv_make_list
a 
list 
of 
what 
we 
need RelNScrEv_grocery
or 
else 
i 
will 
buy ScrEv_get_groceries
things 
that 
i 
do 
not 
need RelNScrEv_grocery
. 
i 
check RelNScrEv_grocery
sales 
to 
make UnrelEv_grocery
sure 
i 
get RelNScrEv_grocery
the 
best 
deals 
on 
things 
and 
make UnrelEv_grocery
a 
meal 
plan 
. 
then 
i 
get UnrelEv_grocery
my 
son 
in 
the 
car 
and 
we 
drive+over ScrEv_go_grocery
the 
the 
grocery 
store 
. 
we 
get ScrEv_take_shop_cart
a 
cart 
and 
i 
put UnrelEv_grocery
my 
son 
in 
it 
. 
i 
give UnrelEv_grocery
him 
a 
toy 
and 
secure RelNScrEv_grocery
it 
to 
the 
cart 
after 
i 
wipe UnrelEv_grocery
it 
down 
to 
make UnrelEv_grocery
sure 
its 
clean 
, 
and 
we 
enter ScrEv_enter
the 
store 
. 
we 
go+through ScrEv_move_section
the 
store 
and 
using RelNScrEv_grocery
my 
list 
grab ScrEv_get_groceries
what 
i 
need RelNScrEv_grocery
. 
since 
i 
usually 
go ScrEv_go_grocery
two 
or 
more 
times 
a 
week 
, 
i 
only 
spend RelNScrEv_grocery
about 
523 
minutes 
there 
before 
i 
have 
all 
we 
need RelNScrEv_grocery
and 
can 
pay ScrEv_pay
. 
then 
we 
go+back ScrEv_bring_vehicle
out 
to 
the 
car 
. 
i 
put UnrelEv_grocery
my 
son 
back 
in 
his 
car 
seat 
and 
the 
bagged ScrEv_pack_groceries
groceries 
in 
the 
trunk 
and 
head ScrEv_leave
home 
. 
<end_of_story>_grocery 
as 
i 
was 
preparing UnrelEv_grocery
breakfast 
, 
i 
noticed UnrelEv_grocery
that 
i 
was RelNScrEv_grocery
out 
of 
a 
lot 
of 
things 
that 
are UnrelEv_grocery
staples 
in 
the 
preparation 
of 
most 
other 
dishes 
. 
bread 
, 
milk 
, 
and 
things 
of 
that 
nature 
. 
so 
after 
i 
was 
done UnrelEv_grocery
with 
breakfast 
, 
i 
sat+down UnrelEv_grocery
to 
prepare+a+grocery+shopping+list Evoking_grocery
. 
i 
thought UnrelEv_grocery
of 
all 
the 
things 
off 
the 
top 
of 
my 
head 
that 
i 
would 
need RelNScrEv_grocery
, 
and 
then 
i 
perused RelNScrEv_grocery
through 
my 
cupboards 
and 
refrigerator 
to 
fill+in ScrEv_make_list
the 
blanks 
. 
once 
i 
was 
satisfied UnrelEv_grocery
with 
my 
list 
, 
i 
got+dressed UnrelEv_grocery
and 
got ScrEv_go_grocery
in 
my 
car 
. 
i 
drove ScrEv_go_grocery
to 
the 
grocery 
store 
and 
parked RelNScrEv_grocery
. 
i 
grabbed ScrEv_take_shop_cart
a 
cart 
and 
pulled ScrEv_check_list
my 
shopping 
list 
out 
of 
my 
purse 
. 
i 
went ScrEv_move_section
up 
and 
down 
the 
aisles 
, 
placing ScrEv_get_groceries
things 
in 
the 
cart 
as 
i 
went ScrEv_move_section
. 
once 
i 
had UnrelEv_grocery
everything 
, 
i 
went ScrEv_go_checkout
to 
the 
checkout 
counter 
. 
i 
put ScrEv_put_conveyor
all 
my 
things 
on 
the 
belt 
and 
a 
bagger 
bagged ScrEv_pack_groceries
them 
as 
the 
cashier 
scanned ScrEv_cashier_scan/weight
. 
the 
bagger 
set ScrEv_pack_groceries
the 
bags 
in 
my 
cart 
, 
and 
i 
took ScrEv_bring_vehicle
the 
bags 
out 
to 
my 
car 
. 
once 
i 
got ScrEv_leave
home 
, 
i 
brought RelNScrEv_grocery
the 
bags 
inside 
and 
put RelNScrEv_grocery
all 
the 
groceries 
away 
. 
this 
is 
how 
i 
went ScrEv_go_grocery
grocery+shopping Evoking_grocery
.

i 
wanted UnrelEv_bus
to 
go+shopping UnrelEv_bus
downtown 
, 
so 
i 
decided UnrelEv_bus
to 
take+the+public+bus Evoking_bus
. 
i 
waited ScrEv_wait
at 
the 
bus 
stop 
where 
other 
people 
were 
also 
waiting ScrEv_wait
. 
the 
bus 
came ScrEv_bus_comes
right 
on 
time 
and 
pulled+over ScrEv_other_bus
to 
the 
curb 
. 
i 
waited ScrEv_wait
for 
the 
people 
getting+off ScrEv_get_off
the 
bus 
to 
step+down RelNScrEv_bus
. 
then 
i 
waited ScrEv_wait
in 
line 
as 
each 
person 
got+on ScrEv_board_bus
. 
when 
it 
was UnrelEv_bus
my 
turn 
i 
stepped+up ScrEv_board_bus
the 
few 
steps 
into 
front 
of 
the 
bus 
. 
i 
swiped RelNScrEv_bus
my 
bus 
card 
to 
pay ScrEv_get_ticket
, 
smiled UnrelEv_bus
at 
the 
driver 
, 
and 
chose ScrEv_find_place
a 
seat 
. 
the 
bus 
was UnrelEv_bus
a 
little 
crowded UnrelEv_bus
, 
so 
i 
stood UnrelEv_bus
and 
held+onto RelNScrEv_bus
the 
bar 
. 
an 
elderly 
woman 
got+on ScrEv_board_bus
the 
bus 
next 
, 
and 
a 
younger 
person 
got+up UnrelEv_bus
to 
give RelNScrEv_bus
her 
his 
seat 
. 
when 
everyone 
was UnrelEv_bus
on 
, 
the 
bus 
put+on ScrEv_other_bus
his 
turn 
signal 
and 
pulled ScrEv_bus_leaves
back 
into 
the 
street 
. 
as 
i 
got UnrelEv_bus
closer 
to 
my 
stop 
, 
i 
pulled ScrEv_press_stop_button
the 
cord 
. 
the 
cord 
dinged ScrEv_other_bus
to 
signal UnrelEv_bus
that 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_bus
to 
get+off ScrEv_get_off
. 
the 
bus 
pulled ScrEv_bus_stops
into 
the 
stop 
where 
other 
people 
were 
waiting ScrEv_wait
to 
get+on ScrEv_board_bus
. 
they 
waited ScrEv_wait
until 
i 
got+off ScrEv_get_off
before 
boarding ScrEv_board_bus

<end_of_story>_bus 
i 
live UnrelEv_bus
near 
blacksburg 
, 
virginia 
and 
often 
stay UnrelEv_bus
with 
friends 
who 
live UnrelEv_bus
near 
virginia 
tech 
. 
a 
bus+route Evoking_bus
stops UnrelEv_bus
at 
their 
apartment 
complex 
and 
we 
often 
ride+it Evoking_bus
downtown 
to 
eat UnrelEv_bus
brunch 
after 
a 
late 
night 
. 
nothing 
unusual 
ever 
happens UnrelEv_bus
. 
we 
get UnrelEv_bus
ready 
and 
go ScrEv_get_bus_stop
to 
the 
bus 
stop 
. 
there 
's UnrelEv_bus
a 
bench 
and 
it 
's+covered UnrelEv_bus
but 
there 
's UnrelEv_bus
no 
doors 
. 
the 
bus 
is ScrEv_bus_comes
always 
on 
time 
and 
we 
hop+on ScrEv_board_bus
. 
it 
's RelNScrEv_bus
never 
crowded UnrelEv_bus
so 
we 
can UnrelEv_bus
always 
find ScrEv_find_place
a 
seat 
. 
the 
varying 
bus 
drivers 
are RelNScrEv_bus
nice 
and 
we 
hop+on ScrEv_board_bus
, 
pay ScrEv_get_ticket
, 
and 
take ScrEv_find_place
our 
seats 
. 
the 
ride 
downtown 
takes RelNScrEv_bus
about 
523 
minutes 
because 
of 
other 
stops 
. 
no 
other 
passengers 
ever 
talk UnrelEv_bus
to 
each 
other 
and 
honestly 
groups 
of 
friends 
from 
different 
races 
stick UnrelEv_bus
together 
. 
being UnrelEv_bus
near 
a 
college 
such 
as 
virginia 
tech 
makes+for UnrelEv_bus
a 
very 
diverse 
area 
where 
different 
cultures 
intermingle UnrelEv_bus
but 
the 
bus 
seems UnrelEv_bus
to 
have RelNScrEv_bus
the 
most 
obviously 
segregated UnrelEv_bus
groups 
. 
we 
get+to ScrEv_ride
our 
stop 
and 
enjoy UnrelEv_bus
brunch 
. 
i 
like UnrelEv_bus
riding ScrEv_ride
the 
bus 
because 
of 
the 
convenience 
factor 
, 
no 
parking UnrelEv_bus
, 
and 
it 
feels UnrelEv_bus
like 
we 
are 
doing UnrelEv_bus
something 
to 
help UnrelEv_bus
the 
environment 
. 
<end_of_story>_bus 
last 
saturday 
, 
i 
decided UnrelEv_bus
to 
visit UnrelEv_bus
a 
friend 
in 
the 
hospital 
. 
i 
own UnrelEv_bus
a 
car 
, 
but 
it 
's 
been 
acting+up UnrelEv_bus
lately 
, 
so 
i 
needed 
to 
take+the+bus Evoking_bus
. 
i 
set+out UnrelEv_bus
from 
my 
apartment 
with 
a 
spring 
in 
my 
step 
, 
because 
it 
was UnrelEv_bus
an 
amazing 
day 
. 
i 
walked UnrelEv_bus
through 
my 
apartment 
complex 
's 
parking 
lot 
to 
reach ScrEv_get_bus_stop
the 
bus 
stop 
, 
where 
i 
waited ScrEv_wait
for 
the 
bus 
around 
523 
minutes 
. 
when 
it 
came ScrEv_bus_comes
to 
a 
stop 
in 
front 
of 
me 
, 
i 
boarded ScrEv_board_bus
and 
put ScrEv_get_ticket
a 
$ 
523 
bill 
and 
523 
quarters 
in 
the 
fare 
machine 
. 
i 
selected ScrEv_find_place
a 
seat 
near 
the 
entrance 
, 
because 
it 
has RelNScrEv_bus
more 
space 
and 
fewer 
people 
. 
riding RelNScrEv_bus
the 
bus 
often 
gives RelNScrEv_bus
me 
motion 
sickness 
, 
so 
i 
closed UnrelEv_bus
my 
eyes 
and 
tried UnrelEv_bus
to 
ignore UnrelEv_bus
the 
swaying UnrelEv_bus
motion 
as 
it 
rolled+down RelNScrEv_bus
the 
street 
. 
behind 
me 
, 
two 
college 
students 
were 
eagerly 
discussing UnrelEv_bus
a 
class 
project 
. 
in 
the 
very 
back 
, 
a 
small 
child 
was 
loudly 
pretending UnrelEv_bus
to 
be 
a 
dinosaur 
. 
i 
was UnrelEv_bus
glad 
when 
i 
finally 
reached ScrEv_other_bus
my 
destination 
. 
i 
pulled ScrEv_press_stop_button
the 
cord 
signaling RelNScrEv_bus
that 
i 
would 
need 
the 
bus 
to 
stop RelNScrEv_bus
next 
to 
the 
hospital 
, 
and 
got+up ScrEv_other_bus
to 
exit ScrEv_get_off
out 
the 
bus 
's 
side 
door 
. 
fresh 
air 
never 
smelled UnrelEv_bus
so 
good 
! 
<end_of_story>_bus 
my 
husband 
and 
i 
decided UnrelEv_bus
we 
'd 
go+down UnrelEv_bus
to 
owning UnrelEv_bus
just 
one 
car 
in 
the 
fall 
of 
523 
. 
i 
was 
not 
going 
to 
be 
working UnrelEv_bus
away 
from 
home 
during 
523 
so 
we 
thought UnrelEv_bus
we 
could 
share UnrelEv_bus
and 
most 
of 
the 
time 
that 
went UnrelEv_bus
pretty 
well 
, 
but 
there 
were UnrelEv_bus
times 
when 
i 
had 
to 
take+the+bus Evoking_bus
. 
i 
knew UnrelEv_bus
i 
needed 
to 
get UnrelEv_bus
from 
a 
final 
day 
of 
teaching 
, 
for 
example 
, 
at 
the 
university 
to 
downtown 
to 
meet+up UnrelEv_bus
with 
my 
husband 
. 
i 
checked ScrEv_other_bus
the 
bus 
schedules 
online 
and 
determined UnrelEv_bus
i 
needed 
to 
take+the+number+7+bus Evoking_bus
. 
i 
plotted ScrEv_other_bus
this 
out 
on 
my 
phone 
as 
well 
so 
i 
'd 
know UnrelEv_bus
the 
time 
for 
sure 
. 
i 
walked+across ScrEv_get_bus_stop
campus 
and 
waited ScrEv_wait
at 
the 
stop 
. 
i 
had 
to 
wait ScrEv_wait
about 
523 
minutes 
before 
the 
bus 
came ScrEv_bus_comes
. 
since 
this 
was UnrelEv_bus
just 
one 
trip 
i 
had UnrelEv_bus
cash 
that 
i 
put ScrEv_get_ticket
into 
the 
bus 
meter 
and 
found ScrEv_find_place
a 
seat 
. 
the 
bus 
made ScrEv_bus_stops
a 
lot 
of 
stops 
on 
its 
way 
to 
downtown 
and 
i 
did 
n't 
take RelNScrEv_bus
it 
as 
far 
as 
i 
could 
have 
to 
meet+up UnrelEv_bus
with 
my 
husband 
. 
instead 
i 
got+off ScrEv_get_off
at 
an 
earlier 
stop 
once 
i 
recognized UnrelEv_bus
the 
area 
and 
walked UnrelEv_bus
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_bus
a 
regular 
stop 
so 
i 
did 
n't 
have 
to 
pull RelNScrEv_bus
the 
cord 
to 
ask UnrelEv_bus
the 
driver 
to 
let RelNScrEv_bus
me 
off 
. 
'' 
, 
true 
story 
: 
<end_of_story>_bus 
i 
needed 
to 
get UnrelEv_bus
to 
the 
craft 
store 
, 
there 
was UnrelEv_bus
a 
sale 
! 
unfortunately 
, 
husband 
had UnrelEv_bus
the 
car 
and 
he 
would 
be+gone UnrelEv_bus
a 
while 
. 
i 
decided UnrelEv_bus
to 
take+the+bus Evoking_bus
. 
i 
made+sure RelNScrEv_bus
i 
had UnrelEv_bus
a 
couple 
dollars 
for 
the 
fare 
and 
walked ScrEv_get_bus_stop
to 
the 
bus 
stop 
. 
i 
waited ScrEv_wait
about 
ten 
minutes 
, 
then 
the 
bus 
came ScrEv_bus_comes
around 
the 
corner 
and 
stopped ScrEv_bus_comes
at 
the 
bench 
i 
was 
sitting UnrelEv_bus
. 
a 
few 
people 
got+off ScrEv_get_off
the 
bus 
and 
i 
stepped+through ScrEv_board_bus
the 
doors 
onto 
the 
bus 
. 
i 
smiled UnrelEv_bus
at 
the 
bus 
driver 
and 
put ScrEv_get_ticket
the 
money 
into 
the 
machine 
to 
pay ScrEv_get_ticket
for 
my 
ride 
. 
i 
took ScrEv_find_place
a 
seat 
at 
an 
open 
place 
and 
looked ScrEv_spend_time_bus
out 
the 
window 
. 
the 
store 
i 
was 
going UnrelEv_bus
to 
was UnrelEv_bus
only 
a 
few 
stops 
away 
and 
when 
i 
saw UnrelEv_bus
we 
were UnrelEv_bus
close 
, 
i 
pulled ScrEv_press_stop_button
the 
cord 
to 
signal RelNScrEv_bus
to 
the 
driver 
i 
was 
ready UnrelEv_bus
to 
get+off ScrEv_get_off
. 
he 
stopped ScrEv_bus_stops
at 
the 
shopping 
center 
and 
i 
thanked RelNScrEv_bus
him 
for 
the 
ride 
as 
i 
stepped ScrEv_get_off
onto 
the 
pavement 
. 
<end_of_story>_bus 
yesterday 
, 
i 
went+to+the+bus+stop Evoking_bus
. 
i 
waited ScrEv_wait
for 
the 
bus 
with 
a 
few 
others 
. 
the 
bus 
arrived ScrEv_bus_comes
. 
when 
i 
got+on ScrEv_board_bus
, 
i 
scanned ScrEv_get_ticket
my 
bus 
pass 
on 
the 
bus 
pass 
scanner 
and 
then 
took ScrEv_find_place
my 
seat 
. 
the 
bus 
was UnrelEv_bus
not 
crowded RelNScrEv_bus
, 
so 
i 
was 
able 
to 
take ScrEv_find_place
a 
seat 
near 
the 
front 
. 
i 
sat ScrEv_spend_time_bus
quietly 
, 
playing ScrEv_spend_time_bus
with 
my 
cellphone 
. 
others 
stared UnrelEv_bus
around 
or 
talked UnrelEv_bus
quietly 
amongst 
themselves 
. 
a 
bell 
rang ScrEv_other_bus
every 
few 
blocks 
to 
indicate UnrelEv_bus
someone 
wanting UnrelEv_bus
to 
get+off ScrEv_get_off
. 
the 
bus 
would 
stop ScrEv_bus_stops
, 
let ScrEv_get_off
people 
off 
, 
and 
let ScrEv_board_bus
new 
people 
on 
. 
the 
bus 
started UnrelEv_bus
to 
get UnrelEv_bus
crowded RelNScrEv_bus
so 
i 
offered ScrEv_other_bus
my 
seat 
to 
an 
older 
woman 
. 
she 
thanked UnrelEv_bus
me 
for 
the 
polite 
etiquette 
. 
i 
saw UnrelEv_bus
my 
stop 
coming ScrEv_other_bus
up 
, 
so 
i 
pulled ScrEv_press_stop_button
the 
lever 
and 
the 
bell 
rang ScrEv_other_bus
again 
. 
the 
bus 
stopped ScrEv_bus_stops
a 
few 
moments 
later 
. 
i 
thanked RelNScrEv_bus
the 
bus 
driver 
for 
his 
services 
and 
exited ScrEv_get_off
the 
bus 
. 
<end_of_story>_bus 
i 
took+a+public+bus Evoking_bus
to 
get UnrelEv_bus
the 
work 
this 
morning 
. 
at 
around 
523 
am 
, 
i 
left UnrelEv_bus
my 
apartment 
and 
walked ScrEv_get_bus_stop
to 
the 
nearest 
bus 
stop 
which 
was UnrelEv_bus
about 
a 
523 
minute 
walk 
from 
home 
. 
once 
i 
got ScrEv_get_bus_stop
there 
, 
i 
waited ScrEv_wait
for 
the 
bus 
to 
arrive RelNScrEv_bus
along 
with 
two 
other 
people 
. 
after 
about 
523 
minutes 
, 
an 
express 
bus 
heading RelNScrEv_bus
to 
manhattan 
arrived ScrEv_bus_comes
. 
i 
boarded ScrEv_board_bus
the 
bus 
and 
paid ScrEv_get_ticket
the 
driver 
my 
fare 
. 
i 
then 
walked ScrEv_find_place
to 
a 
window 
seat 
near 
the 
front 
of 
the 
bus 
, 
that 
was UnrelEv_bus
free 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_bus
pretty 
early 
, 
and 
the 
bus 
was UnrelEv_bus
initially 
somewhat 
empty 
. 
however 
, 
several 
stops 
later 
, 
the 
bus 
was UnrelEv_bus
filled RelNScrEv_bus
with 
fellow 
commuters 
heading UnrelEv_bus
to 
work 
. 
along 
the 
way 
, 
the 
bus 
passed ScrEv_other_bus
through 
about 
523 
different 
towns 
while 
traveling RelNScrEv_bus
on 
local 
roads 
, 
before 
headed RelNScrEv_bus
out 
to 
the 
george 
washington 
bridge 
to 
get+to RelNScrEv_bus
manhattan 
. 
while 
getting RelNScrEv_bus
there 
, 
the 
bus 
ran+into RelNScrEv_bus
a 
traffic 
jam 
which 
caused UnrelEv_bus
a 
523 
minute 
delay 
. 
after 
working RelNScrEv_bus
its 
way 
through 
traffic 
, 
the 
bus 
made+it RelNScrEv_bus
onto 
the 
bridge 
, 
and 
several 
minutes 
later 
, 
we 
were ScrEv_other_bus
at 
the 
bus 
terminal 
on 
178th 
street 
. 
once 
we 
got ScrEv_other_bus
there 
, 
the 
bus 
stopped ScrEv_bus_stops
and 
the 
driver 
let ScrEv_get_off
us 
out 
, 
whereby 
i 
then 
walked UnrelEv_bus
to 
the 
office 
. 
<end_of_story>_bus 
my 
car 
is UnrelEv_bus
in 
the 
repair 
shop 
so 
i 
had 
to 
take+the+bus Evoking_bus
to 
work 
yesterday 
. 
the 
first 
thing 
i 
did+was UnrelEv_bus
walk ScrEv_get_bus_stop
to 
the 
bus 
stop 
at 
the 
corner 
and 
then 
waited ScrEv_wait
for 
the 
bus 
to 
arrive ScrEv_bus_comes
. 
i 
watched ScrEv_other_bus
the 
signs 
on 
the 
front 
of 
the 
buses 
as 
they 
approached UnrelEv_bus
so 
i 
would 
know UnrelEv_bus
which 
one 
to 
take RelNScrEv_bus
. 
when 
i 
saw UnrelEv_bus
the 
right 
one 
, 
i 
stood+up ScrEv_other_bus
so 
the 
driver 
would 
know UnrelEv_bus
i 
want 
to 
ride ScrEv_ride
. 
the 
bus 
stopped ScrEv_bus_stops
and 
then 
the 
door 
opened ScrEv_door_opens
. 
i 
climbed ScrEv_board_bus
the 
steps 
and 
the 
bus 
driver 
said RelNScrEv_bus
hello 
. 
you 
can 
buy RelNScrEv_bus
a 
bus 
pass 
if 
you 
ride ScrEv_ride
the 
bus 
a 
lot 
, 
but 
i 
do UnrelEv_bus
n't 
so 
i 
do 
n't 
have UnrelEv_bus
a 
pass 
. 
instead 
, 
i 
put ScrEv_get_ticket
coins 
into 
the 
money 
receiver 
beside 
the 
bus 
driver 
and 
then 
i 
walked ScrEv_other_bus
to 
where 
the 
seats 
are 
. 
the 
bus 
was UnrelEv_bus
only 
about 
half 
full 
, 
so 
i 
chose ScrEv_find_place
a 
seat 
by 
myself 
and 
sat+down ScrEv_find_place
by 
the 
window 
. 
once 
the 
bus 
started ScrEv_other_bus
again 
, 
there 
was UnrelEv_bus
a 
little 
jerking 
motion 
as 
it 
moved+forward ScrEv_ride
and 
then 
we 
were 
rolling+down ScrEv_ride
the 
street 
. 
while 
i 
was 
sitting ScrEv_spend_time_bus
, 
i 
did 
n't 
touch ScrEv_spend_time_bus
anything 
in 
case 
it 
was 
dirty 
. 
instead 
, 
i 
kept ScrEv_spend_time_bus
my 
hands 
in 
my 
lap 
and 
watched ScrEv_spend_time_bus
people 
, 
cars 
and 
buildings 
out 
of 
the 
window 
. 
a 
nice 
lady 
in 
the 
seat 
across 
from 
me 
smiled UnrelEv_bus
at 
me 
, 
but 
no 
one 
else 
paid UnrelEv_bus
attention 
to 
me 
and 
when 
the 
bus

<end_of_story>_bus 
i 
ride+the+bus Evoking_bus
almost 
every 
day 
, 
and 
yesterday 
was UnrelEv_bus
no 
exception 
. 
i 
was 
taking UnrelEv_bus
a 
trip 
to 
a 
donation 
center 
to 
drop+off UnrelEv_bus
some 
items 
. 
before 
i 
went+out ScrEv_get_bus_stop
to 
the 
bus 
stop 
, 
i 
checked ScrEv_other_bus
my 
phone 
for 
schedules 
and 
live 
info 
on 
where 
the 
bus 
is UnrelEv_bus
so 
i 
could 
spend UnrelEv_bus
the 
least 
amount 
of 
time 
waiting ScrEv_wait
for 
the 
bus 
. 
once 
it 
was UnrelEv_bus
time 
, 
i 
ran+out ScrEv_get_bus_stop
to 
the 
bus 
stop 
with 
my 
wallet 
and 
my 
bus 
card 
- 
a 
pass 
containing 
all 
the 
fare 
money 
i 
use RelNScrEv_bus
electronically 
. 
once 
i 
was ScrEv_board_bus
on 
the 
bus 
, 
i 
scanned ScrEv_get_ticket
my 
pass 
, 
looked ScrEv_find_place
for 
an 
open 
seat 
, 
and 
sat+down ScrEv_find_place
. 
when 
my 
stop 
was RelNScrEv_bus
nearby 
, 
i 
pulled ScrEv_press_stop_button
a 
cord 
that 
made ScrEv_other_bus
a 
signal 
on 
the 
bus 
to 
let UnrelEv_bus
the 
driver 
know UnrelEv_bus
i 
needed 
him 
to 
stop ScrEv_bus_stops
there 
. 
i 
gathered ScrEv_other_bus
my 
belongings 
and 
got+off ScrEv_get_off
the 
bus 
, 
using RelNScrEv_bus
the 
rear 
exit 
so 
i 
do 
n't 
bump+into UnrelEv_bus
anyone 
who 
might 
be 
boarding RelNScrEv_bus
in 
front 
. 
<end_of_story>_bus 
this 
morning 
i 
rode+a+public+bus Evoking_bus
to 
college 
. 
before 
i 
left UnrelEv_bus
my 
house 
, 
i 
checked ScrEv_other_bus
the 
bus 
schedule 
so 
i 
would 
know UnrelEv_bus
what 
time 
the 
bus 
was 
meant+to UnrelEv_bus
arrive ScrEv_bus_comes
. 
i 
then 
left UnrelEv_bus
my 
house 
and 
walked+to ScrEv_get_bus_stop
the 
bus 
stop 
right 
outside 
my 
house 
. 
i 
then 
sat UnrelEv_bus
on 
the 
bench 
next 
to 
an 
old 
man 
and 
waited ScrEv_wait
for 
the 
bus 
to 
arrive ScrEv_bus_comes
. 
while 
i 
waited ScrEv_wait
, 
i 
chatted UnrelEv_bus
with 
the 
old 
man 
. 
when 
the 
bus 
arrived ScrEv_bus_comes
, 
i 
let UnrelEv_bus
the 
old 
man 
get+on ScrEv_board_bus
in 
front 
of 
me 
. 
i 
then 
climbed ScrEv_board_bus
on 
board 
the 
bus 
, 
paid ScrEv_get_ticket
the 
bus 
driver 
the 
bus 
fare 
, 
and 
the 
bus 
driver 
said RelNScrEv_bus
'' 
`` 
good 
morning 
'' 
'' 
as 
he 
handed ScrEv_other_bus
me 
my 
ticket 
. 
holding+onto UnrelEv_bus
my 
ticket 
, 
i 
took ScrEv_find_place
a 
seat 
near 
the 
front 
of 
the 
bus 
. 
i 
stared+out ScrEv_spend_time_bus
the 
window 
throughout 
the 
bus 
journey 
, 
just 
enjoying ScrEv_spend_time_bus
the 
view 
. 
when 
my 
stop 
was 
coming+up ScrEv_other_bus
, 
i 
pressed ScrEv_press_stop_button
the 
button 
to 
let UnrelEv_bus
the 
bus 
driver 
know UnrelEv_bus
to 
stop ScrEv_bus_stops
the

. 
he 
stopped ScrEv_bus_stops
at 
my 
stop 
and 
i 
stood+up ScrEv_other_bus
and 
got+off ScrEv_get_off
the 
bus 
, 
thanking RelNScrEv_bus
the 
bus 
driver 
before 
i 
exited ScrEv_get_off
. 
<end_of_story>_bus 
i 
was 
walking UnrelEv_bus
to 
my 
car 
last 
night 
from 
work 
and 
was UnrelEv_bus
ready 
to 
drive UnrelEv_bus
home 
. 
i 
started UnrelEv_bus
the 
car 
up 
, 
but 
i 
noticed UnrelEv_bus
that 
i 
left UnrelEv_bus
my 
phone 
at 
work 
, 
so 
i 
turned UnrelEv_bus
the 
ignition 
back 
off 
, 
locked UnrelEv_bus
the 
car 
doors 
, 
and 
shut UnrelEv_bus
the 
driver 
door 
. 
unfortunately 
for 
me 
, 
i 
shut UnrelEv_bus
the 
door 
with 
my 
keys 
still 
in 
the 
ignition 
. 
that 
's UnrelEv_bus
right 
; 
i 
was+locked+out UnrelEv_bus
of 
my 
own 
car 
. 
flustered UnrelEv_bus
and 
embarassed UnrelEv_bus
, 
i 
pulled UnrelEv_bus
at 
the 
handles 
of 
the 
doors 
and 
attempted UnrelEv_bus
to 
open UnrelEv_bus
the 
trunk 
off 
the 
car 
- 
no 
luck 
at 
all 
. 
i 
walked UnrelEv_bus
back 
to 
my 
office 
, 
got UnrelEv_bus
my 
phone 
, 
and 
contemplated UnrelEv_bus
what 
i 
would 
do UnrelEv_bus
next 
. 
there 
was UnrelEv_bus
no 
one 
there 
with 
me 
, 
so 
my 
only 
hope 
was 
riding+the+public+bus Evoking_bus
-lrb- 
i 
did 
n't 
have UnrelEv_bus
money 
for 
a 
cab 
-rrb- 
. 
i 
waited+for ScrEv_wait
the 
bus 
, 
the 
last 
one 
of 
the 
night 
, 
at 
the 
bus 
stop 
. 
the 
bus 
driver 
opened ScrEv_door_opens
the 
door 
for 
me 
and 
i 
came+aboard ScrEv_board_bus
. 
i 
paid ScrEv_get_ticket
the 
two 
dollar 
bus 
fare 
so 
that 
i 
could 
ride ScrEv_ride
and 
asked RelNScrEv_bus
him 
for 
a 
transfer 
so 
that 
i 
could 
get+on ScrEv_change_bus
the 
next 
bus 
at 
the 
terminal 
. 
i 
took ScrEv_find_place
my 
seat 
, 
and 
the 
bus 
took RelNScrEv_bus
me 
to 
the 
terminal 
at 
the 
plaza 
. 
i 
got+off ScrEv_change_bus
the 
bus 
and 
hopped+on ScrEv_change_bus
the 
bus 
that 
would 
take 
me 
home 
. 
i 
handed ScrEv_other_bus
the 
transfer 
to 
the 
driver 
and 
took 
my 
seat 
. 
as 
i 
approached UnrelEv_bus
my 
apartment 
, 
i 
pushed ScrEv_press_stop_button
the 
button 
to 
request UnrelEv_bus
for 
the 
bus 
to 
stop ScrEv_bus_stops
. 
the 
driver 
pulled+over ScrEv_bus_stops
, 
and 
i 
thanked RelNScrEv_bus
them 
and 
got+off ScrEv_get_off
. 
when 
i 
got UnrelEv_bus
in 
the 
apartment 
, 
i 
immediately 
jumped UnrelEv_bus
into 
my 
bed 
. 
i 
was UnrelEv_bus
dead-tired 
, 
and 
though 
i 
had UnrelEv_bus
the 
dilemma 
of 
having UnrelEv_bus
my 
keys 
locked UnrelEv_bus
in 
the 
car 
, 
i 
would 
figure UnrelEv_bus
that 
out 
in 
the 
morning 
. 
<end_of_story>_bus 
after 
looking+for+a+bus+route Evoking_bus
to 
my 
workplace 
online 
, 
i 
headed ScrEv_get_bus_stop
outside 
. 
the 
nearest 
bus 
stop 
was UnrelEv_bus
only 
about 
a 
block 
or 
two 
away 
so 
i 
walked+over ScrEv_get_bus_stop
. 
there 
were UnrelEv_bus
two 
bus 
stops 
at 
the 
same 
intersection 
, 
one 
on 
either 
side 
of 
the 
road 
. 
i 
made+sure UnrelEv_bus
i 
was UnrelEv_bus
at 
the 
right 
stop 
by 
reading RelNScrEv_bus
the 
stop 
location 
id 
listed RelNScrEv_bus
on 
the 
sign 
next 
to 
the 
bus 
stop 
. 
my 
bus 
arrived ScrEv_bus_comes
in 
about 
five 
minutes 
and 
i 
got ScrEv_board_bus
on 
board 
. 
i 
waited ScrEv_wait
until 
i 
got UnrelEv_bus
to 
the 
rider 
before 
taking+out RelNScrEv_bus
my 
wallet 
, 
and 
quickly 
paid ScrEv_get_ticket
the 
exact 
fee 
for 
a 
one 
day 
, 
unlimited 
bus 
pass 
. 
after 
receiving ScrEv_get_ticket
the 
pass 
, 
i 
walked ScrEv_other_bus
inside 
the 
bus 
and 
looked+for ScrEv_find_place
the 
nearest 
, 
open 
seat 
. 
i 
found ScrEv_find_place
one 
close 
to 
the 
back 
of 
the 
bus 
. 
since 
my 
stop 
was UnrelEv_bus
a 
common 
one 
, 
i 
did 
n't 
have 
to 
let RelNScrEv_bus
the 
bus 
driver 
know UnrelEv_bus
when 
i 
needed 
to 
get+off RelNScrEv_bus
. 
once 
we 
arrived ScrEv_other_bus
at 
my 
stop 
, 
me 
and 
several 
others 
all 
got+off ScrEv_get_off
and 
went UnrelEv_bus
our 
separate 
ways 
. 
<end_of_story>_bus 
this 
past 
weekend 
i 
rode+a+public+bus Evoking_bus
. 
i 
was UnrelEv_bus
in 
a 
busy 
city 
and 
needed 
to 
get+to RelNScrEv_bus
a 
tour 
bus 
. 
after 
getting+of UnrelEv_bus
the 
train 
system 
i 
was 
directed ScrEv_get_bus_stop
to 
the 
city 
bus 
. 
i 
noticed UnrelEv_bus
a 
section 
of 
the 
block 
where 
a 
lot 
of 
people 
were 
standing+around RelNScrEv_bus
and 
the 
bus 
would 
stop ScrEv_bus_stops
in 
this 
area 
to 
put+up ScrEv_board_bus
passengers 
. 
there 
was UnrelEv_bus
but 
after 
bus 
after 
bus 
and 
you 
had 
to 
move UnrelEv_bus
fast 
. 
i 
was 
told UnrelEv_bus
that 
number 
523 
was UnrelEv_bus
my 
bus 
. 
so 
when 
i 
saw UnrelEv_bus
it 
pull+up ScrEv_bus_comes
i 
had 
to 
push+through ScrEv_other_bus
the 
crowd 
so 
that 
i 
could 
board ScrEv_board_bus
my 
bus 
. 
i 
was 
able 
to 
get+on ScrEv_board_bus
and 
the 
bus 
captain 
came+over RelNScrEv_bus
to 
me 
after 
a 
minute 
or 
so 
and 
collected ScrEv_get_ticket
my 
fair 
. 
as 
i 
sat+back ScrEv_spend_time_bus
to 
relaxed ScrEv_spend_time_bus
i 
noticed UnrelEv_bus
that 
the 
bus 
driver 
was 
driving RelNScrEv_bus
the 
bus 
with 
wild 
abandon 
. 
he 
was+flying UnrelEv_bus
through 
the 
street 
and 
than 
squealing RelNScrEv_bus
the 
brakes 
as 
he 
tried UnrelEv_bus
to 
keep RelNScrEv_bus
control 
of 
the 
vehicle 
. 
i 
just 
knew UnrelEv_bus
we 
were 
all 
going 
to 
die UnrelEv_bus
. 
i 
was 
trying UnrelEv_bus
to 
get UnrelEv_bus
my 
friends 
attention 
but 
she 
was+turned+around UnrelEv_bus
and 
deep 
in 
a 
conversation 
. 
this 
was UnrelEv_bus
a 
nerve 
racking 
situation 
not 
only 
because 
of 
his 
driving RelNScrEv_bus
but 
i 
did 
n't 
really 
know UnrelEv_bus
my 
stop 
so 
i 
was 
tried UnrelEv_bus
to 
calm UnrelEv_bus
my 
heart 
as 
we 
nearly 
missed UnrelEv_bus
car 
after 
car 
and 
look+our ScrEv_spend_time_bus
the 
window 
to 
determine UnrelEv_bus
where 
the 
tour 
bus 
company 
was 
located UnrelEv_bus
. 
it 
finally 
worked+out UnrelEv_bus
because 
a 
few 
of 
the 
passengers 
was 
going RelNScrEv_bus
to 
same 
place 
and 
directed RelNScrEv_bus
me 
to 
get+off ScrEv_get_off
at 
the 
right 
location 
. 
they 
were UnrelEv_bus
so 
nice 
and 
i 
was UnrelEv_bus
able 
to 
speak UnrelEv_bus
with 
a 
few 
of 
them 
. 
so 
, 
i 
guess UnrelEv_bus
i 
can 
say UnrelEv_bus
it 
was UnrelEv_bus
n't 
all 
bad 
because 
i 
made UnrelEv_bus
a 
friend 
or 
two 
with 
some 
of 
the 
passengers 
and 
i 
made+it RelNScrEv_bus
to 
my 
tour 
bus 
location 
in 
plenty 
of 
time 
for 
my 
trip 
home 
. 
<end_of_story>_bus 
i 
live UnrelEv_bus
in 
a 
large 
city 
, 
and 
while 
i 
do 
have UnrelEv_bus
a 
car 
, 
sometimes 
there 
is UnrelEv_bus
a 
lack 
of 
parking UnrelEv_bus
where 
i 
need 
to 
go UnrelEv_bus
. 
when 
this 
happens UnrelEv_bus
or 
if 
i 
think UnrelEv_bus
it 
will 
be UnrelEv_bus
hard 
to 
park UnrelEv_bus
, 
i 
will 
take+the+city+bus Evoking_bus
. 
they 
have RelNScrEv_bus
a 
very 
good 
bus 
service 
in 
our 
city 
, 
and 
you 
can 
get RelNScrEv_bus
wherever 
you 
need 
to 
be UnrelEv_bus
fairly 
easily 
and 
quickly 
. 
i 
know UnrelEv_bus
riding+the+bus Evoking_bus
can 
be UnrelEv_bus
confusing 
at 
first 
, 
but 
they 
make RelNScrEv_bus
some 
very 
easy 
bus 
schedules 
to 
help UnrelEv_bus
people 
. 
i 
knew UnrelEv_bus
where 
i 
needed 
to 
go UnrelEv_bus
, 
so 
i 
took+out ScrEv_other_bus
my 
bus 
schedule 
and 
found+out ScrEv_other_bus
when 
the 
bus 
i 
needed 
to 
ride ScrEv_ride
would 
be RelNScrEv_bus
at 
the 
stop 
near 
my 
house 
. 
i 
went ScrEv_get_bus_stop
there 
a 
few 
minutes 
early 
, 
and 
right 
on 
time 
, 
i 
saw ScrEv_bus_comes
the 
bus 
i 
needed 
to 
ride RelNScrEv_bus
. 
i 
could 
tell UnrelEv_bus
it 
was UnrelEv_bus
my 
bus 
by 
the 
big 
number 
flashing RelNScrEv_bus
near 
the 
top 
of 
the 
bus 
. 
when 
the 
bus 
stopped ScrEv_bus_comes
, 
i 
got+on ScrEv_board_bus
and 
put ScrEv_get_ticket
my 
money 
into 
the 
coin 
taker 
which 
is UnrelEv_bus
near 
the 
driver 
. 
i 
then 
moved ScrEv_other_bus
to 
the 
back 
of 
the 
bus 
and 
chose ScrEv_find_place
a 
seat 
. 
a 
nice 
woman 
was 
sitting UnrelEv_bus
across 
from 
me 
and 
she 
smiled ScrEv_spend_time_bus
and 
said ScrEv_spend_time_bus
hello 
. 
i 
smiled ScrEv_spend_time_bus
and 
said ScrEv_spend_time_bus
hello 
in 
return 
. 
people 
are UnrelEv_bus
usually 
very 
friendly 
on 
the 
bus 
. 
i 
rode ScrEv_ride
the 
bus 
for 
several 
more 
stops 
, 
and 
then 
saw UnrelEv_bus
my 
stop 
coming+up ScrEv_other_bus
. 
when 
the 
bus 
stopped ScrEv_bus_stops
, 
i 
got+off ScrEv_get_off
the 
bus 
and 
went UnrelEv_bus
to 
my 
destination 
. 
it 
is UnrelEv_bus
very 
easy 
and 
convenient 
to 
ride+the+public+bus Evoking_bus
. 
<end_of_story>_bus 
the 
other 
day 
i 
decided UnrelEv_bus
not 
to 
drive UnrelEv_bus
into 
the 
city 
like 
i 
usually 
do UnrelEv_bus
, 
but 
to 
take+the+bus Evoking_bus
instead 
. 
even 
though 
it 
is UnrelEv_bus
a 
ten 
minute 
walk 
from 
my 
house 
to 
the 
bus 
stop 
, 
it 
is UnrelEv_bus
still 
much 
more 
relaxing UnrelEv_bus
to 
travel+by+public+bus Evoking_bus
instead 
of 
getting+stressed+driving UnrelEv_bus
in 
traffic 
in 
the 
city 
. 
i 
walked ScrEv_get_bus_stop
in 
the 
sunshine 
to 
the 
bus 
stop 
where 
lots 
of 
other 
people 
were 
already 
waiting ScrEv_wait
for 
the 
bus 
, 
some 
of 
them 
were 
reading RelNScrEv_bus
the 
bus 
timetable 
attached UnrelEv_bus
to 
the 
covered UnrelEv_bus
bus 
stop 
. 
there 
was UnrelEv_bus
no 
space 
on 
the 
bench 
so 
i 
just 
stood ScrEv_other_bus
in 
line 
and 
waited ScrEv_wait
until 
i 
saw UnrelEv_bus
the 
big 
red 
double 
decker 
bus 
turn ScrEv_bus_comes
the 
corner 
and 
head ScrEv_bus_comes
towards 
us 
. 
when 
the 
driver 
pulled+up ScrEv_bus_comes
at 
the 
curb 
, 
people 
started UnrelEv_bus
to 
board ScrEv_board_bus
the 
bus 
, 
it 
took UnrelEv_bus
a 
while 
as 
each 
of 
them 
had 
to 
stop UnrelEv_bus
to 
pay ScrEv_get_ticket
the 
driver 
before 
finding ScrEv_find_place
a 
seat 
but 
eventually 
it 
was UnrelEv_bus
my 
turn 
to 
get ScrEv_board_bus
on 
board 
. 
i 
told RelNScrEv_bus
the 
driver 
where 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_bus
to 
get+off ScrEv_get_off
the 
bus 
and 
that 
i 
needed RelNScrEv_bus
a 
return 
fare 
as 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_bus
to 
come UnrelEv_bus
home 
later 
. 
i 
found UnrelEv_bus
the 
correct 
change 
to 
hand ScrEv_get_ticket
to 
the 
driver 
and 
he 
punched RelNScrEv_bus
some 
buttons 
on 
a 
machine 
at 
the 
side 
of 
the 
steering 
wheel 
. 
the 
machine 
printed RelNScrEv_bus
a 
ticket 
which 
he 
gave ScrEv_get_ticket
to 
me 
and 
said UnrelEv_bus
i 
would 
have 
to 
keep UnrelEv_bus
safe 
to 
hand+in RelNScrEv_bus
on 
the 
return 
bus 
journey 
. 
i 
decided UnrelEv_bus
to 
sit UnrelEv_bus
upstairs 
as 
the 
view 
of 
the 
countryside 
is 
always 
better 
from 
higher 
up 
, 
and 
climbed ScrEv_other_bus
the 
little 
spiral 
staircase 
up 
to 
the 
top 
deck 
where 
i 
found ScrEv_find_place
an 
empty 
seat 
. 
the 
journey 
was UnrelEv_bus
noisy 
, 
lots 
of 
people 
were 
talking UnrelEv_bus
and 
laughing UnrelEv_bus
and 
it 
took RelNScrEv_bus
a 
lot 
longer 
than 
if 
i 
was 
driving UnrelEv_bus
as 
the 
bus 
stopped ScrEv_bus_stops
in 
various 
villages 
along 
the 
way 
. 
by 
the 
time 
i 
got+to ScrEv_other_bus
the 
city 
and 
left ScrEv_get_off
the 
bus 
, 
i 
was UnrelEv_bus
relaxed 
and 
happy 
and 
looking+forward+to+doing UnrelEv_bus
some 
shopping UnrelEv_bus
. 
<end_of_story>_bus 
needing 
to 
go UnrelEv_bus
across 
town 
, 
i 
decided UnrelEv_bus
to 
take+a+public+bus Evoking_bus
rather 
than 
drive UnrelEv_bus
. 
i 
had UnrelEv_bus
no 
bus 
tokens 
to 
pay RelNScrEv_bus
for 
the 
fare 
so 
i 
walked ScrEv_get_bus_stop
to 
the 
bus 
station 
downtown 
and 
bought ScrEv_get_ticket
some 
. 
then 
i 
got ScrEv_other_bus
a 
bus 
schedule 
and 
looked+for ScrEv_other_bus
a 
bus 
that 
was 
going RelNScrEv_bus
across 
town 
. 
i 
would 
be 
riding RelNScrEv_bus
bus 
number 
523 
. 
so 
i 
went+out ScrEv_get_bus_stop
to 
the 
platform 
where 
a 
lot 
of 
other 
people 
were 
waiting ScrEv_wait
for 
their 
buses 
. 
i 
found UnrelEv_bus
where 
number 
523 
stopped 
and 
got ScrEv_other_bus
in 
the 
line 
. 
when 
the 
bus 
came ScrEv_bus_comes
i 
had UnrelEv_bus
my 
token 
out 
and 
ready 
to 
deposit RelNScrEv_bus
in 
the 
fare 
collection 
box 
. 
then 
i 
went UnrelEv_bus
and 
found ScrEv_find_place
a 
seat 
. 
i 
was 
going 
to 
sit ScrEv_find_place
next 
to 
a 
woman 
that 
looked UnrelEv_bus
like 
she 
was 
going UnrelEv_bus
to 
work 
. 
the 
bus 
meandered RelNScrEv_bus
through 
the 
city 
and 
finally 
got RelNScrEv_bus
me 
to 
my 
destination 
. 
<end_of_story>_bus 
my 
car 
had 
broken+down UnrelEv_bus
so 
i 
needed 
to 
take+the+public+bus Evoking_bus
to 
work 
on 
wednesday 
morning 
. 
first 
i 
looked ScrEv_other_bus
on-line 
to 
see UnrelEv_bus
which 
bus 
i 
should 
take RelNScrEv_bus
to 
get RelNScrEv_bus
to 
mclean 
, 
and 
what 
bus 
stop 
was RelNScrEv_bus
the 
closest 
to 
my 
home 
. 
the 
instructions 
were UnrelEv_bus
to 
go RelNScrEv_bus
to 
seven 
corners 
shopping 
center 
, 
catch ScrEv_board_bus
the 
3a 
to 
tyson 
corner 
, 
and 
then 
transfer ScrEv_change_bus
to 
the 
18a 
to 
get RelNScrEv_bus
within 
a 
block 
of 
my 
office 
. 
in 
the 
morning 
i 
walked+up ScrEv_get_bus_stop
to 
the 
shopping 
center 
and 
waited ScrEv_wait
until 
the 
bus 
came ScrEv_bus_comes
. 
i 
got+on ScrEv_board_bus
, 
paying ScrEv_get_ticket
the 
driver 
with 
change 
and 
dollar 
bills 
. 
i 
confirmed RelNScrEv_bus
with 
the 
driver 
that 
this 
was UnrelEv_bus
the 
correct 
bus 
to 
go RelNScrEv_bus
to 
tyson 
corner 
and 
transfer RelNScrEv_bus
. 
i 
chose ScrEv_find_place
a 
seat 
near 
the 
front 
so 
i 
could 
make+sure UnrelEv_bus
i 
did 
not 
miss RelNScrEv_bus
my 
next 
stop 
. 
i 
transferred ScrEv_change_bus
at 
tyson 
corner 
to 
the 
18a 
, 
which 
took RelNScrEv_bus
me 
within 
a 
block 
of 
my 
work 
place 
. 
<end_of_story>_bus 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_bus
to 
go UnrelEv_bus
the 
museum 
downtown 
milwaukee 
. 
i 
got UnrelEv_bus
ten 
dollars 
from 
my 
bank 
and 
put UnrelEv_bus
in 
my 
pocket 
. 
i 
walked ScrEv_get_bus_stop
a 
block 
from 
my 
house 
to 
catch+the+bus Evoking_bus
. 
the 
number 
nine 
bus 
came ScrEv_bus_comes
ten 
minutes 
later 
. 
i 
boarded ScrEv_board_bus
the 
bus 
and 
asked RelNScrEv_bus
the 
driver 
" 
how 
much 
? 
" 
the 
driver 
asked RelNScrEv_bus
me 
where 
i 
was 
going UnrelEv_bus
and 
when 
i 
told RelNScrEv_bus
him 
he 
said RelNScrEv_bus
" 
that 
ll 
be RelNScrEv_bus
two 
seventy 
five 
. 
" 
i 
pulled ScrEv_other_bus
three 
dollars 
out 
of 
my 
pocket 
and 
put ScrEv_get_ticket
them 
in 
the 
bus 
money 
collection 
machine 
. 
the 
machine 
showed RelNScrEv_bus
three 
dollars 
were 
entered UnrelEv_bus
and 
that 
my 
ride 
would 
cost RelNScrEv_bus
two 
seventy 
five 
. 
a 
quarter 
dropped UnrelEv_bus
in 
the 
drop 
box 
. 
i 
retrieved UnrelEv_bus
the 
quarter 
and 
then 
found ScrEv_find_place
a 
seat 
. 
the 
bus 
driver 
told RelNScrEv_bus
i 
had UnrelEv_bus
ten 
stops 
before 
mine 
so 
i 
started UnrelEv_bus
counting RelNScrEv_bus
stops 
. 
the 
first 
stop 
was ScrEv_bus_stops
fifth 
street 
. 
the 
second 
was ScrEv_bus_stops
hadley 
avenue 
. 
the 
next 
stop 
was ScrEv_bus_stops
dobson 
. 
adams 
was ScrEv_bus_stops
the 
ninth 
stop 
. 
finally 
, 
main 
street 
came+up RelNScrEv_bus
. 
i 
pulled ScrEv_press_stop_button
the 
bus 
s 
rider 
cord 
to 
let RelNScrEv_bus
the 
bus 
driver 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_bus
to 
get+off ScrEv_get_off
. 
the 
bus 
let ScrEv_get_off
me 
off 
in 
the 
front 
of 
the 
milwaukee 
public 
museum 
. 
i 
spent UnrelEv_bus
almost 
the 
whole 
day 
there 
and 
then 
returned UnrelEv_bus
home 
the 
opposite 
way 
i 
came UnrelEv_bus
. 
<end_of_story>_bus 
riding+a+public+bus Evoking_bus
is UnrelEv_bus
a 
good 
way 
to 
get UnrelEv_bus
around 
a 
city 
. 
if 
i 
am 
traveling UnrelEv_bus
in 
a 
big 
city 
, 
i 
think 
it 
's 
easier 
to 
take+the+bus Evoking_bus
than 
depend UnrelEv_bus
on 
my 
car 
. 
in 
chicago 
, 
i 
can 
get RelNScrEv_bus
anywhere 
in 
the 
city 
more 
quickly 
and 
inexpensively 
using RelNScrEv_bus
public 
transit 
. 
first 
, 
i 
look ScrEv_other_bus
online 
to 
find RelNScrEv_bus
the 
stop 
nearest 
to 
where 
my 
hotel 
is UnrelEv_bus
. 
then 
i 
plan ScrEv_other_bus
out 
the 
stops 
i 
want 
to 
make UnrelEv_bus
. 
maybe 
i 
am 
going UnrelEv_bus
to 
a 
museum 
or 
the 
zoo 
. 
i 
find ScrEv_other_bus
the 
bus 
routes 
that 
go RelNScrEv_bus
where 
i 
want 
to 
go UnrelEv_bus
. 
i 
go ScrEv_get_bus_stop
to 
the 
bus 
stop 
and 
wait ScrEv_wait
for 
the 
bus 
to 
come ScrEv_bus_comes
along 
. 
then 
i 
hop+on ScrEv_board_bus
and 
pay ScrEv_get_ticket
my 
fare 
. 
i 
like UnrelEv_bus
to 
sit ScrEv_find_place
by 
the 
window 
and 
get ScrEv_spend_time_bus
a 
good 
glimpse 
of 
the 
city 
i 
am UnrelEv_bus
in 
. 
sometimes 
i 
will 
even 
see ScrEv_spend_time_bus
something 
that 
catches UnrelEv_bus
my 
eye 
and 
i 
will 
get+off ScrEv_get_off
before 
i 
planned UnrelEv_bus
! 
when 
it 
's UnrelEv_bus
time 
for 
me 
to 
depart RelNScrEv_bus
, 
i 
pull ScrEv_press_stop_button
the 
cord 
and 
let UnrelEv_bus
the 
driver 
know RelNScrEv_bus
i 
want UnrelEv_bus
to 
get+off ScrEv_get_off
. 
then 
i 
get+off ScrEv_get_off
at 
the 
next 
opportunity 
and 
continue UnrelEv_bus
on 
with 
my 
day 
without 
needing UnrelEv_bus
to 
deal+with+parking UnrelEv_bus
! 
<end_of_story>_bus 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_bus
to 
go UnrelEv_bus
to 
san 
francisco 
from 
my 
home 
in 
san 
jose 
and 
i 
did 
n't 
feel UnrelEv_bus
like 
driving UnrelEv_bus
. 
i 
looked ScrEv_other_bus
online 
and 
found+a+bus+route Evoking_bus
from 
here 
to 
there 
that 
was 
leaving RelNScrEv_bus
in 
just 
about 
523 
minutes 
. 
i 
walked+out ScrEv_get_bus_stop
of 
my 
house 
to 
the 
bus 
stop 
and 
got+on ScrEv_board_bus
it 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_bus
a 
very 
empty 
bus 
and 
i 
stared ScrEv_spend_time_bus
out 
of 
the 
window 
at 
the 
scenery 
. 
the 
bus 
driver 
was UnrelEv_bus
very 
nice 
and 
asked UnrelEv_bus
me 
how 
my 
day 
was 
. 
we 
spoke ScrEv_spend_time_bus
for 
the 
whole 
entire 
ride 
and 
after 
a 
short 
time 
, 
we 
arrived RelNScrEv_bus
into 
san 
francisco 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_bus
very 
pleasant 
not 
having 
to 
drive UnrelEv_bus
and 
it 
was UnrelEv_bus
a 
very 
smooth 
ride 
on 
the 
bus 
. 
luckily 
, 
there 
was UnrelEv_bus
n't 
much 
traffic 
so 
we 
got RelNScrEv_bus
there 
in 
a 
very 
short 
time 
frame 
. 
after 
getting+to RelNScrEv_bus
the 
bus 
stop 
, 
the 
driver 
opened ScrEv_door_opens
his 
doors 
for 
me 
and 
wished RelNScrEv_bus
me 
a 
great 
day 
. 
i 
did RelNScrEv_bus
the 
same 
and 
stepped+off ScrEv_get_off
of 
the 
bus 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_bus
a 
very 
easy 
and 
fun 
experience 
. 
<end_of_story>_bus 
i 
ride+the+bus Evoking_bus
to 
school 
everyday 
. 
i 
live UnrelEv_bus
in 
new 
york 
city 
so 
riding+the+bus Evoking_bus
is UnrelEv_bus
a 
common 
thing 
. 
everyone 
does RelNScrEv_bus
it 
because 
it 
is UnrelEv_bus
convenient 
. 
in 
our 
city 
, 
it 
is UnrelEv_bus
very 
packed 
, 
so 
driving+is UnrelEv_bus
n't 
as 
convenient 
or 
affordable 
. 
parking UnrelEv_bus
is 
expensive 
so 
public 
transportation 
saves RelNScrEv_bus
us 
a 
lot 
of 
money 
. 
every 
morning 
when 
i 
go UnrelEv_bus
to 
school 
, 
i 
wait ScrEv_wait
by 
the 
bus 
stop 
. 
the 
morning 
bus 
comes RelNScrEv_bus
every 
ten 
minutes 
. 
once 
it 
arrives ScrEv_bus_comes
i 
board ScrEv_board_bus
onto 
the 
bus 
and 
i 
insert ScrEv_get_ticket
my 
metro 
card 
. 
the 
metro 
card 
has RelNScrEv_bus
a 
balance 
of 
money 
stored RelNScrEv_bus
inside 
it 
. 
this 
money 
is UnrelEv_bus
subtracted RelNScrEv_bus
from 
the 
balance 
every 
time 
i 
ride RelNScrEv_bus
the 
bus 
and 
insert RelNScrEv_bus
my 
metro 
card 
. 
basically 
the 
metro 
card 
pays RelNScrEv_bus
for 
the 
bus 
ride 
. 
when 
i 
run+out UnrelEv_bus
of 
money 
, 
i 
go+to RelNScrEv_bus
a 
metro 
card 
machine 
and 
put RelNScrEv_bus
more 
money 
into 
my 
balance

is UnrelEv_bus
annoying 
sometimes 
. 
in 
the 
morning 
, 
it 
is RelNScrEv_bus
very 
crowded 
so 
sometimes 
there 
are RelNScrEv_bus
n't 
enough 
seats 
for 
everybody 
. 
this 
means UnrelEv_bus
i 
have 
to 
stand ScrEv_spend_time_bus
while 
holding RelNScrEv_bus
on 
to 
a 
pole 
. 
sometimes 
its 
so 
crowded 
that 
i 
am 
sandwiched UnrelEv_bus
in 
between 
people 
. 
if 
i 
am UnrelEv_bus
lucky 
, 
sometimes 
there 
will 
be RelNScrEv_bus
open 
seats 
. 
otherwise 
, 
i 
have 
to 
stand ScrEv_spend_time_bus
for 
523 
minutes 
.

yesterday 
i 
decided UnrelEv_bus
to 
take+the+bus Evoking_bus
to 
the 
zoo 
. 
i 
walked+over ScrEv_get_bus_stop
to 
the 
bus 
stop 
and 
sat+down UnrelEv_bus
on 
the 
bench 
while 
i 
waited ScrEv_wait
for 
the 
bus 
to 
arrive RelNScrEv_bus
. 
there 
was RelNScrEv_bus
a 
map 
of 
all 
the 
bus 
routes 
at 
the 
stop 
, 
so 
i 
looked ScrEv_other_bus
on 
there 
to 
make+sure UnrelEv_bus
i 
knew UnrelEv_bus
which 
bus 
would 
take RelNScrEv_bus
me 
to 
the 
zoo 
. 
i 
saw UnrelEv_bus
i 
needed UnrelEv_bus
bus 
number 
523 
. 
sure 
enough 
, 
there 
came ScrEv_bus_comes
number 
523 
. 
as 
the 
bus 
pulled+up ScrEv_bus_comes
to 
the 
stop 
, 
the 
driver 
opened ScrEv_door_opens
the 
door 
to 
let ScrEv_get_off
passengers 
off 
. 
once 
everyone 
who 
need UnrelEv_bus
off 
was RelNScrEv_bus
off 
, 
i 
climbed+up ScrEv_board_bus
the 
stairs 
, 
smiled UnrelEv_bus
at 
the 
bus 
driver 
, 
and 
put ScrEv_get_ticket
my 
money 
in 
the 
slot 
. 
i 
took ScrEv_find_place
a 
seat 
and 
off 
we 
went ScrEv_other_bus
. 
i 
watched ScrEv_spend_time_bus
all 
the 
buildings 
go+by UnrelEv_bus
as 
the 
driver 
drove ScrEv_ride
the 
bus 
towards 
the 
zoo 
. 
there 
were RelNScrEv_bus
a 
couple 
of 
other 
stops 
before 
the 
zoo 
, 
and 
at 
each 
one 
people 
got+off RelNScrEv_bus
the 
bus 
and 
on 
the 
bus 
. 
finally 
, 
we 
made+it RelNScrEv_bus
to 
the 
zoo 
. 
the 
driver 
opened+up ScrEv_door_opens
the 
door 
, 
and 
i 
climbed+down ScrEv_get_off
out 
of 
the 
bus 
and 
off 
to 
my 
day 
at 
the 
zoo 
. 
<end_of_story>_bus 
yesterday 
i 
rode+a+public+bus Evoking_bus
to 
go UnrelEv_bus
to 
work 
. 
i 
woke+up UnrelEv_bus
early 
because 
the 
bus 
is UnrelEv_bus
very 
very 
very 
unreliable 
. 
i 
packed UnrelEv_bus
the 
items 
that 
i 
needed UnrelEv_bus
for 
the 
day 
in 
my 
backpack 
. 
i 
double+checked ScrEv_other_bus
to 
make+sure UnrelEv_bus
i 
had UnrelEv_bus
everything 
, 
including UnrelEv_bus
my 
one 
dollar 
and 
twenty 
five 
cents 
bus 
fare 
. 
i 
walked+out ScrEv_get_bus_stop
the 
door 
and 
started UnrelEv_bus
heading ScrEv_get_bus_stop
in 
the 
direction 
of 
the 
bus 
stop 
. 
i 
walked ScrEv_get_bus_stop
to 
the 
bus 
stop 
as 
quickly 
as 
i 
could 
and 
then 
waited ScrEv_wait
for 
the 
bus 
. 
i 
waited ScrEv_wait
about 
ten 
and 
a 
half 
minutes 
before 
the 
bus 
came ScrEv_bus_comes
. 
when 
the 
bus 
arrived ScrEv_bus_comes
i 
got+on ScrEv_board_bus
and 
paid ScrEv_get_ticket
my 
fare 
, 
and 
sat+down ScrEv_find_place
. 
during 
the 
bus 
ride 
i 
listened ScrEv_spend_time_bus
to 
music 
to 
avoid UnrelEv_bus
hearing RelNScrEv_bus
the 
loud 
noise 
of 
the 
bus 
motor 
and 
the 
other 
noises 
caused UnrelEv_bus
by 
the 
large 
number 
of 
people 
around 
me 
. 
finally 
when 
i 
arrived ScrEv_other_bus
at 
the 
destination 
i 
got+off ScrEv_get_off
. 
<end_of_story>_bus 
i 
have 
never 
had 
to 
ride+a+public+bus Evoking_bus
until 
523 
years 
ago 
when 
i 
had UnrelEv_bus
no 
other 
transportation 
and 
was 
forced UnrelEv_bus
to 
take RelNScrEv_bus
a 
public 
bus 
anywhere 
i 
needed 
to 
go UnrelEv_bus
. 
the 
first 
thing 
i 
had 
to 
do UnrelEv_bus
was 
find ScrEv_other_bus
a 
bus 
schedule 
and 
learn UnrelEv_bus
how 
to 
read RelNScrEv_bus
the 
time 
and 
places 
to 
catch RelNScrEv_bus
the 
bus 
and 
how 
to 
make RelNScrEv_bus
any 
needed 
transfers 
. 
this 
was UnrelEv_bus
a 
little 
hard 
to 
do UnrelEv_bus
but 
once 
i 
figured UnrelEv_bus
it 
out 
it 
was UnrelEv_bus
ok 
as 
long 
as 
i 
always 
kept RelNScrEv_bus
a 
schedule 
with 
me 
. 
i 
mostly 
took RelNScrEv_bus
the 
bus 
to 
work 
and 
i 
only 
had 
to 
worry UnrelEv_bus
about 
catching RelNScrEv_bus
one 
bus 
on 
the 
street 
i 
lived UnrelEv_bus
on 
and 
i 
did 
not 
have 
to 
sorry UnrelEv_bus
about 
any 
transfers 
. 
the 
bus 
ride 
cost RelNScrEv_bus
me 
$ 
523 
and 
transfers 
where RelNScrEv_bus
an 
additional 
523 
cents 
. 
many 
people 
rode ScrEv_ride
the 
bus 
and 
i 
meet UnrelEv_bus
several 
nice 
people 
on 
the 
bus 
. 
the 
bus 
drivers 
were UnrelEv_bus
always 
nice 
and 
i 
became UnrelEv_bus
friends 
with 
several 
of 
them 
. 
the 
bus 
only 
came RelNScrEv_bus
once 
an 
hour 
and 
i 
had 
to 
make+sure UnrelEv_bus
i 
did 
not 
miss RelNScrEv_bus
it 
if 
i 
was 
going UnrelEv_bus
to 
work 
because 
then 
i 
would 
be UnrelEv_bus
late 
for 
work 
. 
the 
bus 
always 
made ScrEv_bus_stops
a 
stop 
at 
the 
main 
depot 
in 
order 
to 
pick 
up 
more 
people 
. 
there 
was RelNScrEv_bus
usually 
about 
a 
523 
minute 
wait 
so 
the 
driver 
could 
have RelNScrEv_bus
break 
in 
the 
late 
afternoon 
. 
i 
did 
not 
like UnrelEv_bus
having 
to 
take RelNScrEv_bus
the 
bus 
but 
it 
served RelNScrEv_bus
my 
purpose 
for 
a 
while 
and 
i 
was UnrelEv_bus
thankful 
to 
have 
the 
bus 
available 
. 
<end_of_story>_bus 
tonight 
i 
road+on+a+public+bus Evoking_bus
. 
i 
waited ScrEv_wait
outside 
of 
the 
store 
near 
my 
house 
for 
the 
bus 
which 
runs RelNScrEv_bus
on 
a 
schedule 
. 
once 
the 
bus 
came ScrEv_bus_comes
i 
got 
on 
and 
paid ScrEv_get_ticket
the 
bus 
fare 
. 
after 
that 
i 
took ScrEv_find_place
my 
seat 
i 
looked+around ScrEv_spend_time_bus
at 
all 
the 
other 
people 
. 
when 
you 
ride+on+the+bus Evoking_bus
there 
can 
be UnrelEv_bus
all 
types 
of 
people 
on 
the 
bus 
with 
you 
. 
i 
had UnrelEv_bus
my 
mp3 
player 
with 
me 
with 
ear-buds 
so 
i 
put RelNScrEv_bus
my 
ear-buds 
into 
my 
ears 
and 
turned UnrelEv_bus
on 
my 
mp3 
player 
and 
began UnrelEv_bus
listening ScrEv_spend_time_bus
to 
my 
music 
. 
my 
public 
bus 
ride 
was UnrelEv_bus
n't 
very 
long 
so 
after 
a 
little 
while 
the 
bus 
stopped ScrEv_bus_stops
at 
my 
stop 
and 
i 
got+off ScrEv_get_off
the 
bus 
and 
arrived UnrelEv_bus
at 
my 
destination 
. 
riding+on+a+public+bus Evoking_bus
can 
be UnrelEv_bus
a 
fun 
experience 
if 
you 
want UnrelEv_bus
it 
to 
be UnrelEv_bus
and 
you 
can 
even 
talk UnrelEv_bus
to 
the 
other 
people 
on 
the 
public 
bus 
but 
overall 
i 
had UnrelEv_bus
a 
good 
experience 
. 
<end_of_story>_bus 
i 
live UnrelEv_bus
near 
the 
city 
of 
santa 
cruz 
and 
often 
take+the+17x+bus Evoking_bus
to 
the 
nearby 
city 
of 
san 
jose 
. 
it 
's UnrelEv_bus
possible 
to 
get RelNScrEv_bus
discount 
fares 
by 
paying RelNScrEv_bus
for 
multiple 
rides 
in 
advance 
, 
but 
i 
usually 
pay RelNScrEv_bus
cash 
, 
five 
dollars 
for 
one-way 
. 
i 
get ScrEv_get_bus_stop
to 
my 
small 
town 
's 
transit 
center 
early 
on 
weekday 
mornings 
, 
because 
the 
bus 
fills+up RelNScrEv_bus
quickly 
, 
and 
most 
good 
seats 
are 
already 
taken RelNScrEv_bus
by 
riders 
who 
started UnrelEv_bus
their 
trip 
in 
downtown 
santa 
cruz 
. 
we 
wait ScrEv_wait
in 
line 
in 
civilized 
fashion 
. 
some 
people 
need 
only 
show RelNScrEv_bus
the 
driver 
their 
pass 
, 
some 
shove RelNScrEv_bus
a 
five-dollar 
bill 
into 
the 
fare 
machine 
efficiently 
. 
but 
some 
fumble UnrelEv_bus
with 
small 
coins 
or 
ask RelNScrEv_bus
other 
riders 
for 
change 
, 
which 
makes UnrelEv_bus
everyone 
in 
line 
restive 
. 
once 
on 
, 
riders 
can 
choose ScrEv_find_place
seats 
grouped UnrelEv_bus
around 
small 
tables 
, 
seats 
facing 
forward 
, 
or 
seats 
facing 
sideways 
. 
table 
seats 
are UnrelEv_bus
premium 
, 
since 
the 
bus 
has RelNScrEv_bus
wifi 
and 
many 
people 
bring UnrelEv_bus
laptops 
. 
others 
prefer UnrelEv_bus
seats 
in 
the 
back 
where 
the 
roughnecks 
are UnrelEv_bus
, 
just 
like 
in 
high 
school 
. 
my 
little 
town 
is UnrelEv_bus
the 
last 
stop 
before 
highway 
523 
. 
the 
bus 
whips RelNScrEv_bus
along 
amid 
the 
pine 
trees 
and 
the 
yellow-flowered 
acacia 
that 
blooms UnrelEv_bus
this 
time 
of 
year 
. 
it 
is UnrelEv_bus
pleasant 
not 
to 
have 
to 
keep UnrelEv_bus
your 
eyes 
on 
the 
road 
. 
unspoken UnrelEv_bus
bus 
etiquette 
decrees UnrelEv_bus
that 
strangers 
do 
n't 
speak UnrelEv_bus
to 
each 
other 
, 
but 
of 
course 
some 
people 
know 
each 
other 
and 
chat ScrEv_spend_time_bus
. 
many 
tap+away ScrEv_spend_time_bus
on 
their 
machines 
or 
play ScrEv_spend_time_bus
video 
games 
, 
others 
read ScrEv_spend_time_bus
books 
or 
enjoy ScrEv_spend_time_bus
the 
ride 
. 
it 
ends UnrelEv_bus
at 
san 
jose 
's 
train 
station 
, 
where 
passengers 
can 
transfer ScrEv_change_bus
to 
the 
san 
francisco 
train 
, 
or 
take RelNScrEv_bus
a 
rattling 
inferior 
1-hour 
bus 
ride 
to 
fremont 
to 
catch RelNScrEv_bus
the 
bart 
mass 
transit 
line 
to 
oakland 
, 
richmond 
, 
or 
distant 
pittsburg 
, 
where 
the

<end_of_story>_bus 
there 
is+a+bus+stop Evoking_bus
down 
the 
street 
from 
my

if 
you

it

the

going RelNScrEv_bus
north 
, 
it 
leads+to RelNScrEv_bus
the 
next 
suburban 
town

i 
needed UnrelEv_bus
to 
go UnrelEv_bus
to 
the 
city 
, 
so 
i 
went+to ScrEv_get_bus_stop
the 
bus 
stop 
and 
waited ScrEv_wait
. 
i 
waited ScrEv_wait
about 
ten 
minutes 
and 
then 
the 
bus 
came ScrEv_bus_comes

it 
wheezed ScrEv_bus_stops
to 
a 
stop 
near 
me 
and 
then 
the 
door 
opened ScrEv_door_opens

i 
walked ScrEv_board_bus
into 
the 
bus 
and 
up 
the 
short 
flight 
of 
stairs 
toward 
the 
driver 
. 
i 
had UnrelEv_bus
just 
enough 
change 
on 
me 
to 
pay ScrEv_get_ticket
the 
fare 
. 
i 
fed ScrEv_get_ticket
my 
coins 
into 
the 
slot 
where 
you 
put UnrelEv_bus
your 
money 
and 
then 
walked ScrEv_other_bus
to 
the 
left 
and 
down 
the 
aisle 
to 
find ScrEv_find_place
my 
seat 
. 
i 
passed RelNScrEv_bus
the 
front 
seats 
, 
which 
are 
intended UnrelEv_bus
for 
older 
or 
handicapped 
passengers 
, 
and 
took ScrEv_find_place
a 
seat 
about 
halfway 
down 
the 
bus 
, 
next 
to 
the 
window 
. 
the 
bus 
ride 
lasted RelNScrEv_bus
523 
minutes 
. 
when 
i 
saw UnrelEv_bus
that 
my 
stop 
would 
be RelNScrEv_bus
next 
, 
i 
pulled ScrEv_press_stop_button
the 
yellow 
cord 
that 
runs UnrelEv_bus
along 
the 
side 
of 
the 
bus 
. 
that 
makes RelNScrEv_bus
a 
beep 
and 
signals RelNScrEv_bus
the 
driver 
that 
someone 
wants UnrelEv_bus
to 
get+off RelNScrEv_bus
the 
bus 
. 
the 
beep 
sounded ScrEv_other_bus

the

driver 
pulled+over ScrEv_bus_stops
to 
the 
side 
of 
the 
road 
at 
the 
next

the 
doors 
opened ScrEv_door_opens

i 
got+up ScrEv_other_bus

<end_of_story>_bus 
to 
get+to UnrelEv_bus
work 
everyday 
i 
take+the+bus Evoking_bus

i 
always 
get+to ScrEv_get_bus_stop
the 
bus 
stop 
early 
to 
wait+for ScrEv_wait
it 
to 
arrive RelNScrEv_bus

once 
it 
comes ScrEv_bus_comes
i 
board ScrEv_board_bus

my 
metro 
card 
to 
pay ScrEv_get_ticket
. 
if 
i 
do 
n't 
have UnrelEv_bus
my 
card 
i 
have 
to 
feed RelNScrEv_bus
money 
into 
the 
machine 
which 
always 
stressed UnrelEv_bus
me 
out 
for 
some 
reason 
. 
then 
i 
choose ScrEv_find_place
a 
seat 
if 
one 
is 
available 
. 
if 
not 
i 
stand ScrEv_spend_time_bus
. 
if 
i 
see UnrelEv_bus
someone 
who 
is 
elderly 
or 
pregnant 
i 
always 
give ScrEv_other_bus
them 
my 
seat 
. 
sometimes 
crazy 
people 
are UnrelEv_bus
on 
the 
bus 
as 
well 
. 
there 
is UnrelEv_bus
nothing 
to 
be 
done 
but 
avoid UnrelEv_bus
them 
and 
hope UnrelEv_bus
they 
do 
n't 
bother UnrelEv_bus
you 
. 
the 
bus 
stops ScrEv_bus_stops
and 
starts ScrEv_other_bus
a

passenger 
board ScrEv_board_bus
and 
depart ScrEv_get_off

when 
i 
get+to ScrEv_other_bus
my 
stop 
i 
pull ScrEv_press_stop_button
the 
cord 
at 
the 
top 
of 
the 
bus 
so 
the 
driver 
knows UnrelEv_bus
to 
stop RelNScrEv_bus

once 
we 
stop ScrEv_bus_stops
i

<end_of_story>_bus 
i 
usually 
do 
n't 
take+the+bus Evoking_bus
to 
work 
but 
today 
i 
decided UnrelEv_bus
to 
give UnrelEv_bus
it 
a 
try 
since 
the 
bus 
stop 
is UnrelEv_bus
right 
across 
the 
street 
from 
my 
house 
. 
when 
the 
bus 
came ScrEv_bus_comes
i 
greeted RelNScrEv_bus
the 
bus 
driver 
with 
a 
friendly 
hello 
and 
paid ScrEv_get_ticket
my 
bus 
fare 
. 
i 
was UnrelEv_bus
lucky 
enough 
to 
find ScrEv_find_place
a 
seat 
all 
the 
way 
in 
the 
back 
. 
there 
was RelNScrEv_bus
a 
lot 
of 
different 
people 
on 
the 
bus 
, 
some 
were UnrelEv_bus
kids 
going UnrelEv_bus
to

others 
were UnrelEv_bus
adults 
going UnrelEv_bus
to 
work 
like 
i 
was 
. 
i 
watched UnrelEv_bus
the 
bus 
come ScrEv_bus_stops
to 
a 
stop 
every 
few 
blocks 
and 
drop+off ScrEv_get_off
a 
few 
people 
, 
but 
for 
every 
person 
that 
left RelNScrEv_bus
a 
new 
person 
got+on ScrEv_board_bus
. 
i 
noticed UnrelEv_bus
my 
stop 
was UnrelEv_bus
near 
so 
i 
pushed ScrEv_press_stop_button
the 
strip 
on 
the 
wall 
that 
notifies RelNScrEv_bus
the 
bus 
driver 
my 
stop 
is 
coming+up RelNScrEv_bus
. 
when 
he 
pulled ScrEv_ride
into 
the 
next 
stop 
i 
exited ScrEv_get_off
the 
back 
of 
the 
bus 
and 
was UnrelEv_bus
happy 
that 
after 
523 
minutes 
i 
finally 
reached UnrelEv_bus
my 
destination 
. 
<end_of_story>_bus 
after 
touring UnrelEv_bus
the 
city 
, 
i 
arrived ScrEv_get_bus_stop
at 
the 
public 
bus 
stop 
and 
took RelNScrEv_bus
a 
seat 
on 
the 
bench 
waiting ScrEv_wait
for 
the 
bus 
to 
arrive ScrEv_bus_comes
. 
i 
looked+at ScrEv_check_time-table
a 
map 
on 
what 
this 
bus 
's 
route 
was UnrelEv_bus
, 
and 
it 
was 
heading ScrEv_ride
towards 
where 
i 
needed 
to 
go RelNScrEv_bus
. 
since 
i 
am 
easily 
bored UnrelEv_bus
, 
i 
brought UnrelEv_bus
my 
mp3 
player 
with 
me 
to 
listen+to RelNScrEv_bus
music 
. 
after 
a 
523 
minute 
wait 
the 
bus 
arrived ScrEv_bus_comes
and 
i 
got+on ScrEv_board_bus
with 
another 
person 
. 
as 
i 
walked+up ScrEv_board_bus
on 
the 
bus 
, 
i 
paid ScrEv_get_ticket
the 
fee 
that 
is 
required RelNScrEv_bus
since 
i 
do 
n't 
have RelNScrEv_bus
a 
bus 
pass 
. 
since 
most 
people 
in 
the 
city 
like UnrelEv_bus
to 
keep+to UnrelEv_bus
themselves 
, 
i 
left UnrelEv_bus
them 
alone 
and 
found ScrEv_find_place
an 
open 
seat 
on 
the 
bus 
in 
the 
back 
. 
after 
about 
523 
minutes 
on 
the 
bus 
, 
they 
finally 
arrived+at ScrEv_bus_stops
my 
destination 
spot 
and 
i 
got+off ScrEv_get_off
. 
after 
getting+off ScrEv_get_off
the 
bus 
, 
i 
walked UnrelEv_bus
a 
couple 
more 
blocks 
over 
to 
where 
my 
hotel 
was UnrelEv_bus
. 
<end_of_story>_bus 
i 
live UnrelEv_bus
in 
an 
area 
with 
good 
train 
and 
bus 
coverage 
. 
i 
typically 
choose UnrelEv_bus
the 
train 
as 
it 
is UnrelEv_bus
more 
predictable 
but 
for 
some 
parts 
of 
the 
city 
that 
the 
train 
can 
not 
reach UnrelEv_bus
, 
i 
will 
take+the+bus Evoking_bus
. 
the 
bus 
stations 
are UnrelEv_bus
typically 
outdoors 
so 
depending UnrelEv_bus
on 
where 
i 
'm 
going UnrelEv_bus
i 
'll 
head ScrEv_get_bus_stop
to 
the 
nearest 
bus 
stop 
. 
there 
's UnrelEv_bus
an 
app 
that 
shoes ScrEv_check_time-table
when 
the 
next 
bus 
is 
coming ScrEv_bus_comes
so 
i 
'll 
take+out RelNScrEv_bus
my 
phone 
to 
see ScrEv_check_time-table
how 
long 
the 
wait 
is ScrEv_wait
. 
typically 
the 
wait 
is ScrEv_wait
about 
10-15 
minutes 
. 
once 
the 
bus 
arrives ScrEv_bus_comes
, 
i 
take+out RelNScrEv_bus
my 
transit 
card 
to 
tap ScrEv_get_ticket
on 
the 
machine 
that 
collects ScrEv_get_ticket
the 
fare 
. 
this 
is 
done UnrelEv_bus
at 
the 
very 
beginning 
at 
the 
entrance 
of 
the 
bus 
. 
once 
i 
hear RelNScrEv_bus
the 
beep 
notifying RelNScrEv_bus
me 
that 
the 
fare 
has 
been 
collected ScrEv_get_ticket
i 
will 
take ScrEv_find_place
a 
seat 
upstairs 
if 
it 
's UnrelEv_bus
a 
double 
decker 
bus 
. 
the 
view 
is UnrelEv_bus
much 
better 
from 
the 
top 
and 
there 
are UnrelEv_bus
usually 
seats 
at 
the 
top 
. 
now 
it 
's UnrelEv_bus
time 
to 
sit+back ScrEv_spend_time_bus
and 
enjoy ScrEv_spend_time_bus
the 
ride 
and 
get+off ScrEv_get_off
at 
my 
destination 
. 
<end_of_story>_bus 
i 
woke+up UnrelEv_bus
early 
in 
the 
morning 
and 
walked ScrEv_get_bus_stop
from 
my 
house 
to 
the 
road 
where 
the 
bus 
travels ScrEv_ride
. 
this 
is UnrelEv_bus
a 
busy 
bus 
route 
, 
so 
there 
are UnrelEv_bus
a 
lot 
of 
buses 
i 
can 
catch ScrEv_find_bus
at 
this 
spot 
. 
i 
waited ScrEv_wait
523 
minutes 
and 
saw UnrelEv_bus
a 
bus 
in 
the 
distance 
coming ScrEv_bus_comes
my 
way 
. 
i 
waited ScrEv_wait
patiently 
at 
the 
bus 
stop 
making+sure UnrelEv_bus
the 
bus 
driver 
could 
see UnrelEv_bus
i 
wanted 
to 
board ScrEv_board_bus
. 
the 
bus 
driver 
stopped ScrEv_bus_comes
the 
bus 
and 
opened ScrEv_door_opens
the 
door 
for 
me 
. 
i 
had 
to 
wait RelNScrEv_bus
for 
some 
other 
passengers 
to 
get+off ScrEv_get_off
the 
bus 
first 
. 
i 
walked+up ScrEv_board_bus
steps 
into 
the 
bus 
and 
paid ScrEv_get_ticket
for 
my 
trip 
. 
there 
is UnrelEv_bus
a 
machine 
that 
collects RelNScrEv_bus
money 
and 
tokens 
in 
front 
of 
the 
bus 
. 
luckily 
, 
there 
was ScrEv_find_place
a 
seat 
available 
to 
sit+in ScrEv_find_place
. 
i 
rode ScrEv_ride
the 
bus 
for 
about 
523 
minutes 
until 
we 
were 
coming+close ScrEv_bus_stops
to 
my 
stop 
. 
i 
pulled ScrEv_press_stop_button
the 
string 
to 
tell ScrEv_press_stop_button
the 
bus 
driver 
i 
wanted+off ScrEv_get_off
. 
i 
said RelNScrEv_bus
goodbye 
and 
got+off ScrEv_get_off
the 
bus 
and 
went UnrelEv_bus
to 
my 
destination 
. 
<end_of_story>_bus 
riding+a+public+bus Evoking_bus
is UnrelEv_bus
n't 
something 
i 
look+forward UnrelEv_bus
to 
doing UnrelEv_bus
. 
when 
i 
was UnrelEv_bus
a 
teenager 
some 
friends 
convinced UnrelEv_bus
me 
that 
it 
would 
be UnrelEv_bus
fun 
to 
jump+on ScrEv_board_bus
a 
bus 
and 
ride+around ScrEv_ride
. 
having 
done UnrelEv_bus
so 
, 
i 
disagree UnrelEv_bus
, 
it 
is UnrelEv_bus
n't 
fun 
. 
however 
, 
for 
some 
people 
the 
bus 
is UnrelEv_bus
the 
only 
mode 
of 
transportation 
available 
. 
riding+the+bus Evoking_bus
does 
require UnrelEv_bus
a 
little 
research 
. 
you 
have 
to 
know UnrelEv_bus
which 
line 
you 
are 
riding ScrEv_ride
, 
whether 
it 
is UnrelEv_bus
an 
express 
or 
whether 
it 
will 
be 
making ScrEv_bus_stops
many 
stops 
. 
you 
must 
also 
have RelNScrEv_bus
the 
appropriate 
amount 
of 
fare 
ready 
to 
pay ScrEv_get_ticket
. 
once 
on 
board 
the 
bus 
, 
it 
's UnrelEv_bus
best 
to 
find ScrEv_find_place
a 
hopefully 
clean 
seat 
nearby 
a 
normal 
looking UnrelEv_bus
person 
. 
since 
bus 
fare 
is UnrelEv_bus
quite 
cheap 
and 
anyone 
can 
use Evoking_bus
it 
, 
they 
do 
tend UnrelEv_bus
to 
attract UnrelEv_bus
undesirable 
types 
, 
so 
it 
's UnrelEv_bus
best 
to 
be+aware UnrelEv_bus
of 
that 
fact 
and 
watch ScrEv_spend_time_bus
yourself 
and 
your 
belongings 
closely 
. 
listen ScrEv_spend_time_bus
and 
watch ScrEv_spend_time_bus
to 
make+sure UnrelEv_bus
you 
do 
n't 
miss RelNScrEv_bus
your 
stop 
, 
since 
busses 
do 
get UnrelEv_bus
crowded RelNScrEv_bus
and 
you 
do 
n't 
want UnrelEv_bus
to 
miss RelNScrEv_bus
it 
. 
<end_of_story>_bus 
i 
waited ScrEv_wait
at 
the 
bus 
stop 
for 
my 
bus 
to 
come ScrEv_bus_comes
pick ScrEv_board_bus
me 
up 
. 
it 
seemed UnrelEv_bus
to 
be 
running RelNScrEv_bus
a 
little 
behind 
today 
. 
finally 
, 
at 
8:03 
, 
the 
bus 
pulled+up ScrEv_bus_comes
. 
there 
were UnrelEv_bus
other 
people 
at 
the 
stop 
as 
well 
, 
so 
i 
waited RelNScrEv_bus
in 
lined 
for 
my 
turn 
to 
get+on ScrEv_board_bus
. 
i 
climbed ScrEv_board_bus
the 
three 
steps 
up 
into 
the 
bus 
, 
and 
then 
deposited ScrEv_get_ticket
my 
change 
to 
pay ScrEv_get_ticket
for 
the 
trip 
. 
the 
fare 
was UnrelEv_bus
$ 
523 
so 
i 
put ScrEv_get_ticket
six 
quarters 
into 
the 
box 
. 
then 
i 
walked RelNScrEv_bus
down 
the 
aisle 
of 
the 
bus 
and 
looked+for ScrEv_find_place
an 
empty 
seat 
. 
i 
found ScrEv_find_place
one 
next 
to 
a 
young 
person 
listening+to ScrEv_spend_time_bus
music 
on 
their 
headphones 
. 
the 
bus 
pulled+away ScrEv_bus_leaves
from 
the 
curb 
. 
as 
we 
rode ScrEv_ride
, 
i 
looked+out ScrEv_spend_time_bus
the 
window 
and 
watched ScrEv_spend_time_bus
the 
stores 
and 
houses 
pass+by RelNScrEv_bus
. 
after 
about 
523 
minutes 
, 
we 
reached ScrEv_bus_stops
my 
stop 
. 
i 
waited RelNScrEv_bus
for 
the 
bus 
to 
come ScrEv_bus_stops
to 
a 
complete 
stop 
and 
then 
exited ScrEv_get_off
, 
steeping+down ScrEv_get_off
and 
then 
stepping ScrEv_get_off
back 
up 
the 
curb 
onto 
the 
sidewalk 
. 
time 
to 
start UnrelEv_bus
another 
day 
! 
<end_of_story>_bus 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_bus
to 
spend UnrelEv_bus
the 
evening 
at 
the 
theater 
on 
friday 
. 
there 
was UnrelEv_bus
a 
good 
play 
on 
in 
town 
and 
i 
decided UnrelEv_bus
to 
take+the+bus Evoking_bus
. 
at 
6:30 
pm 
, 
i 
walked ScrEv_get_bus_stop
to 
the 
bus 
stop 
near 
my 
house 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_bus
a 
ten-minute 
walk 
in 
nice 
weather 
. 
at 
the 
bus 
stop 
, 
i 
waited ScrEv_wait
only 
two 
minutes 
before 
the 
bus 
arrived ScrEv_bus_comes
. 
i 
stepped+onto ScrEv_board_bus
the 
public 
bus 
and 
paid ScrEv_get_ticket
for 
a 
one-way 
ticket 
. 
the 
trip 
into 
town 
took RelNScrEv_bus
fifteen 
minutes 
because 
the 
bus 
had 
other 
stops 
to 
make ScrEv_bus_stops
in 
the 
area 
before 
returning ScrEv_bus_stops
to 
the 
station 
. 
i 
saw ScrEv_spend_time_bus
someone 
i 
knew UnrelEv_bus
on 
the 
bus 
and 
we 
spent ScrEv_spend_time_bus
most 
of 
the 
travel 
time 
talking ScrEv_spend_time_bus
. 
then 
we 
reached ScrEv_bus_stops
the 
bus 
station 
. 
the 
driver 
slowed+down ScrEv_bus_stops
, 
and 
maneuvered RelNScrEv_bus
the 
bus 
into 
its 
numbered UnrelEv_bus
space 
. 
the 
doors 
opened ScrEv_door_opens
and 
the 
passengers 
began UnrelEv_bus
to 
exit ScrEv_get_off
, 
moving RelNScrEv_bus
together 
smoothly 
at 
a 
leisurely 
pace 
. 
i 
got+off ScrEv_get_off
the 
bus 
and 
went UnrelEv_bus
to 
the 
theater 
. 
<end_of_story>_bus 
late 
last 
week 
on 
my 
way 
home 
from 
work 
i 
got UnrelEv_bus
into 
an 
accident 
that 
damaged UnrelEv_bus
my 
car 
. 
luckily 
everyone 
who 
was 
involved+came+out+uninjured UnrelEv_bus
but 
my 
car 
was 
damaged UnrelEv_bus
and 
would 
have 
to 
spend UnrelEv_bus
about 
two 
weeks 
in 
the 
shop 
. 
since 
my 
insurance 
did 
not 
cover UnrelEv_bus
a 
rent UnrelEv_bus
a 
car 
this 
meant UnrelEv_bus
that 
i 
had 
to 
take+public+transportation Evoking_bus
for 
the 
next 
couple 
of 
weeks 
to 
get UnrelEv_bus
to 
work 
. 
i 
was UnrelEv_bus
fortunate 
to 
have UnrelEv_bus
a 
bus 
stop 
only 
a 
couple 
of 
blocks 
from 
my 
house 
so 
i 
would 
walk ScrEv_get_bus_stop
to 
the 
bus 
stop 
and 
wait ScrEv_wait
for 
the 
bus 
with 
the 
other 
people 
. 
some 
people 
talked RelNScrEv_bus
to 
one 
another 
and 
others 
like 
myself 
had RelNScrEv_bus
headphones 
in 
, 
listening+to RelNScrEv_bus
music 
. 
it 
is UnrelEv_bus
not 
that 
i 
am UnrelEv_bus
against 
talking RelNScrEv_bus
to 
people 
i 
am UnrelEv_bus
just 
not 
really 
a 
morning 
person 
and 
do 
not 
feel UnrelEv_bus
like 
it 
at 
7am 
. 
the 
bus 
pulled+up ScrEv_bus_comes
and 
we 
got RelNScrEv_bus
in 
line 
to 
board ScrEv_board_bus
and 
showed ScrEv_get_ticket
him 
our 
ticket 
to 
ride ScrEv_ride
. 
i 
then 
grabbed ScrEv_find_place
a 
seat 
and 
gazed+out ScrEv_spend_time_bus
the 
window 
until 
i 
reached ScrEv_bus_stops
my 
stop 
downtown 
. 
i 
got+up ScrEv_go_exit
, 
thanked RelNScrEv_bus
the 
bus 
driver 
and 
got+off ScrEv_get_off
the 
bus 
and 
started+walking UnrelEv_bus
down 
the 
street 
to 
work 
. 
<end_of_story>_bus 
i 
went UnrelEv_bus
to 
college 
in 
a 
big 
city 
and 
did 
n't 
have UnrelEv_bus
a 
car 
on 
campus 
. 
thankfully 
, 
there 
was UnrelEv_bus
n't 
a 
need 
for 
one 
because 
the 
public 
transportation 
system 
was UnrelEv_bus
great 
. 
i 
often 
went UnrelEv_bus
to 
visit UnrelEv_bus
my 
friend 
that 
went UnrelEv_bus
to 
school 
on 
the 
other 
side 
of 
town 
. 
i 
always 
took+a+public+bus Evoking_bus
to 
get RelNScrEv_bus
there 
. 
the 
first 
thing 
i 
would 
do UnrelEv_bus
is 
look+up ScrEv_check_time-table
the 
bus 
route 
and 
schedule 
. 
once 
i 
knew UnrelEv_bus
what 
time 
the 
bus 
would 
arrive ScrEv_bus_comes
, 
i 
'd 
walk ScrEv_get_bus_stop
to 
the 
bus 
stop 
and 
wait ScrEv_wait
on 
the 
bench 
. 
once 
the 
bus 
arrived ScrEv_bus_comes
, 
i 
would 
pay ScrEv_get_ticket
the 
driver 
via 
a 
electronic 
machine 
and 
was Unclear_bus
then 
on 
my 
life 
. 
the 
bus 
would 
make ScrEv_bus_stops
many 
stops 
before 
arriving ScrEv_bus_stops
at 
mine 
. 
at 
one 
point 
, 
the 
bus 
was RelNScrEv_bus
full 
and 
i 
gave+up RelNScrEv_bus
my 
seat 
so 
that 
an 
older 
lady 
could 
sit+down ScrEv_find_place
. 
once 
i 
saw UnrelEv_bus
that 
my 
stop 
was 
arriving ScrEv_bus_stops
, 
i 
pulled ScrEv_press_stop_button
the 
lever 
to 
let UnrelEv_bus
the 
bus 
driver 
know UnrelEv_bus
that 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_bus
to 
depart ScrEv_get_off
the 
bus 
at 
the 
next 
stop 
. 
i 
then 
thanked RelNScrEv_bus
the 
driver 
and 
was ScrEv_get_off
on 
my 
way 
. 
<end_of_story>_bus 
there 
are UnrelEv_bus
times 
when 
i 
need 
to 
get UnrelEv_bus
somewhere 
without 
using UnrelEv_bus
my 
car 
or 
without 
using UnrelEv_bus
the 
tube 
. 
for 
these 
times 
i 
use+transport+for+london+'s+public+bus+system Evoking_bus
. 
one 
such 
time 
just 
happened UnrelEv_bus
yesterday 
. 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_bus
to 
go UnrelEv_bus
from 
my 
flat 
to 
the 
bumping 
club 
in 
shoreditch 
. 
unfortunately 
it 
was UnrelEv_bus
past 
midnight 
and 
the 
tubes 
were 
closed UnrelEv_bus
. 
i 
decided UnrelEv_bus
upon 
taking+a+bus Evoking_bus
instead 
of 
taking UnrelEv_bus
a 
minicab 
or 
a 
taxi 
. 
i 
found ScrEv_get_bus_stop
the 
bus 
stop 
and 
waited ScrEv_wait
patiently 
for 
the 
correct 
bus 
. 
stepping+on ScrEv_board_bus
i 
tapped+in ScrEv_get_ticket
and 
greeted RelNScrEv_bus
the 
driver 
. 
he 
seemed UnrelEv_bus
very 
nice 
, 
as 
did UnrelEv_bus
the 
people 
on 
the 
bus 
. 
it 
was 
filled RelNScrEv_bus
with 
many 
other 
revelers 
who 
were UnrelEv_bus
in 
similar 
states 
of 
intoxication 
. 
we 
rode ScrEv_ride
towards 
our 
destination 
, 
a 
popular 
club 
, 
in 
unison 
. 
i 
met ScrEv_spend_time_bus
a 
pretty 
girl 
who 
i 
talked ScrEv_spend_time_bus
with 
at 
length 
. 
we 
decided UnrelEv_bus
we 
were 
going 
to 
dance UnrelEv_bus
together 
at 
the 
club 
! 
all 
in 
all 
it 
was UnrelEv_bus
an 
exciting 
and 
enjoyable 
ride 
on 
a 
london 
double 
decker 
bus 
! 
<end_of_story>_bus 
i 
really 
like UnrelEv_bus
to 
take+the+bus Evoking_bus
when 
i 
have 
to 
run UnrelEv_bus
errands 
. 
there 
is UnrelEv_bus
a 
bus 
stop 
right 
outside 
of 
my 
apartment 
building 
. 
when 
i 
have 
to 
go UnrelEv_bus
to 
the 
store 
, 
i 
wait ScrEv_wait
at 
the 
bus 
stop 
. 
when 
the 
bus 
pulls+up ScrEv_bus_comes
, 
i 
pay ScrEv_get_ticket
the 
bus 
fare 
using UnrelEv_bus
quarters 
. 
it 
costs ScrEv_get_ticket
six 
quarters 
to 
ride+the+bus Evoking_bus
. 
the 
bus 
makes ScrEv_bus_stops
lots 
of 
different 
stops 
before 
it 
gets ScrEv_bus_stops
to 
the 
grocery 
store 
, 
so 
i 
am+on ScrEv_ride
it 
for 
several 
minutes 
. 
i 
sit ScrEv_find_place
quietly 
in 
my 
seat 
. 
sometimes 
other 
people 
on 
the 
bus 
will 
say ScrEv_spend_time_bus
hello 
and 
we 
will 
have ScrEv_spend_time_bus
a 
small 
conversation 
. 
when 
i 
get ScrEv_bus_stops
to 
the 
store 
and 
finish+shopping UnrelEv_bus
, 
i 
wait ScrEv_wait
at 
another 
bus 
stop 
so 
i 
can 
go Evoking_bus
home 
. 
i 
pay ScrEv_get_ticket
the 
bus 
fare 
again 
, 
sit ScrEv_find_place
in 
my 
seat 
and 
patiently 
wait+for ScrEv_ride
the 
bus 
to 
get+to ScrEv_bus_stops
my 
apartment 
. 
when 
it 
stops ScrEv_bus_stops
in 
front 
of 
my 
apartment 
, 
i 
get+off ScrEv_get_off
the 
bus 
and 
go UnrelEv_bus
inside 
. 
<end_of_story>_bus 
i 
needed 
to 
get UnrelEv_bus
from 
my 
house 
to 
work 
, 
but 
my 
car 
wouldn 
' 
t 
start UnrelEv_bus
. 
i 
decided UnrelEv_bus
my 
best 
option 
was UnrelEv_bus
to 
take+the+bus Evoking_bus
. 
i 
walked+down ScrEv_get_bus_stop
the 
street 
to 
the 
nearest 
bus 
stop 
that 
would 
take Unclear_bus
me 
close 
to 
work 
. 
i 
waited ScrEv_wait
for 
about 
five 
minutes 
for 
the 
bus 
to 
come ScrEv_bus_comes
. 
once 
i 
got+on ScrEv_board_bus
, 
i 
put ScrEv_get_ticket
my 
money 
in 
the 
machine 
and 
headed RelNScrEv_bus
towards 
the 
back 
to 
find ScrEv_find_place
a 
seat 
. 
there 
were UnrelEv_bus
only 
three 
open 
seats 
so 
i 
took ScrEv_find_place
one 
of 
them 
and 
popped+in RelNScrEv_bus
my 
ear 
buds 
to 
listen+to ScrEv_spend_time_bus
music 
. 
i 
also 
brought RelNScrEv_bus
a 
book 
along 
to 
read ScrEv_spend_time_bus
so 
nobody 
would 
try UnrelEv_bus
to 
talk+to ScrEv_spend_time_bus
me 
. 
the 
bus 
made ScrEv_bus_stops
three 
stops 
before 
we 
got+to ScrEv_bus_stops
the 
corner 
nearest 
to 
my 
work 
. 
each 
time 
people 
would 
get+off ScrEv_get_off
and 
as 
they 
shuffled+past ScrEv_go_exit
would 
bump RelNScrEv_bus
into 
my 
knees 
which 
was 
really 
annoying UnrelEv_bus
. 
then 
more 
people 
would 
get+on ScrEv_board_bus
and 
some 
would 
find ScrEv_find_place
seats 
, 
but 
others 
had 
to 
stand ScrEv_find_place
. 
one 
person 
stood ScrEv_find_place
directly 
in 
front 
of 
me 
, 
in 
constant 
contact 
with 
my 
legs 
. 
this 
really 
annoyed UnrelEv_bus
me 
even 
more 
. 
i 
don 
' 
t 
like UnrelEv_bus
riding+public+transportation Evoking_bus
. 
finally 
we 
got+to ScrEv_bus_stops
my 
stop 
and 
i 
got+out ScrEv_get_off
of 
the 
bus 
through 
the 
rear 
doors 
. 
<end_of_story>_bus 
my 
car 
had 
recently 
broke+down UnrelEv_bus
and 
i 
had UnrelEv_bus
no 
mode 
of 
transportation 
, 
i 
needed 
to 
ride+the+bus Evoking_bus
to 
work 
everyday 
now 
. 
i 
had 
never 
rode+the+bus Evoking_bus
before 
so 
it 
was UnrelEv_bus
kind 
of 
a 
daunting 
experience 
. 
i 
looked+up UnrelEv_bus
what 
i 
needed 
to 
do UnrelEv_bus
online 
, 
the 
first 
thing 
i 
needed 
to 
do UnrelEv_bus
was 
buy ScrEv_get_ticket
a 
bus 
pass 
in 
order 
to 
even 
ride+the+bus Evoking_bus
. 
after 
that 
it 
was UnrelEv_bus
relatively 
simple 
, 
i 
just 
had 
to 
wait+for UnrelEv_bus
the 
bus 
that 
would 
take ScrEv_ride
me 
nearest 
to 
my 
office 
building 
, 
and 
board ScrEv_board_bus
it 
. 
once 
i 
was+on ScrEv_board_bus
i 
just 
had 
to 
scan ScrEv_get_ticket
my 
pass 
and 
pick ScrEv_find_place
a 
seat 
. 
after 
that 
i 
just 
waited ScrEv_ride
until 
i 
reached ScrEv_bus_stops
my 
stop 
and 
i 
got+off ScrEv_get_off
of 
the 
bus 
. 
once 
work 
was UnrelEv_bus
over 
i 
just 
did Unclear_bus
the 
same 
thing 
and 
got+off ScrEv_get_off
at 
the 
stop 
as 
close 
to 
my 
house 
as 
possible 
. 
riding+the+bus Evoking_bus
was UnrelEv_bus
not 
as 
scary 
as 
i 
thought UnrelEv_bus
it 
would 
be UnrelEv_bus
. 
<end_of_story>_bus 
i 
walk ScrEv_get_bus_stop
a 
few 
blocks 
from 
my 
home 
to 
the 
local 
bus 
stop 
picking+up UnrelEv_bus
a 
newspaper 
along 
the 
way 
. 
as 
the 
bus 
arrives ScrEv_bus_comes
i 
prepare UnrelEv_bus
to 
remove RelNScrEv_bus
money 
from 
my 
wallet 
for 
the 
fare 
. 
as 
the 
bus 
stops ScrEv_bus_comes
the 
doors 
open ScrEv_door_opens
and 
i 
walk+up ScrEv_board_bus
the 
metal 
steps 
and 
stop UnrelEv_bus
to 
pay ScrEv_get_ticket
my 
fare 
to 
the 
driver 
. 
the 
bus 
is UnrelEv_bus
partially 
full 
but 
with 
enough 
seats 
to 
choose ScrEv_find_place
from 
i 
select ScrEv_find_place
a 
window 
seat 
. 
being UnrelEv_bus
a 
warm 
day 
i 
open ScrEv_spend_time_bus
the 
window 
a 
crack 
to 
get UnrelEv_bus
a 
breeze 
on 
me 
. 
during 
my 
ride 
just 
out 
of 
curiosity 
i 
check+out ScrEv_spend_time_bus
all 
of 
the 
other 
passengers 
before 
settling+down UnrelEv_bus
to 
read ScrEv_spend_time_bus
my 
newspaper 
. 
i 
check+out ScrEv_spend_time_bus
the 
local 
scores 
in 
the 
sports 
section 
first 
then 
continue UnrelEv_bus
to 
read ScrEv_spend_time_bus
the 
remainder 
of 
the 
paper 
. 
as 
the 
bus 
nears ScrEv_bus_stops
my 
stop 
i 
get+up ScrEv_go_exit
and 
walk ScrEv_go_exit
to 
the 
exit 
waiting RelNScrEv_bus
for 
the 
door 
to 
open ScrEv_door_opens
then 
depart ScrEv_get_off
. 
<end_of_story>_bus 
my 
boss 
gave UnrelEv_bus
me 
tickets 
to 
the 
pittsburgh 
penguins 
hockey 
game 
. 
the 
penguins 
play UnrelEv_bus
in 
the 
downtown 
area 
of 
my 
city 
. 
i 
live UnrelEv_bus
in 
a 
busy 
city 
so 
driving UnrelEv_bus
a 
car 
to 
the 
downtown 
area 
is UnrelEv_bus
n't 
always 
the 
best 
idea 
. 
first 
, 
you 
have 
to 
deal UnrelEv_bus
with 
traffic 
. 
after 
dealing UnrelEv_bus
with 
traffic 
, 
you 
have 
to 
find UnrelEv_bus
a 
place 
to 
park UnrelEv_bus
. 
paying UnrelEv_bus
for 
parking UnrelEv_bus
is 
very 
expensive 
. 
a 
public 
bus 
is UnrelEv_bus
usually 
the 
quickest 
way 
to 
get+to UnrelEv_bus
downtown 
. 
first 
, 
i 
had 
to 
go+to ScrEv_get_bus_stop
the 
bus 
stop 
and 
get ScrEv_check_time-table
a 
schedule 
to 
plan ScrEv_check_time-table
my 
bus 
trip 
. 
i 
did UnrelEv_bus
this 
days 
in 
advance 
, 
because 
i 
was 
really 
excited UnrelEv_bus
for 
the 
game 
. 
after 
setting RelNScrEv_bus
the 
time 
i 
would 
get+on ScrEv_board_bus
the 
bus 
, 
i 
made+sure UnrelEv_bus
to 
arrive ScrEv_get_bus_stop
523 
minutes 
early 
so 
i 
do 
n't 
miss RelNScrEv_bus
the 
bus 
. 
i 
got+on ScrEv_board_bus
the 
bus 
and 
paid ScrEv_get_ticket
my 
fare 
for 
the 
trip 
. 
i 
sat+back ScrEv_find_place
and 
let UnrelEv_bus
the 
bus 
driver 
take ScrEv_ride
me 
right 
to 
the 
front 
entrance 
of 
the 
hockey 
arena 
because 
that 
's UnrelEv_bus
where 
the 
bus 
stop 
was UnrelEv_bus
. 
<end_of_story>_bus 
in 
the 
morning 
, 
i 
had 
to 
get+ready UnrelEv_bus
to 
go UnrelEv_bus
to 
work 
. 
at 
the 
time 
, 
i 
did 
n't 
have UnrelEv_bus
a 
car 
, 
and 
the 
weather 
was UnrelEv_bus
too 
wet 
and 
windy 
to 
use UnrelEv_bus
a 
bicycle 
for 
transportation 
. 
after 
a 
quick 
breakfast 
, 
i 
got UnrelEv_bus
my 
good 
shoes 
on 
and 
a 
jacket 
. 
out 
the 
door 
, 
i 
locked UnrelEv_bus
the 
deadbolt 
and 
went+for ScrEv_get_bus_stop
the 
bus 
stop 
about 
523 
blocks 
away 
from 
my 
house 
. 
i 
called ScrEv_check_time-table
the 
bus 
lines 
number 
and 
input ScrEv_check_time-table
the 
code 
on 
my 
phone 
corresponding UnrelEv_bus
to 
the 
bus 
arrival 
at 
my 
stop 
, 
and 
realized UnrelEv_bus
i 
only 
had ScrEv_wait
a 
523 
minute 
wait 
. 
the 
bus 
arrived ScrEv_bus_comes
, 
and 
i 
paid ScrEv_get_ticket
the 
fare 
for 
my 
2-hour 
ticket 
. 
i 
went+to RelNScrEv_bus
the 
back 
of 
the 
bus 
, 
as 
there 
were UnrelEv_bus
no 
seats 
in 
the 
front 
. 
the 
bus 
came UnrelEv_bus
to 
life 
as 
it 
passed RelNScrEv_bus
other 
stops 
without 
passengers 
, 
and 
we 
eventually 
got+to ScrEv_bus_stops
the 
transit 
station 
, 
where 
i 
was 
able+to+walk UnrelEv_bus
by 
foot 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
way 
to 
my 
workplace 
. 
<end_of_story>_bus 
a 
few 
years 
ago 
we 
took UnrelEv_bus
a 
mexican 
vacation 
. 
we 
heard UnrelEv_bus
the 
best 
way 
to 
travel+is UnrelEv_bus
on 
the 
bus 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_bus
very 
hot 
and 
tropical 
. 
we 
stood ScrEv_wait
outside 
in 
the 
heat 
on 
the 
long 
sidewalk 
waiting+for ScrEv_wait
it 
. 
as 
we 
were 
standing ScrEv_wait
there 
a 
giant 
gecko 
came+out UnrelEv_bus
of 
the 
bushes 
. 
they 
say UnrelEv_bus
not 
to 
get+near UnrelEv_bus
them 
. 
we 
hopped+on ScrEv_board_bus
the 
bus 
. 
the 
bus 
was UnrelEv_bus
very 
inexpensive 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_bus
a 
mixture 
of 
locals 
and 
tourists 
. 
we 
decided UnrelEv_bus
to 
ride+the+bus Evoking_bus
to 
the 
old 
side 
of 
town 
. 
we 
got+off ScrEv_get_off
near 
a 
strange 
mcdonalds 
. 
very 
soon 
after 
that 
we 
got+back+on ScrEv_board_bus
the 
bus 
and 
went+back ScrEv_ride
into 
the 
main 
part 
of 
town 
where 
we 
felt UnrelEv_bus
safe 
. 
after 
that 
we 
just 
got+on ScrEv_ride
and 
off 
within 
a 
few 
mile 
radius 
of 
the 
hotel 
. 
we 
did 
end+up+renting UnrelEv_bus
a 
car 
the 
next 
day 
. 
<end_of_story>_bus 
i 
found UnrelEv_bus
myself 
in 
my 
youth 
in 
a 
precarious 
and 
annoying 
position 
. 
not 
only 
did 
i 
live UnrelEv_bus
in 
the 
very 
rough 
part 
of 
town 
with 
theives 
, 
drug 
dealers 
, 
and 
crack 
addicts 
, 
but 
i 
was UnrelEv_bus
without 
reliable 
transportation 
. 
i 
did 
, 
however 
, 
have UnrelEv_bus
enough 
money 
for 
bus 
fare 
. 
as 
the 
job 
search 
continued UnrelEv_bus
i 
found UnrelEv_bus
an 
oportunity 
on 
the 
other 
side 
of 
town 
working UnrelEv_bus
for 
subway 
. 
i 
utilized+the+bus+service Evoking_bus
. 
the 
characters 
on 
the 
bus 
were UnrelEv_bus
generally 
normal 
people 
but 
there 
were UnrelEv_bus
always 
a 
few 
outliers 
that 
were UnrelEv_bus
a 
bit 
intimidating UnrelEv_bus
. 
most 
of 
these 
reeked+of UnrelEv_bus
alcohol 
and 
insanity 
. 
they 
were UnrelEv_bus
probably 
homeless 
people 
. 
i 
usually 
did 
n't 
talk+to ScrEv_spend_time_bus
too 
many 
people 
on 
the 
bus 
, 
just 
kept+to ScrEv_spend_time_bus
myself 
. 
i 
would 
go+to ScrEv_bus_stops
the 
transfer 
spot 
in 
downtown 
, 
and 
switch ScrEv_change_bus
to 
the 
bus 
that 
would 
take ScrEv_ride
me 
to 
my 
final 
location 
at 
subway 
. 
<end_of_story>_bus 
i 
was 
waiting ScrEv_wait
at 
the 
bus 
stop 
, 
and 
as 
it 
was UnrelEv_bus
a 
very 
hot 
day 
, 
i 
was UnrelEv_bus
happy 
for 
the 
shady 
bench 
. 
more 
people 
gathered+around ScrEv_wait
the 
stop 
, 
getting+on Unclear_bus
and 
off 
other 
buses 
, 
as 
i 
waited+for ScrEv_wait
my 
bus 
to 
arrive ScrEv_bus_comes
. 
finally 
, 
a 
bus 
with 
my 
number 
on 
it 
, 
arrived ScrEv_bus_comes
. 
it 
felt UnrelEv_bus
a 
little 
like 
a 
rush 
to 
get+on ScrEv_board_bus
, 
by 
finally 
i 
had 
paid ScrEv_get_ticket
my 
fair 
, 
and 
looked+for ScrEv_find_place
a 
place 
to 
sit ScrEv_find_place
. 
not 
finding ScrEv_find_place
a 
seat 
, 
i 
placed RelNScrEv_bus
my 
shopping 
bag 
between 
my 
feet 
and 
stood ScrEv_find_place
for 
a 
few 
stops 
, 
holding ScrEv_find_place
the 
handhold 
hanging UnrelEv_bus
from 
the 
ceiling 
. 
finally 
the 
bus 
cleared+out RelNScrEv_bus
a 
little 
and 
i 
was 
able+to UnrelEv_bus
find ScrEv_find_place
a 
place 
to 
sit ScrEv_find_place
. 
i 
read ScrEv_spend_time_bus
my 
book 
, 
looking ScrEv_spend_time_bus
occasionally 
out 
the 
windows 
, 
and 
listening+for ScrEv_spend_time_bus
information 
on 
the 
next 
stop 
, 
until 
finally 
reaching ScrEv_bus_stops
the 
stop 
for 
home 
. 
even 
though 
i 
stepped ScrEv_get_off
carefully 
off 
the 
bus 
, 
i 
did 
stumble RelNScrEv_bus
slightly 
on 
one 
the 
steps 
. 
i 
promised UnrelEv_bus
myself 
to 
be UnrelEv_bus
more 
careful 
in 
the 
future 
. 
<end_of_story>_bus 
i 
needed 
to 
get+to UnrelEv_bus
work 
, 
but 
my 
car 
was 
not 
working UnrelEv_bus
. 
i 
decided UnrelEv_bus
to 
take+the+public+bus Evoking_bus
. 
i 
walked ScrEv_get_bus_stop
to 
the 
bus 
stop 
and 
sat+down RelNScrEv_bus
on 
the 
bench 
that 
was 
provided UnrelEv_bus
. 
i 
waited ScrEv_wait
until 
the 
bus 
that 
i 
needed RelNScrEv_bus
pulled+up ScrEv_bus_comes
and 
boarded ScrEv_board_bus
the 
bus 
. 
i 
paid ScrEv_get_ticket
the 
bus 
driver 
the

they 
wanted UnrelEv_bus

because 
today 
was UnrelEv_bus
her 
first 
time 
taking+the+public+bus Evoking_bus

hannah

her

the

that

she 
did

it

``

hannah 
asked UnrelEv_bus
. 
her 
mother 
replied UnrelEv_bus
that 
it 
was UnrelEv_bus
and 
it 
was UnrelEv_bus
one 
of 
many 
many 
places 
around 
the 
city 
to 
get UnrelEv_bus
the 
bus 
to 
stop ScrEv_bus_stops

they 
waited ScrEv_wait
for 
a 
long 
while 
and 
finally 
a 
large 
public 
bus 
came+down ScrEv_bus_comes
the 
street 
and 
stopped ScrEv_bus_comes
before 
them 
. 
they 
waited RelNScrEv_bus
while 
a 
few 
passengers 
exited ScrEv_get_off
the 
bus 
because 
her 
mom 
said UnrelEv_bus
it 
was UnrelEv_bus
the 
polite 
thing 
to 
do UnrelEv_bus
and 
then 
they 
climbed ScrEv_board_bus
the 
steps 
where 
her 
mother 
dropped ScrEv_get_ticket
their 
coins 
into 
the

toll

her 
mother 
then 
asked ScrEv_get_ticket
for 
a 
transfer 
and 
they 
walked ScrEv_find_place
quickly 
to 
their 
seats

hannah 
asked UnrelEv_bus
her 
mom 
what 
a 
transfer 
was UnrelEv_bus
and 
she 
explained UnrelEv_bus
that 
because 
they 
were 
going UnrelEv_bus
way 
across 
the 
city 
they 
would 
need 
to 
get+on ScrEv_board_bus
yet 
another 
bus 
and 
the 
transfer 
was UnrelEv_bus
so 
the 
other 
bus 
driver 
could 
see UnrelEv_bus
they 
already 
paid ScrEv_get_ticket
for 
their 
ride 
. 
soon 
the 
bus 
jolted ScrEv_bus_stops
to 
another 
stop 
an 
older 
lady 
stepped+onto ScrEv_board_bus
the 
bus 
and 
flashed ScrEv_get_ticket
a 
card 
at 
the 
bus 
driver

took ScrEv_find_place
a 
seat 
at 
the 
front 
of 
the

that 
was 
saved UnrelEv_bus

hannah 
tugged UnrelEv_bus
at 
her

sleeve 
and 
whispered UnrelEv_bus
the 
lady 
did 
not 
pay ScrEv_get_ticket
. 
her 
mother 
quietly 
told UnrelEv_bus
her 
she 
had RelNScrEv_bus
a 
bus 
pass 
that 
she 
paid ScrEv_get_ticket
for 
a 
whole 
months 
worth 
of 
rides 
for 
a 
bigger 
fee 
than 
just 
one 
ride 
. 
that 
people 
who 
use+the+bus Evoking_bus
daily 
buy ScrEv_get_ticket
them 
to 
save UnrelEv_bus
money 
. 
hannah 
thought UnrelEv_bus
to 
herself 
she 
would 
like UnrelEv_bus
bus 
passes 
for 
her 
and 
mommy 
. 
she 
enjoyed ScrEv_ride
the 
bumpy 
ride 
with 
the 
jolting 
stops 
and 
wide 
turns 
that 
made UnrelEv_bus
her 
have 
to 
hold+on RelNScrEv_bus
tight 
. 
hannah 
also 
noticed UnrelEv_bus
people 
pulling ScrEv_press_stop_button
a 
cord 
and 
she 
figured+out UnrelEv_bus
why 
. 
it 
made UnrelEv_bus
the 
bus 
driver 
stop ScrEv_bus_stops
where 
ever 
they 
would 
like 
to 
get+off ScrEv_get_off

oh 
how 
she 
wanted UnrelEv_bus
to 
pull ScrEv_press_stop_button
the 
string

, 
mommy 
told UnrelEv_bus
her 
no 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_bus
only 
for 
when 
you 
needed UnrelEv_bus
it 
. 
soon 
the 
bus 
stopped ScrEv_bus_stops
at 
the 
busy 
bus 
station

they 
stepped+off ScrEv_get_off
the

got+on ScrEv_board_bus
a

her

handed ScrEv_get_ticket
the

their

going+was UnrelEv_bus
the

the

they 
even 
picked+up ScrEv_board_bus
a 
man 
in 
a 
wheelchair

he 
drove ScrEv_board_bus
his 
wheelchair 
right 
up 
a

ramp

into 
a 
spot 
on 
the

where 
the

buckled RelNScrEv_bus
him

his

soon 
hannah 
's

told UnrelEv_bus
her 
she

pull ScrEv_press_stop_button
the 
cord 
to 
make UnrelEv_bus
the

stop ScrEv_bus_stops

up 
high

with 
a 
little 
help 
from 
her

she 
reached UnrelEv_bus
it

was UnrelEv_bus
a

to 
take+a+bus Evoking_bus
to 
visit UnrelEv_bus
my 
friends 
at

i 
checked ScrEv_check_time-table

my 
computer

around 
the 
time 
the 
bus 
would 
be ScrEv_bus_comes

, 
i 
walked ScrEv_get_bus_stop
from 
my 
house

the 
bus 
stop

i 
wanted ScrEv_wait
with 
other 
riders 
for 
the 
bus 
to 
arrive ScrEv_bus_comes

when 
it 
did ScrEv_bus_comes
, 
i 
boarded ScrEv_board_bus
the 
bus 
and 
paid ScrEv_get_ticket
for 
my 
ride 
with 
coins 
. 
i 
then 
took ScrEv_find_place
the 
first 
available 
seat 
towards 
the 
front 
of 
the 
bus 
. 
there 
was 
a 
older 
lady 
seated ScrEv_find_place
next 
to 
me 
and 
we 
had ScrEv_spend_time_bus
a 
nice 
conversation 
. 
the 
bus 
stopped ScrEv_bus_stops
at 
various 
locations 
and 
people 
got+on Unclear_bus
and 
off 
. 
when 
a 
pregnant 
woman 
got+on ScrEv_board_bus
the 
bus 
, 
i 
stood+up RelNScrEv_bus
and 
let UnrelEv_bus
her 
have ScrEv_find_place
my 
seat 
. 
i 
then 
stood ScrEv_find_place
and 
held ScrEv_find_place
the 
pole 
in 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
bus 
to 
keep RelNScrEv_bus
stable 
as 
the 
bus 
lurched RelNScrEv_bus
during 
it 
's 
starts 
and 
stops 
. 
before 
long 
, 
the 
bus 
arrived ScrEv_bus_stops
at 
the 
bus 
stop 
closest 
to 
the 
beach 
and 
i 
exited ScrEv_get_off
the

meet UnrelEv_bus
my 
friends 
. 
<end_of_story>_bus 
my 
car 
was UnrelEv_bus
in 
the 
shop 
, 
so 
today 
i 
decided UnrelEv_bus
to 
commute+to+school+on+a+public+bus Evoking_bus
. 
first 
, 
i 
looked+up ScrEv_check_time-table
what 
bus 
i 
would 
need UnrelEv_bus
. 
i 
found UnrelEv_bus
i 
need 
to 
take+two+buses Evoking_bus
and 
transfer ScrEv_change_bus
in 
the 
middle 
. 
i 
started UnrelEv_bus
walking ScrEv_get_bus_stop
to 
the 
first 
bus 
stop 
and 
arrived ScrEv_get_bus_stop
ten 
minutes 
before 
the 
bus 
was 
scheduled ScrEv_check_time-table
to 
arrive ScrEv_bus_comes
. 
it 
came ScrEv_bus_comes
on 
time 
, 
and 
the 
bus 
driver 
let+off ScrEv_get_off
the 
other 
passengers 
. 
i 
stepped+onto ScrEv_board_bus
the 
bus 
and 
paid ScrEv_get_ticket
the 
driver 
the 
fare 
. 
then 
i 
found ScrEv_find_place
an 
open 
seat 
by 
a 
window 
and 
sat+down ScrEv_find_place
. 
the 
ride 
was UnrelEv_bus
around 
523 
minutes 
or 
so 
. 
then 
the 
driver 
announced ScrEv_bus_stops
my 
stop 
. 
i 
headed+out ScrEv_get_off
the 
back 
doors 
. 
outside 
, 
i 
found UnrelEv_bus
a 
bench 
and 
sat+down ScrEv_wait
. 
the 
next 
bus 
came ScrEv_bus_comes
fairly 
quickly 
. 
i 
hopped+on ScrEv_board_bus
and 
showed ScrEv_get_ticket
the 
driver 
my 
transfer 
ticket 
. 
this 
time 
, 
the 
bus 
was 
packed RelNScrEv_bus
, 
so 
i 
found ScrEv_find_place
a 
pole 
and 
hung+on ScrEv_find_place
. 
the 
ride 
was UnrelEv_bus
n't 
too 
long 
, 
however 
, 
and 
soon 
i 
was+at ScrEv_bus_stops
my 
final 
destination 
. 
i 
found+my+way+off ScrEv_get_off
the 
bus 
and 
walked+over UnrelEv_bus
to 
school 
. 
<end_of_story>_bus 
today 
i 
rode+the+public+bus Evoking_bus
to 
work 
as 
i 
usually 
do Evoking_bus
. 
because 
i 
ride+several+busses Evoking_bus
daily 
, 
i 
had 
previously 
purchased ScrEv_get_ticket
a 
bus 
pass 
that 
allows+unlimited UnrelEv_bus
use 
for 
the 
month 
. 
by 
having RelNScrEv_bus
this 
pass 
i 
did 
n't 
need 
to 
worry UnrelEv_bus
about 
having UnrelEv_bus
proper 
change 
or 
tokens 
for 
the 
bus 
. 
i 
checked ScrEv_check_time-table
the 
schedule 
for 
my 
bus 
by 
using UnrelEv_bus
'' 
`` 
google 
maps 
'' 
'' 
and 
determined ScrEv_check_time-table
that 
my 
regular 
bus 
was RelNScrEv_bus
on 
schedule 
. 
i 
walked ScrEv_get_bus_stop
to 
the 
bus 
stop 
and 
saw UnrelEv_bus
that 
my 
bus 
was UnrelEv_bus
several 
blocks 
away 
. 
when 
the 
bus 
arrived ScrEv_bus_comes
i 
boarded ScrEv_board_bus
it 
after 
several 
other 
passengers 
, 
and 
then 
slid ScrEv_get_ticket
my 
pass 
through 
the 
card 
reader 
. 
there 
were UnrelEv_bus
several 
seats 
available 
and 
i 
selected ScrEv_find_place
the 
first 
one 
i 
came+to UnrelEv_bus
. 
the 
bus 
continued ScrEv_ride
on 
schedule 
along 
the 
route 
with 
passengers 
departing ScrEv_get_off
and 
boarding ScrEv_board_bus
. 
when 
i 
arrived ScrEv_bus_stops
at 
work 
i 
gathered RelNScrEv_bus
all 
of 
my 
personal 
belongings 
and 
disembarked ScrEv_get_off
. 
<end_of_story>_bus 
i 
exited UnrelEv_bus
my 
home 
and 
locked UnrelEv_bus
my 
front 
door 
. 
i 
walked+down UnrelEv_bus
my 
stoop 
stairs 
and 
turned UnrelEv_bus
left 
. 
the 
bus 
stop 
was ScrEv_get_bus_stop
three 
and 
a 
half 
blocks 
away 
. 
i 
checked RelNScrEv_bus
my 
watch 
. 
i 
had 
looked+up ScrEv_check_time-table
the 
bus 
schedule 
and 
the 
bus 
was 
supposed RelNScrEv_bus
to 
be 
arriving ScrEv_bus_comes
in 
ten 
minutes 
. 
i 
arrived ScrEv_get_bus_stop
at 
the 
bench 
with 
a 
few 
minutes 
to 
spare ScrEv_wait
. 
i 
sat RelNScrEv_bus
on 
the 
bench 
underneath 
the 
rain 
awning 
and 
read RelNScrEv_bus
my 
book 
until 
i 
noticed UnrelEv_bus
the 
bus 
approaching ScrEv_bus_comes
. 
i 
stood+up UnrelEv_bus
, 
closed UnrelEv_bus
my 
book 
, 
and 
fished+through RelNScrEv_bus
my 
purse 
for 
my 
metrocard 
. 
the 
bus 
pulled ScrEv_bus_comes
to 
a 
stop 
and 
the 
doors 
opened ScrEv_door_opens
. 
i 
climbed+up ScrEv_board_bus
the 
steps 
and 
pushed ScrEv_get_ticket
my 
metrocard 
into 
the 
automated UnrelEv_bus
ticket 
taker 
. 
the 
machine 
beeped ScrEv_get_ticket
and 
i 
read ScrEv_get_ticket
the 
digital 
display 
showing RelNScrEv_bus
me 
that 
i 
had 
some 
money 
left RelNScrEv_bus
on 
my 
card 
. 
i 
was UnrelEv_bus
glad 
to 
have 
enough 
left+over RelNScrEv_bus
for 
my 
return 
trip 
. 
i 
put RelNScrEv_bus
my 
metrocard 
away 
and 
walked ScrEv_find_place
toward 
the 
back 
of 
the 
bus 
. 
there 
was UnrelEv_bus
an 
empty 
seat 
near 
the 
window 
and 
i 
sat+down ScrEv_find_place
. 
i 
gazed ScrEv_spend_time_bus
out 
the 
window 
, 
choosing UnrelEv_bus
not 
to 
continue UnrelEv_bus
reading ScrEv_spend_time_bus
my 
book 
because 
it 
makes RelNScrEv_bus
me 
carsick 
. 
when 
the 
bus 
neared ScrEv_bus_stops
my 
destination 
, 
i 
pressed ScrEv_press_stop_button
the 
button 
to 
request ScrEv_press_stop_button
a 
stop 
. 
the 
bus 
stopped ScrEv_bus_stops
and 
i 
said RelNScrEv_bus
excuse 
me 
to 
a 
few 
fellow 
passengers 
as 
i 
made ScrEv_go_exit
my 
way 
to 
the 
back 
door 
. 
i 
touched ScrEv_other_bus
the 
tape 
on 
the 
doors 
and 
they 
opened ScrEv_door_opens
automatically 
. 
i 
gave RelNScrEv_bus
a 
wave 
of 
thanks 
to 
the 
bus 
driver 
and 
stepped+down ScrEv_get_off
carefully 
onto 
the 
curb 
. 
<end_of_story>_bus 
yesterday 
my 
car 
broke+down UnrelEv_bus
, 
so 
i 
was 
thinking UnrelEv_bus
of 
how 
i 
would 
get UnrelEv_bus
to 
work 
. 
i 
decided UnrelEv_bus
one 
of 
the 
best 
options 
would 
be UnrelEv_bus
to 
take+a+public+bus Evoking_bus
. 
since 
i 
've 
never 
taken+one Evoking_bus
before 
, 
i 
went UnrelEv_bus
to 
the 
city 
website 
and 
looked+at ScrEv_check_time-table
a 
schedule 
of 
all 
the 
bus 
times 
and 
routes 
. 
when 
i 
had 
finally 
decided+on ScrEv_find_bus
the 
bus 
that 
i 
needed 
to 
take Evoking_bus
, 
it 
was UnrelEv_bus
time 
to 
put UnrelEv_bus
my 
plan 
into 
action 
. 
i 
left ScrEv_get_bus_stop
my 
house 
and 
walked+over ScrEv_get_bus_stop
to 
the 
bus 
stop 
. 
there 
were UnrelEv_bus
a 
few 
other 
people 
waiting ScrEv_wait
there 
as 
well 
. 
when 
the 
bus 
arrived ScrEv_bus_comes
i 
got+on ScrEv_board_bus
and 
paid ScrEv_get_ticket
the 
driver 
the 
fee 
, 
which 
was UnrelEv_bus
$ 
523 
. 
i 
then 
sat+down ScrEv_find_place
and 
waited+for ScrEv_ride
the 
bus 
to 
arrive ScrEv_bus_stops
at 
my 
destination 
. 
it 
took RelNScrEv_bus
about 
523 
minutes 
to 
get ScrEv_ride
where 
i 
was 
going UnrelEv_bus
, 
and 
i 
arrived ScrEv_bus_stops
safely 
. 
i 
think UnrelEv_bus
that 
overall 
it 
was UnrelEv_bus
a 
pleasant 
experience 
. 
<end_of_story>_bus 
i 
stood ScrEv_wait
at 
the 
bus 
stop 
and 
consulted ScrEv_check_time-table
the 
bus 
timetable 
. 
my 
bus 
should 
be+there ScrEv_bus_comes
any 
minute 
. 
there 
were UnrelEv_bus
several 
people 
waiting ScrEv_wait
with 
me 
. 
we 
were 
standing RelNScrEv_bus
under 
the 
shelter 
, 
because 
it 
had 
started+raining UnrelEv_bus
. 
then 
i 
saw UnrelEv_bus
the 
bus 
arriving ScrEv_bus_comes
. 
it 
pulled+up ScrEv_bus_comes
to 
the 
bus 
stop 
and 
we 
all 
stood RelNScrEv_bus
in 
line 
to 
get+on ScrEv_board_bus
. 
i 
said RelNScrEv_bus
hello 
to 
the 
driver 
and 
paid ScrEv_get_ticket
my 
fare 
. 
then 
i 
found ScrEv_find_place
an 
empty 
seat 
at 
the 
back 
of 
the 
bus 
. 
i 
sat+down ScrEv_find_place
and 
looked+out ScrEv_spend_time_bus
the 
window 
at 
the 
city 
while 
we 
drove ScrEv_ride
. 
there 
were UnrelEv_bus
many 
stops 
and 
people 
getting+off Unclear_bus
and 
on 
. 
the 
bus 
grew UnrelEv_bus
so 
crowded RelNScrEv_bus
that 
someone 
came RelNScrEv_bus
and 
sat ScrEv_find_place
next 
to 
me 
. 
i 
scooted+over RelNScrEv_bus
to 
make RelNScrEv_bus
room 
and 
kept UnrelEv_bus
looking+out ScrEv_spend_time_bus
the 
window 
. 
finally 
it 
was ScrEv_bus_stops
my 
stop 
. 
i 
said RelNScrEv_bus
excuse 
me 
to 
the 
person 
sitting ScrEv_find_place
next 
to 
me 
, 
and 
he 
moved+over RelNScrEv_bus
to 
let UnrelEv_bus
me 
go+by RelNScrEv_bus
. 
i 
stood+up ScrEv_go_exit
and 
walked+off ScrEv_get_off
the 
bus 
. 
i 
had 
arrived ScrEv_bus_stops
at 
my 
location 
. 
<end_of_story>_bus 
where 
i 
live UnrelEv_bus
, 
i 
always 
need 
to 
take+a+public+bus Evoking_bus
to 
the 
train 
station 
to 
get+to ScrEv_ride
my 
destinations 
. 
the 
bus 
is UnrelEv_bus
not 
usually 
on 
schedule 
so 
sometimes 
this 
can 
be+frustrating UnrelEv_bus
especially 
on 
a 
cold 
winter 
day 
as 
you 
are 
waiting+for ScrEv_wait
a 
bus 
. 
since 
the 
discovery 
of 
a 
bustimes 
app 
on 
my 
iphone 
, 
i 
am 
able 
to 
know UnrelEv_bus
exactlly 
when 
my 
bus 
arrives ScrEv_bus_comes
using ScrEv_check_time-table
their 
gps 
technology 
. 
it 
is UnrelEv_bus
accurate 
most 
of 
the 
times 
. 
i 
get+ready UnrelEv_bus
to 
leave ScrEv_get_bus_stop
my 
house 
, 
look+at ScrEv_check_time-table
my 
bustimes 
app 
to 
see UnrelEv_bus
when 
the 
bus 
is 
arriving ScrEv_bus_comes
, 
and 
then 
leave ScrEv_get_bus_stop
my 
house 
to 
catch ScrEv_board_bus
the 
bus 
without 
wasting UnrelEv_bus
my 
time 
waiting+for ScrEv_wait
the 
bus 
. 
i 
pay ScrEv_get_ticket
the 
fare 
getting+on ScrEv_board_bus
the 
bus 
, 
greet RelNScrEv_bus
the 
driver 
with 
a 
smile 
, 
and 
find ScrEv_find_place
a 
seat 
to 
sit+down ScrEv_find_place
. 
it 
is UnrelEv_bus
a 
short 
ride 
to 
my 
train 
station 
where 
i 
can 
get+on UnrelEv_bus
the 
train 
to 
my 
final 
destination 
. 
<end_of_story>_bus 
last 
year 
i 
got UnrelEv_bus
a 
job 
in 
downtown 
atlanta 
. 
i 
live UnrelEv_bus
523 
miles 
from 
the 
downtown 
. 
so 
during 
commute 
hours 
it 
takes UnrelEv_bus
1-1 
523 
hours 
to 
get+to UnrelEv_bus
job 
. 
in 
a 
day 
, 
i 
'll 
be 
spending UnrelEv_bus
523 
hours 
in 
car 
with 
nothing 
else 
to 
do UnrelEv_bus
. 
so 
i 
started+thinking UnrelEv_bus
about 
alternatives 
. 
how 
about 
taking+public+transport Evoking_bus
? 
i 
checked ScrEv_check_time-table
online 
and 
found ScrEv_find_bus
a 
route 
which 
is UnrelEv_bus
closer 
to 
where 
i 
live UnrelEv_bus
. 
i 
found ScrEv_find_bus
that 
the 
best 
stop 
was UnrelEv_bus
right 
in 
front 
of 
my 
apartment 
complex 
which 
i 
had 
never 
noticed UnrelEv_bus
before 
. 
i 
started+waking+up UnrelEv_bus
by 
6:30 
. 
by 
523 
, 
i 
'll 
reach ScrEv_get_bus_stop
the 
bus 
stop 
. 
the 
bus 
will 
come ScrEv_bus_comes
sharp 
at 
7:10 
. 
i 
need 
to 
swipe ScrEv_get_ticket
the 
transport 
's 
card 
or 
pay ScrEv_get_ticket
in 
cash 
when 
i 
get+into ScrEv_board_bus
the 
bus 
. 
usually 
there 
will 
be ScrEv_find_place
couple 
of 
seats 
vacant 
so 
i 
do 
n't 
need 
to 
stand ScrEv_find_place
. 
i 
will 
either 
sleep ScrEv_spend_time_bus
or 
read ScrEv_spend_time_bus
a 
book 
for 
the 
entire 
journey 
. 
or 
i 
could 
talk ScrEv_spend_time_bus
to 
passengers 
. 
overall 
it 
was UnrelEv_bus
a 
nice 
experience 
. 
<end_of_story>_bus 
yesterday 
i 
rode+the+bus Evoking_bus
to 
work 
, 
because 
my 
car 
had 
broken+down UnrelEv_bus
. 
the 
night 
before 
i 
used UnrelEv_bus
the 
internet 
to 
find+out ScrEv_check_time-table
what 
time 
the 
bus 
would 
be 
arriving ScrEv_bus_comes
at 
the 
stop 
nearest 
my 
house 
, 
and 
made UnrelEv_bus
plans 
to 
leave ScrEv_get_bus_stop
the 
house 
early 
so 
i 
could 
be+at ScrEv_get_bus_stop
the 
bus 
stop 
on 
time 
. 
i 
made+sure UnrelEv_bus
to 
leave ScrEv_get_bus_stop
a 
bit 
earlier 
than 
i 
thought UnrelEv_bus
would 
be UnrelEv_bus
necessary 
, 
just 
in 
case 
something 
came+up UnrelEv_bus
that 
might 
make UnrelEv_bus
me 
late 
. 
when 
i 
arrived+at ScrEv_get_bus_stop
the 
bus 
stop 
, 
i 
sat+down ScrEv_wait
on 
the 
bench 
and 
waited+for ScrEv_wait
the 
bus 
to 
arrive ScrEv_bus_comes
. 
it 
was RelNScrEv_bus
right 
on 
time 
! 
the 
doors 
to 
the 
bus 
opened ScrEv_door_opens
, 
and 
i 
asked RelNScrEv_bus
the 
lady 
behind 
the 
wheel 
how 
much 
an 
all 
day 
pass 
was UnrelEv_bus
. 
she 
told RelNScrEv_bus
me 
it 
would 
be UnrelEv_bus
$ 
523 
, 
so 
i 
took RelNScrEv_bus
some 
money 
out 
of 
my 
wallet 
and 
placed ScrEv_get_ticket
it 
into 
the 
collection 
tray 
. 
i 
then 
walked RelNScrEv_bus
to 
the 
back 
of 
the 
bus 
and 
picked ScrEv_find_place
a 
seat 
that 
looked UnrelEv_bus
comfortable 
. 
after 
everyone 
else 
had 
sat+down ScrEv_find_place
, 
the 
bus 
began UnrelEv_bus
to 
move ScrEv_ride
. 
when 
i 
saw UnrelEv_bus
that 
i 
was 
getting+close ScrEv_bus_stops
to 
work 
, 
i 
grabbed ScrEv_press_stop_button
the 
yellow 
cord 
above 
my 
head 
and 
pulled ScrEv_press_stop_button
, 
which 
caused UnrelEv_bus
a 
light 
to 
flash RelNScrEv_bus
and 
a 
bell 
to 
ring RelNScrEv_bus
, 
signalling RelNScrEv_bus
the 
bus 
driver 
that 
i 
wanted+to UnrelEv_bus
get+off ScrEv_get_off
at 
the 
next 
stop 
. 
the 
bus 
then 
pulled+over ScrEv_bus_stops
at 
the 
next 
stop 
, 
and 
i 
thanked RelNScrEv_bus
the 
driver 
and 
got+off ScrEv_get_off
. 
<end_of_story>_bus 
the 
trick 
to 
getting+around UnrelEv_bus
an 
island 
as 
congested UnrelEv_bus
with 
traffic 
as 
oahu 
, 
is UnrelEv_bus
to 
ride+the+public+bus Evoking_bus
. 
there 
are UnrelEv_bus
too 
many 
cars 
, 
in 
too 
small 
of 
an 
area 
, 
and 
the 
result 
is UnrelEv_bus
hours 
of 
gridlock 
on 
the 
roads 
. 
the 
bus 
can 
use UnrelEv_bus
special 
lanes 
, 
and 
helps+reduce UnrelEv_bus
the 
overall 
traffic 
. 
learning UnrelEv_bus
to 
ride+the+public+bus Evoking_bus
was UnrelEv_bus
a 
little 
stressful 
at 
first 
. 
i 
studied ScrEv_check_time-table
bus 
routes 
online 
on 
their 
website 
, 
there 
are UnrelEv_bus
quite 
a 
few 
and 
it 
seemed UnrelEv_bus
like 
it 
'd 
be UnrelEv_bus
easy 
to 
get+on ScrEv_board_bus
the 
wrong 
bus 
. 
i 
learned UnrelEv_bus
each 
bus 
has UnrelEv_bus
a 
number 
assigned+to UnrelEv_bus
it 
and 
displayed UnrelEv_bus
on 
the 
front 
though 
. 
with 
that 
in 
mind 
, 
and 
armed UnrelEv_bus
with 
maps 
, 
i 
learned UnrelEv_bus
to 
stand ScrEv_wait
at 
my 
local 
bus 
stop 
and 
climb ScrEv_board_bus
on 
board 
where 
i 
drop ScrEv_get_ticket
my 
change 
into 
the 
toll 
taker 
next 
to 
the 
driver 
. 
i 
always 
look+for ScrEv_find_place
an 
empty 
seat 
, 
and 
then 
relax ScrEv_spend_time_bus
, 
watching ScrEv_spend_time_bus
the 
scenery 
roll+by RelNScrEv_bus
. 
as 
my 
stop 
approaches ScrEv_bus_stops
, 
i 
stand RelNScrEv_bus
and 
pull ScrEv_press_stop_button
the 
bell 
, 
and 
the 
driver 
stops ScrEv_bus_stops
the 
bus 
. 
now 
that 
i 
regularly 
ride+the+public+bus Evoking_bus
, 
i 
find UnrelEv_bus
i 
do 
n't 
mind UnrelEv_bus
the 
long 
commute 
nearly 
as 
much 
! 
<end_of_story>_bus 
last 
week 
, 
my 
friend 
and 
i 
rode+the+public+bus Evoking_bus
into 
town 
. 
we 
looked+at ScrEv_check_time-table
a 
bus 
schedule 
and 
found ScrEv_find_bus
the 
bus 
stop 
closest 
to 
our 
homes 
. 
we 
got+to ScrEv_get_bus_stop
the 
bus 
stop 
ten 
minutes 
before 
our 
bus 
was 
supposed UnrelEv_bus
to 
arrive ScrEv_bus_comes
and 
waited ScrEv_wait
. 
when 
it 
arrived ScrEv_bus_comes
, 
we 
got+into RelNScrEv_bus
the 
line 
to 
board ScrEv_board_bus
. 
each 
person 
in 
front 
of 
us 
climbed ScrEv_board_bus
the 
steps 
and 
put ScrEv_get_ticket
a 
token 
into 
the 
machine 
at 
the 
front 
of 
the 
bus 
. 
we 
had UnrelEv_bus
no 
token 
, 
so 
we 
gave ScrEv_get_ticket
the 
bus 
driver 
our 
money 
and 
he 
gave ScrEv_get_ticket
us 
tokens 
to 
put+in ScrEv_get_ticket
. 
we 
found ScrEv_find_place
a 
seat 
at 
the 
back 
of 
the 
bus 
and 
sat+down ScrEv_find_place
. 
we 
checked ScrEv_check_time-table
our 
bus 
schedule 
and 
decided ScrEv_find_bus
where 
we 
wanted 
to 
get+off ScrEv_get_off
. 
when 
the 
sign 
at 
the 
front 
of 
the 
bus 
showed RelNScrEv_bus
that 
it 
was ScrEv_bus_stops
our 
stop 
, 
we 
gathered RelNScrEv_bus
our 
things 
and 
prepared ScrEv_go_exit
to 
get+off ScrEv_get_off
. 
after 
we 
got+off ScrEv_get_off
, 
we 
made UnrelEv_bus
a 
note 
of 
which 
bus 
stop 
we 
were UnrelEv_bus
at 
and 
the 
time 
the 
bus 
would 
be ScrEv_bus_comes
there 
again 
to 
take+us+home Evoking_bus
. 
then 
we 
went+off UnrelEv_bus
to 
explore UnrelEv_bus
the 
town 
. 
<end_of_story>_bus 
today 
is UnrelEv_bus
the 
first 
day 
for 
my 
new 
job 
. 
this 
new 
job 
is UnrelEv_bus
near 
the 
center 
of 
the 
city 
an 
parking+is UnrelEv_bus
horrible 
. 
so 
i 
decided UnrelEv_bus
the 
best 
thing 
to 
do+was UnrelEv_bus
take+a+bus Evoking_bus
to 
work 
. 
i 
got ScrEv_check_time-table
a 
bus 
schedule 
and 
found ScrEv_find_bus
the 
nearest 
bus 
stop 
to 
my 
house 
and 
went+over ScrEv_check_time-table
the 
times 
of 
the 
buses 
. 
. 
since 
i 
would 
have 
to 
take+2+buses Evoking_bus
to 
get+to UnrelEv_bus
work 
i 
had 
to 
make+sure UnrelEv_bus
of 
the 
i 
would 
be 
able+to UnrelEv_bus
meet ScrEv_change_bus
the 
next 
bus 
and 
get+to UnrelEv_bus
work 
on 
time 
. 
as 
i 
waited ScrEv_wait
on 
the 
corner 
for 
my 
bus 
, 
a 
few 
other 
people 
came+up ScrEv_get_bus_stop
to 
wait ScrEv_wait
also 
. 
the 
bus 
pulled+up ScrEv_bus_comes
and 
we 
all 
boarded ScrEv_board_bus
and 
paid ScrEv_get_ticket
our 
fare 
and 
i 
got ScrEv_get_ticket
a 
transfer 
for 
the 
second 
bus 
. 
as 
the 
bus 
was RelNScrEv_bus
in 
route 
i 
decided UnrelEv_bus
to 
read ScrEv_spend_time_bus
my 
paper 
. 
i 
happened UnrelEv_bus
to 
look+up UnrelEv_bus
and 
notice UnrelEv_bus
that 
i 
was+close ScrEv_bus_stops
to 
my 
stop 
so 
i 
pulled ScrEv_press_stop_button
the 
cord 
to 
let UnrelEv_bus
the 
bus 
driver 
know UnrelEv_bus
i 
wanted UnrelEv_bus
to 
get+off ScrEv_get_off
, 
he 
pulled+over ScrEv_bus_stops
and 
wished RelNScrEv_bus
me 
a 
good 
day 
and 
i 
in 
kind 
said RelNScrEv_bus
the 
same 
to 
him 
. 
i 
waited ScrEv_wait
a 
few 
moments 
for 
the 
next 
bus 
, 
as 
i 
board ScrEv_board_bus
the 
next 
bus 
, 
and 
sat+down ScrEv_find_place
i 
pulled+out ScrEv_spend_time_bus
my 
newspaper 
and 
finished UnrelEv_bus
reading ScrEv_spend_time_bus
the 
news 
. 
the 
bus 
let ScrEv_get_off
me 
off 
a 
half 
a 
block 
from 
my 
new 
job 
, 
as 
i 
walked UnrelEv_bus
the 
short 
way 
i 
thought UnrelEv_bus
this 
will 
not 
be UnrelEv_bus
so 
bad 
, 
a 
bit 
more 
time 
to 
get+to UnrelEv_bus
work 
but 
i 
liked UnrelEv_bus
riding+the+bus Evoking_bus
. 
<end_of_story>_bus 
as 
my 
car 
was 
not 
working UnrelEv_bus
correctly 
i 
decided UnrelEv_bus
to 
take+a+public+bus Evoking_bus
. 
i 
called RelNScrEv_bus
the 
bus 
depot 
and 
asked RelNScrEv_bus
how 
much 
tickets 
where UnrelEv_bus
and 
the 
departure 
times 
. 
the 
rates 
where UnrelEv_bus
reasonable 
for 
what 
i 
needed UnrelEv_bus
and 
i 
really 
did 
n't 
have UnrelEv_bus
a 
choice 
in 
the 
matter 
as 
my 
own 
car 
was UnrelEv_bus
messed 
up 
. 
i 
had 
a 
friend 
take ScrEv_get_bus_stop
me 
to 
the 
bus 
stop 
where 
i 
purchased ScrEv_get_ticket
my 
round 
trip 
ticket 
and 
prepared UnrelEv_bus
to 
wait ScrEv_wait
for 
the 
bus 
to 
load ScrEv_board_bus
and 
leave ScrEv_bus_leaves
to 
take ScrEv_ride
me 
to 
my 
destination 
. 
i 
went UnrelEv_bus
to 
the 
restroom 
to 
double 
check UnrelEv_bus
my 
concealed UnrelEv_bus
handgun 
and 
make+sure UnrelEv_bus
it 
was 
cocked UnrelEv_bus
, 
locked UnrelEv_bus
, 
and 
loaded UnrelEv_bus
as 
you 
can 
never 
be UnrelEv_bus
too 
safe 
. 
my 
gun 
was UnrelEv_bus
fine 
so 
i 
tucked UnrelEv_bus
it 
under 
my 
shirt 
and 
boarded ScrEv_board_bus
the 
bus 
. 
i 
found ScrEv_find_bus
a 
seat 
near 
the 
back 
where 
i 
could 
see ScrEv_spend_time_bus
most 
of 
the 
other 
passengers 
and 
kicked+back Unclear_bus
to 
make ScrEv_ride
the 
trip 
. 
<end_of_story>_bus 
i 
was UnrelEv_bus
very 
excited 
to 
go 
visit RelNScrEv_bus
my 
friend 
in 
the 
city 
. 
i 
needed 
to 
take+a+bus Evoking_bus
there 
so 
i 
went+online RelNScrEv_bus
the 
night 
before 
to 
plan ScrEv_check_time-table
my 
route 
. 
my 
parents 
dropped ScrEv_get_bus_stop
me 
off 
at 
the 
bus 
stop 
and 
i 
went ScrEv_get_ticket
to 
the 
ticket 
machine 
to 
get ScrEv_get_ticket
a 
metrocard 
. 
i 
sat+down RelNScrEv_bus
on 
a 
bench 
and 
waited ScrEv_wait
for 
the 
bus 
to 
arrive ScrEv_bus_comes
. 
after 
a 
few 
minutes 
the 
big 
bus 
arrived ScrEv_bus_comes
and 
opened ScrEv_door_opens
its 
doors 
. 
as 
i 
walked ScrEv_board_bus
up 
the 
stairs 
i 
said RelNScrEv_bus
hello 
to 
the 
bus 
driver 
. 
i 
took+out RelNScrEv_bus
my 
metrocard 
and 
swiped RelNScrEv_bus
it 
in 
the 
slot 
. 
i 
asked RelNScrEv_bus
the 
driver 
how 
long 
until 
my 
stop 
and 
he 
said RelNScrEv_bus
it 
was UnrelEv_bus
the 
fifth 
stop 
and 
would 
take ScrEv_ride
about 
forty 
minutes 
. 
after 
forty 
minutes 
it 
was UnrelEv_bus
time 
for 
me 
to 
get+off ScrEv_get_off
the 
bus 
. 
the 
bus 
driver 
told RelNScrEv_bus
me 
to 
have UnrelEv_bus
a 
good 
day 
and 
i 
got+off ScrEv_get_off
the 
bus 
. 
i 
could 
see UnrelEv_bus
my 
friend 
mickey 
waving UnrelEv_bus
to 
me 
across 
the 
street 
. 
<end_of_story>_bus 
one 
afternoon 
, 
i 
decided UnrelEv_bus
to 
go UnrelEv_bus
to 
the 
library 
to 
check+out UnrelEv_bus
some 
books 
and 
movies 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_bus
too 
far 
away 
to 
walk UnrelEv_bus
, 
so 
i 
decided UnrelEv_bus
to 
ride+the+bus Evoking_bus
. 
i 
found UnrelEv_bus
a 
map 
and 
looked UnrelEv_bus
for 
my 
home 
and 
the 
library 
. 
on 
the 
map 
, 
there 
was UnrelEv_bus
a 
symbol 
that 
stood UnrelEv_bus
for 
'' 
`` 
bus 
'' 
'' 
at 
a 
street 
corner 
a 
block 
from 
where 
i 
lived UnrelEv_bus
. 
there 
was UnrelEv_bus
another 
symbol 
for 
the 
bus 
on 
the 
road 
right 
in 
front 
of 
the 
library 
. 
i 
looked+up ScrEv_find_bus
the 
name 
of 
each 
of 
these 
stops 
on 
the 
map 
, 
and 
it 
said UnrelEv_bus
that 
the 
number 
523 
bus 
goes RelNScrEv_bus
to 
both 
of 
these 
stops 
. 
it 
also 
listed UnrelEv_bus
what 
times 
the 
number 
523 
bus 
arrives ScrEv_bus_comes
at 
each 
of 
these 
stops 
. 
when 
it 
was UnrelEv_bus
a 
few 
minutes 
before 
the 
bus 
was+due UnrelEv_bus
to 
arrive ScrEv_bus_comes
at 
the 
stop 
at 
my 
street 
corner 
, 
i 
checked RelNScrEv_bus
my 
piggy 
bank 
and 
took+out UnrelEv_bus
some 
dollar 
bills 
and 
quarters 
, 
and 
then 
i 
walked ScrEv_get_bus_stop
to 
the 
bus 
stop 
. 
after 
waiting ScrEv_wait
for 
a 
few 
minutes 
, 
a 
big 
bus 
that 
said UnrelEv_bus
'' 
`` 
number 
523 
'' 
'' 
pulled+up ScrEv_bus_comes
, 
and 
the 
driver 
opened ScrEv_door_opens
the 
door 
. 
i 
walked+on ScrEv_board_bus
and 
read RelNScrEv_bus
the 
sign 
explaining UnrelEv_bus
the 
fare 
. 
i 
paid ScrEv_get_ticket
exactly 
what 
the 
sign 
said UnrelEv_bus
into 
the 
machine 
near 
the 
driver 
and 
found ScrEv_find_place
a 
seat 
near 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
bus 
. 
as 
the 
bus 
drove ScrEv_ride
down 
the 
road 
, 
the 
names 
of 
each 
stop 
appeared RelNScrEv_bus
in 
writing 
near 
the 
front 
of 
the 
bus 
. 
an 
electronic 
voice 
also 
said RelNScrEv_bus
the 
names 
out 
loud 
so 
that 
the 
deaf 
would 
know UnrelEv_bus
what 
stop 
they 
are 
approaching ScrEv_other_bus
. 
sometimes 
the 
bus 
driver 
would 
stop ScrEv_bus_stops
and 
let ScrEv_board_bus
more 
people 
on 
board 
, 
and 
sometimes 
people 
got+off ScrEv_get_off
. 
sometimes 
there 
was 
nobody 
waiting ScrEv_wait
at 
a 
stop 
and 
nobody 
trying UnrelEv_bus
to 
get+off ScrEv_get_off
, 
so 
the 
driver 
kept+on UnrelEv_bus
moving ScrEv_ride
. 
when 
i 
saw RelNScrEv_bus
the 
name 
of 
the 
stop 
outside 
the 
library 
appear RelNScrEv_bus
, 
i 
pulled ScrEv_press_stop_button
a 
big 
yellow 
cord 
hanging UnrelEv_bus
above 
the 
window 
. 
this 
made ScrEv_press_stop_button
a 
noise 
and 
notified ScrEv_press_stop_button
the 
bus 
driver 
that 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_bus
to 
get+off ScrEv_get_off
at 
this 
stop 
. 
he 
stopped ScrEv_bus_stops
the 
bus 
when 
we 
arrived ScrEv_bus_stops
, 
opened ScrEv_door_opens
the 
doors 
, 
and 
i 
got+off ScrEv_get_off
to 
enjoy UnrelEv_bus
my 
afternoon 
at 
the 
library 
. 
<end_of_story>_bus 
i 
walked ScrEv_get_bus_stop
to 
the 
bus 
stop 
near 
my 
home 
so 
that 
i 
could 
get RelNScrEv_bus
to 
work 
. 
i 
brought+along UnrelEv_bus
my 
purse 
which 
had UnrelEv_bus
my 
bus 
card 
in 
it 
so 
that 
i 
could 
ride Evoking_bus
without 
paying ScrEv_get_ticket
cash 
. 
it 
only 
took UnrelEv_bus
a 
few 
minutes 
for 
the 
noisy 
bus 
to 
arrive ScrEv_bus_comes
. 
it 
stopped ScrEv_bus_stops
at 
the 
bus 
stop 
and 
the 
door 
opened ScrEv_door_opens
. 
the 
bus 
driver 
scanned RelNScrEv_bus
my 
bus 
card 
and 
i 
walked ScrEv_find_place
to 
an 
empty 
bench 
near 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
bus 
. 
many 
other 
passengers 
boarded ScrEv_board_bus
the 
bus 
after 
me 
and 
soon 
the 
bus 
was UnrelEv_bus
nearly 
full 
. 
looking ScrEv_spend_time_bus
around 
me 
, 
i 
saw ScrEv_spend_time_bus
a 
number 
of 
senior 
citizens 
as 
well 
as 
other 
young 
adults 
. 
there 
was UnrelEv_bus
even 
a 
woman 
with 
a 
sleeping UnrelEv_bus
baby 
sitting ScrEv_spend_time_bus
on 
the 
bus 
near 
my 
bench 
. 
i 
decided UnrelEv_bus
to 
listen ScrEv_spend_time_bus
to 
music 
on 
my 
smart 
phone 
while 
i 
waited ScrEv_spend_time_bus
for 
the 
bus 
to 
reach ScrEv_bus_stops
my 
destination 
. 
the 
bus 
stopped ScrEv_bus_stops
every 
few 
minutes 
to 
let Unclear_bus
other 
passengers 
on 
and 
off 
of 
the 
bus 
. 
after 
about 
an 
hour 
, 
the 
bus 
stopped ScrEv_bus_stops
at 
my 
bus 
stop 
and 
i 
got+up ScrEv_go_exit
and 
walked ScrEv_get_off
out 
of 
the 
bus 
, 
wishing RelNScrEv_bus
the 
driver 
a 
good 
day 
. 
<end_of_story>_bus 
the 
first 
time 
i 
rode+a+public+bus Evoking_bus
was UnrelEv_bus
in 
high 
school 
. 
i 
needed UnrelEv_bus
a 
ride 
to 
get RelNScrEv_bus
home 
from 
school 
since 
no 
family 
members 
could 
get UnrelEv_bus
me 
. 
so 
i 
waited ScrEv_wait
for 
the 
bus 
until 
it 
came ScrEv_bus_comes
. 
then 
i 
stepped ScrEv_board_bus
onto 
the 
bus 
, 
i 
inserted ScrEv_get_ticket
the 
fee 
of 
two 
dollars 
into 
the 
cash 
machine 
and 
the 
driver 
waived RelNScrEv_bus
me 
on 
. 
i 
went ScrEv_find_place
and 
took ScrEv_find_place
my 
seat 
and 
minded ScrEv_spend_time_bus
my 
own 
business 
. 
once 
the 
bus 
was ScrEv_ride
on 
its 
way 
, 
i 
waited ScrEv_spend_time_bus
until 
we 
were UnrelEv_bus
close 
to 
my 
house 
. 
i 
then 
pulled ScrEv_press_stop_button
on 
the 
yellow 
stop 
cord 
that 
is 
hung UnrelEv_bus
throughout 
the 
bus 
. 
it 
sends ScrEv_press_stop_button
a 
message 
to 
the 
driver 
that 
someone 
on 
the 
bus 
wants UnrelEv_bus
to 
get+off ScrEv_get_off
at 
the 
next 
stop 
. 
when 
the 
driver 
pulled ScrEv_bus_stops
up 
to 
a 
stop 
, 
i 
got+off ScrEv_get_off
, 
i 
said RelNScrEv_bus
thank 
you 
to 
the 
driver 
to 
be UnrelEv_bus
polite 
and 
grateful 
and 
he 
nodded RelNScrEv_bus
his 
head 
at 
me 
. 
then 
i 
walked UnrelEv_bus
the 
rest 
of 
the 
way 
home 
. 
i 
had 
always 
thought UnrelEv_bus
it 
would 
be UnrelEv_bus
hard 
and 
gross 
to 
take+a+public+bus Evoking_bus
, 
but 
it 
was UnrelEv_bus
actually 
kind 
of 
nice 
. 
there 
are UnrelEv_bus
also 
seat 
belts 
on 
public 
buses 
, 
but 
you 
are 
not 
required UnrelEv_bus
to 
wear UnrelEv_bus
one 
if 
you 
do 
not 
want UnrelEv_bus
to 
. 
<end_of_story>_bus 
i 
live UnrelEv_bus
in 
a 
city 
where 
there 
is UnrelEv_bus
never 
enough 
parking 
. 
because 
of 
this 
, 
i 
like UnrelEv_bus
to 
take+the+bus Evoking_bus
. 
if 
you 
know UnrelEv_bus
what 
bus 
to 
take Unclear_bus
, 
you 
can 
get RelNScrEv_bus
almost 
anywhere 
! 
today 
i 
needed 
to 
go RelNScrEv_bus
to 
the 
grocery 
store 
to 
get UnrelEv_bus
ingredients 
for 
dinner 
. 
happily 
, 
there 
is UnrelEv_bus
a 
bus 
stop 
only 
a 
block 
from 
my 
apartment 
. 
before 
i 
left UnrelEv_bus
the 
house 
i 
made+sure UnrelEv_bus
to 
check RelNScrEv_bus
if 
i 
had UnrelEv_bus
my 
bus 
pass 
. 
my 
pass 
allows UnrelEv_bus
me 
to 
ride+the+bus Evoking_bus
whenever 
i 
want UnrelEv_bus
! 
if 
i 
did 
n't 
have UnrelEv_bus
it 
, 
i 
would 
have 
to 
pay ScrEv_get_ticket
$ 
523 
for 
the 
ride 
. 
i 
waited ScrEv_wait
at 
the 
bus 
stop 
for 
just 
a 
few 
minutes 
before 
a 
bus 
drove+by RelNScrEv_bus
. 
i 
did 
n't 
get+on ScrEv_board_bus
it 
, 
however 
, 
because 
it 
was UnrelEv_bus
the 
523 
bus 
. 
i 
know 
that 
i 
need 
to 
take Unclear_bus
the 
523 
or 
523 
to 
get RelNScrEv_bus
to 
the 
grocery 
store 
. 
finally 
an 
523 
bus 
stopped ScrEv_bus_stops
, 
and 
i 
got+on ScrEv_board_bus
, 
tapping RelNScrEv_bus
my 
bus 
pass 
onto 
a 
special 
box 
near 
the 
door 
. 
the 
driver 
started UnrelEv_bus
driving ScrEv_ride
down 
the 
street 
. 
we 
stopped ScrEv_bus_stops
a 
couple 
of 
times 
at 
lexington 
road 
and 
then 
drove 
street 
. 
sometimes 
people 
got+off ScrEv_get_off
the 
bus 
, 
and 
sometimes 
people 
got+on ScrEv_board_bus
. 
next 
it 
was UnrelEv_bus
my 
stop 
: 
broadway 
street 
. 
i 
thanked RelNScrEv_bus
the 
bus 
driver 
as 
i 
got+off ScrEv_get_off
. 
it 
's UnrelEv_bus
so 
much 
nicer 
to 
take+the+bus Evoking_bus
than 
walk UnrelEv_bus
all 
that 
way 
! 
<end_of_story>_bus 
every 
time 
i 
have 
to 
go RelNScrEv_bus
to 
school 
or 
work 
i 
have 
to 
always 
ride+a+public+bus Evoking_bus
. 
i 
have 
to 
make+sure UnrelEv_bus
that 
i 
am UnrelEv_bus
by 
the 
bus 
stop 
in 
order 
to 
catch RelNScrEv_bus
the 
bus 
on 
time 
. 
when 
i 
get+on ScrEv_board_bus
the 
bus 
, 
i 
have 
to 
pay ScrEv_get_ticket
the 
bus 
fare 
. 
i 
live UnrelEv_bus
in 
a 
big 
city 
, 
so 
there 
's UnrelEv_bus
always 
a 
lot 
of 
people 
needing 
to 
take+the+bus Evoking_bus
. 
therefore 
; 
sometimes 
i 
am UnrelEv_bus
not 
lucky 
to 
find ScrEv_find_place
a 
seat 
to 
sit ScrEv_spend_time_bus
on 
. 
in 
that 
case 
, 
i 
would 
have 
to 
stand+up ScrEv_spend_time_bus
. 
overall 
, 
riding+a+bus Evoking_bus
is UnrelEv_bus
not 
enjoyable 
because 
it 
tends UnrelEv_bus
to 
be UnrelEv_bus
dirty 
, 
people 
are UnrelEv_bus
very 
loud 
, 
and 
it 
is UnrelEv_bus
very 
crowded 
. 
not 
to 
mention UnrelEv_bus
, 
it 
always 
smells UnrelEv_bus
like 
urine 
. 
my 
commute 
is UnrelEv_bus
always 
a 
long 
one 
. 
i 
usually 
stay ScrEv_ride
on 
the 
bus 
for 
one 
hour 
. 
for 
that 
one 
hour 
on 
the 
bus 
, 
i 
listen ScrEv_spend_time_bus
to 
music 
or 
play ScrEv_spend_time_bus
on 
my 
cell 
phone 
. 
eventually 
, 
i 
get ScrEv_bus_stops
to 
my 
stop 
. 
i 
get+off ScrEv_get_off
the 
bus 
and 
reach RelNScrEv_bus
my 
destination 
. 
<end_of_story>_bus 
yesterday 
, 
i 
stood ScrEv_wait
at 
the 
bus 
stop 
for 
over 
twenty 
minutes 
waiting ScrEv_wait
for 
vta 
bus 
523 
to 
show+up ScrEv_bus_comes
at 
my 
stop 
at 
my 
community 
college 
. 
after 
the 
bus 
arrived ScrEv_bus_comes
at 
the 
stop 
, 
i 
scanned RelNScrEv_bus
my 
clipper 
card 
, 
which 
gives UnrelEv_bus
me 
unlimited 
vta 
bus 
rides 
as 
long 
as 
i 
pay ScrEv_get_ticket
my 
school 
fee 
of 
$ 
523 
at 
the 
start 
of 
the 
quarter 
. 
i 
walked ScrEv_find_place
past 
several 
people 
sitting ScrEv_spend_time_bus
in 
the 
first 
front 
rows 
and 
decided ScrEv_find_place
upon 
a 
window-seat 
near 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
bus 
. 
i 
pulled+out ScrEv_spend_time_bus
my 
headphones 
and 
started UnrelEv_bus
listening ScrEv_spend_time_bus
to 
my 
own 
music 
from 
my 
phone 
in 
order 
to 
pass ScrEv_spend_time_bus
the 
time 
. 
we 
took+off ScrEv_bus_leaves
five 
minutes 
later 
and 
arrived ScrEv_bus_stops
at 
the 
first 
stop 
in 
about 
five 
minutes 
. 
this 
is UnrelEv_bus
an 
express 
bus 
, 
meaning 
it 
takes ScrEv_bus_stops
limited 
stops 
. 
another 
five 
minutes 
later 
we 
arrived ScrEv_bus_stops
at 
the 
second 
stop 
, 
which 
was UnrelEv_bus
mine 
to 
get+off ScrEv_get_off
at 
. 
before 
arriving ScrEv_bus_stops
at 
the 
stop 
, 
i 
pulled ScrEv_press_stop_button
the 
cord 
to 
initiate ScrEv_press_stop_button
the 
voice 
recording 
which 
states RelNScrEv_bus
'' 
`` 
stop 
requested ScrEv_press_stop_button
'' 
'' 
. 
the 
bus 
driver 
pulled ScrEv_bus_stops
to 
the 
side 
, 
i 
grabbed RelNScrEv_bus
my 
backpack 
and 
all 
my 
other 
belongings 
and 
headed+off ScrEv_get_off
the 
bus 
. 
<end_of_story>_bus 
i 
often 
use+the+public+bus+system Evoking_bus
locally 
to 
get+around RelNScrEv_bus
town 
, 
as 
it 
is UnrelEv_bus
much 
cheaper 
than 
driving 
. 
before 
i 
leave RelNScrEv_bus
home 
, 
i 
always 
make+sure RelNScrEv_bus
that 
i 
have UnrelEv_bus
enough 
money 
to 
pay ScrEv_get_ticket
for 
riding+the+bus Evoking_bus
wherever 
i 
need 
to 
go RelNScrEv_bus
that 
day 
and 
back 
home 
. 
this 
is UnrelEv_bus
especially 
important 
if 
i 
am 
going 
to 
be 
buying UnrelEv_bus
anything 
else 
that 
day 
. 
some 
bus 
systems 
have UnrelEv_bus
a 
special 
price 
for 
certain 
groups 
, 
like 
students 
. 
i 
am 
able 
to 
use UnrelEv_bus
my 
student 
id 
card 
to 
get UnrelEv_bus
a 
discounted 
rate 
. 
i 
have UnrelEv_bus
a 
bus 
schedule 
at 
home 
where 
i 
can 
easily 
check ScrEv_check_time-table
it 
, 
but 
i 
have 
it 
memorized UnrelEv_bus
because 
i 
use UnrelEv_bus
it 
so 
much 
. 
i 
make+sure UnrelEv_bus
i 
leave RelNScrEv_bus
to 
go ScrEv_get_bus_stop
to 
the 
bus 
stop 
so 
that 
i 
get ScrEv_get_bus_stop
there 
about 
five 
minutes 
early 
. 
usually 
the 
bus 
is UnrelEv_bus
on 
time 
, 
as 
long 
as 
there 
have UnrelEv_bus
n't 
been 
any 
issues 
that 
day 
. 
when 
the 
bus 
arrives ScrEv_bus_comes
, 
i 
first 
check RelNScrEv_bus
that 
it 
is UnrelEv_bus
the 
bus 
number 
for 
where 
i 
want 
to 
go RelNScrEv_bus
, 
as 
different 
bus 
lines 
go RelNScrEv_bus
to 
different 
areas 
of 
the 
city 
. 
when 
i 
get+on ScrEv_board_bus
the 
bus 
, 
i 
have 
to 
show RelNScrEv_bus
my 
id 
and 
pay ScrEv_get_ticket
, 
and 
then 
i 
can 
go ScrEv_find_place
to 
a 
seat 
. 
sometimes 
the 
bus 
can 
be UnrelEv_bus
pretty 
full 
, 
and 
i 
have 
to 
sit ScrEv_spend_time_bus
next 
to 
someone 
else 
. 
a 
lot 
of 
the 
same 
people 
will 
often 
ride+the+bus Evoking_bus
with 
me 
, 
so 
i 
get+to+know UnrelEv_bus
them 
. 
i 
will 
sometimes 
bring UnrelEv_bus
a 
book 
with 
me 
to 
read ScrEv_spend_time_bus
while 
i 
ride+the+bus Evoking_bus
. 
i 
make+sure UnrelEv_bus
to 
pay RelNScrEv_bus
attention 
to 
what 
stop 
we 
are UnrelEv_bus
at 
, 
and 
start UnrelEv_bus
to 
prepare RelNScrEv_bus
one 
stop 
ahead 
of 
where 
i 
need 
to 
get+off ScrEv_get_off
the 
bus 
. 
once 
i 
arrive ScrEv_bus_stops
at 
my 
bus 
stop 
, 
i 
walk ScrEv_go_exit
to 
the 
front 
of 
the 
bus 
and 
thank RelNScrEv_bus
the 
driver 
, 
then 
hop+off ScrEv_get_off
and 
continue UnrelEv_bus
with 
whatever 
i 
need 
to 
do UnrelEv_bus
that 
day 
. 
<end_of_story>_bus 
this 
morning 
, 
i 
took+a+public+bus Evoking_bus
so 
i 
could 
go RelNScrEv_bus
to 
the 
beach 
. 
the 
bus 
fare 
is UnrelEv_bus
cheaper 
than 
a 
taxi 
. 
in 
my 
city 
, 
it 
costs RelNScrEv_bus
$ 
523 
to 
ride ScrEv_ride
. 
first 
, 
i 
waited ScrEv_wait
at 
the 
bus 
stop 
near 
to 
my 
house 
. 
when 
the 
bus 
stopped ScrEv_bus_comes
for 
me 
, 
i 
walked ScrEv_board_bus
up 
the 
steps 
, 
which 
are UnrelEv_bus
pretty 
high 
. 
i 
said RelNScrEv_bus
hello 
to 
the 
bus-driver 
and 
he 
gave RelNScrEv_bus
me 
a 
friendly 
smile 
. 
i 
paid ScrEv_get_ticket
my 
fare 
went UnrelEv_bus
to 
look ScrEv_find_place
for 
a 
seat 
. 
there 
are UnrelEv_bus
usually 
a 
lot 
of 
people 
riding Evoking_bus
, 
but 
today 
it 
was UnrelEv_bus
pretty 
empty 
. 
the 
bus 
began UnrelEv_bus
to 
move ScrEv_ride
, 
so 
i 
had 
to 
get ScrEv_spend_time_bus
my 
footing 
. 
i 
saw ScrEv_find_place
a 
good 
corner 
spot 
in 
the 
back 
and 
made ScrEv_find_place
my 
way 
. 
i 
was 
hanging+onto ScrEv_spend_time_bus
the 
poles 
because 
i 
did 
not 
want UnrelEv_bus
to 
fall+over RelNScrEv_bus
when 
the 
bus 
started UnrelEv_bus
to 
pick+up RelNScrEv_bus
speed 
. 
there 
was UnrelEv_bus
an 
older 
woman 
who 
i 
passed UnrelEv_bus
and 
she 
had UnrelEv_bus
about 
two 
bags 
with 
her 
and 
she 
was 
humming ScrEv_spend_time_bus
a 
quiet 
song 
. 
there 
were UnrelEv_bus
pen 
markings 
on 
the 
chair 
in 
front 
of 
me 
and 
a 
piece 
of 
gum 
stuck UnrelEv_bus
to 
the 
window 
. 
i 
sat+down ScrEv_find_place
, 
got ScrEv_spend_time_bus
a 
book 
out 
and 
read ScrEv_spend_time_bus
for 
a 
little 
while 
. 
people 
got Unclear_bus
on 
and 
off 
the 
bus 
while 
we 
drove ScrEv_ride
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_bus
a 
little 
bumpy 
. 
i 
knew UnrelEv_bus
my 
stop 
was 
coming+up RelNScrEv_bus
when 
i 
saw RelNScrEv_bus
the 
mall 
. 
the 
bus 
ride 
took UnrelEv_bus
about 
thirty 
minutes 
. 
i 
stood+up ScrEv_go_exit
to 
pull ScrEv_press_stop_button
the 
chord 
for 
my 
stop 
and 
a 
light 
at 
the 
front 
of 
the 
bus 
lit+up RelNScrEv_bus
bright 
red 
. 
the 
bus 
stopped ScrEv_bus_stops
and 
the 
doors 
opened ScrEv_door_opens
and 
i 
got+out ScrEv_get_off
from 
the 
back 
of 
the 
bus 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_bus
a 
nice 
, 
quick 
ride 
. 
<end_of_story>_bus 
i 
was 
going 
to 
meet+up RelNScrEv_bus
with 
my 
friends 
at 
the 
mall 
to 
watch UnrelEv_bus
a 
new 
movie 
that 
recently 
came+out UnrelEv_bus
. 
but 
, 
since 
the 
mall 
is UnrelEv_bus
pretty 
far 
away 
, 
i 
needed 
to 
take+the+bus Evoking_bus
. 
so 
, 
i 
went+online RelNScrEv_bus
to 
the 
bus 
' 
site 
to 
check ScrEv_check_time-table
the 
time 
that 
the 
mall 
route 
bus 
would 
be UnrelEv_bus
near 
my 
house 
. 
i 
marked RelNScrEv_bus
the 
times 
down 
on 
my 
phone 
and 
got+ready UnrelEv_bus
to 
leave UnrelEv_bus
. 
i 
sent UnrelEv_bus
a 
text 
to 
my 
friends 
and 
let UnrelEv_bus
them 
know UnrelEv_bus
that 
i 
could 
make UnrelEv_bus
it 
and 
that 
i 
'd 
been UnrelEv_bus
there 
soon 
. 
i 
grabbed UnrelEv_bus
my 
jacket 
, 
wallet 
, 
and 
made+sure UnrelEv_bus
to 
get ScrEv_get_ticket
my 
bus 
pass 
. 
i 
checked UnrelEv_bus
the 
time 
and 
set+off UnrelEv_bus
. 
i 
walked ScrEv_get_bus_stop
a 
few 
blocks 
to 
the 
bus 
stop 
and 
double 
checked UnrelEv_bus
the 
time 
. 
i 
had 
to 
wait ScrEv_wait
for 
a 
little 
bit 
, 
but 
it 
's UnrelEv_bus
always 
better 
to 
get ScrEv_get_bus_stop
to 
the 
stop 
early 
, 
since 
sometimes 
the 
bus 
is UnrelEv_bus
n't 
quite 
on 
schedule 
. 
the 
bus 
finally 
pulled+up ScrEv_bus_comes
and 
i 
got+on ScrEv_board_bus
. 
i 
swiped RelNScrEv_bus
my 
card 
and 
i 
found ScrEv_find_place
a 
decent 
seat 
. 
luckily 
, 
there 
were UnrelEv_bus
n't 
that 
many 
people 
on 
board 
and 
the 
stops 
were UnrelEv_bus
short 
. 
as 
the 
bus 
got ScrEv_ride
closer 
to 
the 
mall 
, 
and 
it 
was 
nearing RelNScrEv_bus
the 
stop 
, 
i 
pulled ScrEv_press_stop_button
on 
the 
line 
that 
let ScrEv_press_stop_button
the 
driver 
know ScrEv_press_stop_button
that 
she 
needed 
to 
let ScrEv_get_off
someone 
off 
. 
i 
made RelNScrEv_bus
it 
to 
the 
mall 
in 
good 
time 
and 
got 
to 
hang+out UnrelEv_bus
with 
my 
friends 
a 
bit 
before 
the 
movie 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_bus
a 
pretty 
good 
day 
. 
<end_of_story>_bus 
yesterday 
i 
had 
to 
go RelNScrEv_bus
across 
town 
to 
the 
library 
to 
return UnrelEv_bus
some 
books 
. 
all 
my 
friends 
were UnrelEv_bus
busy 
and 
my 
car 
was UnrelEv_bus
in 
for 
repairs 
, 
so 
i 
had 
to 
take+the+bus Evoking_bus
. 
first 
thing 
was 
to 
see ScrEv_find_bus
what 
bus 
i 
needed UnrelEv_bus
. 
i 
went UnrelEv_bus
over 
to 
my 
computer 
and 
pulled+up UnrelEv_bus
the 
bus 
schedules 
for 
my 
city 
. 
i 
found RelNScrEv_bus
the 
nearest 
bus 
stop 
and 
checked ScrEv_find_bus
the 
bus 
lines 
that 
stopped ScrEv_bus_stops
there 
, 
then 
looked RelNScrEv_bus
for 
the 
stop 
nearest 
the 
library 
. 
there 
was UnrelEv_bus
a 
bus 
that 
went RelNScrEv_bus
to 
both 
stops 
, 
so 
i 
would 
n't 
have 
to 
change ScrEv_change_bus
buses 
to 
get RelNScrEv_bus
there 
. 
next 
i 
found ScrEv_check_time-table
the 
next 
time 
the 
bus 
would 
be UnrelEv_bus
at 
the 
stop 
near 
my 
house 
, 
which 
was UnrelEv_bus
only 
523 
minutes 
from 
now 
. 
i 
grabbed UnrelEv_bus
the 
books 
and 
headed ScrEv_get_bus_stop
out 
to 
walk ScrEv_get_bus_stop
to 
the 
bus 
stop 
. 
i 
got ScrEv_get_bus_stop
to 
the 
stop 
about 
523 
minutes 
early 
and 
waited ScrEv_wait
for 
the 
bus 
to 
arrive ScrEv_bus_comes
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_bus
only 
523 
minutes 
late 
, 
which 
is UnrelEv_bus
n't 
too 
bad 
. 
i 
climbed ScrEv_board_bus
into 
the 
bus 
, 
paid ScrEv_get_ticket
the 
driver 
and 
found ScrEv_find_place
an 
empty 
seat 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_bus
a 
pretty 
nice 
day 
, 
so 
i 
just 
sat ScrEv_spend_time_bus
there 
looking ScrEv_spend_time_bus
out 
the 
window 
until 
we 
got ScrEv_bus_stops
to 
the 
stop 
by 
the 
library 
. 
i 
got+off ScrEv_get_off
the 
bus 
and 
went UnrelEv_bus
inside 
to 
return UnrelEv_bus
my 
books 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_bus
a 
good 
bus 
ride 
, 
no 
problems 
with 
traffic 
at 
all 
. 
<end_of_story>_bus 
do 
n't 
own UnrelEv_bus
a 
car 
? 
tired 
of 
walking UnrelEv_bus
around 
? 
well 
i 
have UnrelEv_bus
a 
perfect 
solution 
for 
you 
, 
and 
it 
's UnrelEv_bus
right 
under 
your 
nose 
. 
head ScrEv_get_bus_stop
to 
your 
local 
corner 
bus 
stop 
and 
travel RelNScrEv_bus
on 
another 
form 
of 
transportation 
! 
it 
's UnrelEv_bus
very 
simple 
if 
you 
live UnrelEv_bus
in 
an 
urban 
setting 
, 
and 
still 
pretty 
simple 
in 
the 
suburbs 
. 
a 
good 
resource 
first 
is UnrelEv_bus
to 
look+up ScrEv_check_time-table
a 
bus 
schedule 
on 
the 
internet 
. 
additionally 
, 
you 
could 
search ScrEv_find_bus
the 
sidewalks 
for 
prominent 
signage 
that 
indicates UnrelEv_bus
a 
bus 
will 
stop ScrEv_bus_stops
in 
your 
area 
. 
once 
you 
decide UnrelEv_bus
on 
where 
you 
want UnrelEv_bus
to 
go RelNScrEv_bus
, 
and 
the 
time 
at 
which 
the 
bus 
comes ScrEv_bus_comes
, 
just 
head ScrEv_get_bus_stop
out 
to 
this 
stop 
and 
simply 
wait ScrEv_wait
. 
a 
bus 
will 
eventually 
show+up ScrEv_bus_comes
where 
you 
can 
board ScrEv_board_bus
and 
pay ScrEv_get_ticket
directly 
to 
the 
bus 
driver 
. 
once 
paid ScrEv_get_ticket
, 
simply 
find ScrEv_find_place
an 
open 
seat 
and 
gaze ScrEv_spend_time_bus
out 
the 
window 
at 
the 
bustling 
of 
life 
that 
you 
are 
passing+by RelNScrEv_bus
. 
eventually 
you 
will 
arrive ScrEv_bus_stops
at 
your 
destination 
and 
can 
exit ScrEv_get_off
the 
bus 
. 
once 
you 
finish+running UnrelEv_bus
your 
errands 
simply 
return ScrEv_get_bus_stop
to 
another 
bus 
spot 
and 
find ScrEv_find_bus
a 
ride 
home 
. 
<end_of_story>_bus 
when 
riding+a+public+bus Evoking_bus
, 
i 
usually 
feel UnrelEv_bus
anxious 
so 
i 
try UnrelEv_bus
not 
to 
do UnrelEv_bus
it 
too 
often 
. 
i 
wait ScrEv_wait
at 
the 
bus 
stop 
until 
the 
bus 
i 
am 
looking UnrelEv_bus
to 
board ScrEv_board_bus
arrives ScrEv_bus_comes
. 
i 
usually 
walk ScrEv_get_bus_stop
to 
the 
bus 
stop 
. 
when 
the 
bus 
arrives ScrEv_board_bus
, 
i 
pay ScrEv_get_ticket
the 
fare 
and 
it 
. 
i 
usually 
hope UnrelEv_bus
that 
the 
bus 
will 
not 
be UnrelEv_bus
too 
full 
, 
since 
i 
do 
not 
like UnrelEv_bus
to 
sit ScrEv_spend_time_bus
with 
strangers 
. 
hopefully 
i 
can 
sit ScrEv_spend_time_bus
somewhere 
by 
myself 
. 
i 
sit+down ScrEv_find_place
and 
usually 
put+on ScrEv_spend_time_bus
some 
headphones 
so 
that 
no 
one 
tried UnrelEv_bus
to 
have ScrEv_spend_time_bus
a 
conversation 
with 
my 
. 
hopefully 
i 
was 
able 
to 
secure ScrEv_find_place
a 
window 
seat 
so 
i 
stare ScrEv_spend_time_bus
out 
the 
window 
while 
i 
wait ScrEv_spend_time_bus
to 
get RelNScrEv_bus
to 
my 
destination 
. 
i 
use UnrelEv_bus
a 
lot 
of 
hand 
sanitizer 
since 
buses 
skeeve UnrelEv_bus
me 
out 
. 
if 
i 
'm 
going 
to 
be ScrEv_spend_time_bus
on 
the 
bus 
for 
a 
long 
time 
, 
i 
will 
use UnrelEv_bus
a 
antibacterial 
wipe 
to 
clean UnrelEv_bus
around 
me 
. 
when 
we 
get ScrEv_bus_stops
to 
my 
destination 
i 
will 
be UnrelEv_bus
very 
relieve 
and 
leave RelNScrEv_bus
. 
<end_of_story>_bus 
never 
will 
i 
ever 
forget UnrelEv_bus
the 
first 
time 
my 
third 
grade 
class 
went UnrelEv_bus
on 
a 
field 
trip 
. 
that 
was UnrelEv_bus
the 
first 
day 
i 
ever 
took+a+bus Evoking_bus
other 
than 
a 
school 
bus 
. 
we 
had 
to 
get 
our 
permission 
slips 
signed UnrelEv_bus
and 
bring ScrEv_get_ticket
in 
$ 
523 
for 
a 
bus 
pass 
. 
when 
i 
first 
held UnrelEv_bus
my 
bus 
pass 
i 
wondered UnrelEv_bus
why 
people 
did 
n't 
just 
pay ScrEv_get_ticket
with 
cash 
. 
the 
day 
finally 
came UnrelEv_bus
for 
us 
to 
go RelNScrEv_bus
to 
the 
museum 
and 
we 
walked ScrEv_get_bus_stop
together 
as 
a 
class 
to 
the 
bus 
stop 
. 
we 
stood ScrEv_wait
there 
waiting ScrEv_wait
for 
about 
ten 
minutes 
for 
the 
bus 
to 
come ScrEv_bus_comes
. 
when 
it 
arrived ScrEv_bus_comes
people 
rushed+off ScrEv_get_off
and 
we 
boarded ScrEv_board_bus
one 
by 
one 
. 
we 
each 
swiped RelNScrEv_bus
our 
bus 
pass 
and 
searched ScrEv_find_place
for 
a 
seat 
. 
there 
were UnrelEv_bus
some 
people 
who 
took+up UnrelEv_bus
two 
seats 
and 
the 
aroma 
of 
breath 
lingered UnrelEv_bus
in 
the 
air 
. 
each 
stop 
a 
bell 
rang RelNScrEv_bus
letting ScrEv_press_stop_button
the 
driver 
know ScrEv_press_stop_button
passengers 
wanted UnrelEv_bus
to 
get+off ScrEv_get_off
. 
it 
took UnrelEv_bus
us 
ten 
stop 
to 
get ScrEv_ride
to 
the 
museum 
but 
it 
seemed UnrelEv_bus
like 
forever 
. 
my 
teacher 
pressed ScrEv_press_stop_button
the 
button 
and 
we 
all 
ran UnrelEv_bus
to 
the 
museum 
doors 
happy 
to 
be UnrelEv_bus
free 
. 
<end_of_story>_bus 
last 
friday 
, 
my 
car 
broke+down UnrelEv_bus
. 
i 
had 
to 
get RelNScrEv_bus
to 
work 
monday 
, 
so 
i 
decided UnrelEv_bus
to 
ride+the+public+bus Evoking_bus
since 
it 
ran RelNScrEv_bus
fairly 
close 
to 
my 
home 
and 
work 
both 
. 
monday 
morning 
i 
got+ready RelNScrEv_bus
early 
and 
set+off ScrEv_get_bus_stop
to 
wait ScrEv_wait
at 
the 
bus 
stop 
. 
after 
sitting ScrEv_wait
for 
quite 
a 
while 
, 
the 
bus 
finally 
pulled+up ScrEv_bus_comes
. 
i 
let 
others 
at 
the 
stop 
get+on ScrEv_board_bus
first 
, 
then 
i 
got+on ScrEv_board_bus
. 
i 
asked RelNScrEv_bus
the 
bus 
driver 
how 
much 
the 
fare 
was UnrelEv_bus
and 
he 
told RelNScrEv_bus
me 
. 
i 
paid ScrEv_get_ticket
the 
fare 
by 
sticking ScrEv_get_ticket
my 
money 
in 
the 
box 
near 
the 
bus 
driver 
, 
and 
walked ScrEv_find_place
to 
find ScrEv_find_place
a 
free 
seat 
. 
i 
found ScrEv_find_place
one 
near 
the 
back 
of 
the 
bus 
, 
and 
i 
sat+down ScrEv_find_place
. 
the 
bus 
ride 
was UnrelEv_bus
fairly 
quick 
and 
uneventful 
. 
i 
noted UnrelEv_bus
that 
the 
ride 
went ScrEv_ride
the 
same 
route 
that 
i 
did 
. 
once 
the 
bus 
stopped ScrEv_bus_stops
at 
the 
stop 
near 
my 
work 
, 
i 
disembarked ScrEv_get_off
. 
that 
's UnrelEv_bus
how 
i 
rode+the+public+bus Evoking_bus
. 
<end_of_story>_bus 
before 
leaving RelNScrEv_bus
my 
house 
, 
i 
check ScrEv_check_time-table
the 
bus 
schedule 
on 
the 
internet 
. 
i 
noticed ScrEv_check_time-table
the 
bus 
was 
running+late RelNScrEv_bus
today 
, 
but 
i 
went ScrEv_get_bus_stop
outside 
to 
wait ScrEv_wait
at 
the 
bus 
stop 
anyway 
. 
the 
bus 
actually 
arrived ScrEv_bus_comes
even 
later 
than 
it 
was 
estimated UnrelEv_bus
on 
the 
internet 
. 
i 
got+onto ScrEv_board_bus
the 
bus 
after 
the 
arriving Unclear_bus
passengers 
exited ScrEv_get_off
. 
i 
paid ScrEv_get_ticket
with 
exact 
change 
into 
the 
money 
collector 
. 
there 
were UnrelEv_bus
no 
empty 
seats 
on 
the 
bus 
and 
almost 
all 
the 
places 
to 
stand ScrEv_spend_time_bus
were UnrelEv_bus
full 
too 
. 
i 
found ScrEv_find_place
a 
spot 
next 
to 
a 
man 
who 
smelled UnrelEv_bus
like 
he 
was 
eating UnrelEv_bus
onions 
. 
for 
the 
next 
523 
blocks 
i 
had 
to 
smell UnrelEv_bus
him 
before 
he 
exited ScrEv_get_off
the 
bus 
. 
the 
next 
person 
who 
stood ScrEv_spend_time_bus
by 
me 
was UnrelEv_bus
a 
morbidly 
obese 
man 
who 
liked UnrelEv_bus
to 
talk ScrEv_spend_time_bus
about 
anything 
he 
could 
think UnrelEv_bus
of 
. 
i 
tried UnrelEv_bus
to 
just 
look ScrEv_spend_time_bus
out 
the 
window 
because 
it 
was UnrelEv_bus
so 
uncomfortable 
. 
finally 
, 
seven 
blocks 
later 
i 
was UnrelEv_bus
at 
my 
stop 
and 
i 
could 
not 
have 
been UnrelEv_bus
more 
relieved 
. 
<end_of_story>_bus 
i 
made UnrelEv_bus
plans 
to 
meet UnrelEv_bus
a 
friend 
in 
the 
city 
. 
normally 
i 
would 
drive UnrelEv_bus
but 
there 
is UnrelEv_bus
a 
lot 
of 
traffic 
and 
very 
little 
parking 
in 
the 
city 
so 
decided UnrelEv_bus
to 
take+the+bus Evoking_bus
. 
i 
made+sure RelNScrEv_bus
i 
had UnrelEv_bus
enough 
fare 
and 
left RelNScrEv_bus
the 
house 
. 
i 
walked ScrEv_get_bus_stop
to 
the 
bus 
stop 
and 
there 
was UnrelEv_bus
two 
elderly 
people 
waiting ScrEv_wait
before 
me 
. 
i 
waited ScrEv_wait
on 
line 
and 
short 
time 
later 
i 
saw UnrelEv_bus
the 
bus 
coming ScrEv_bus_comes
. 
the 
bus 
stopped ScrEv_bus_stops
in 
front 
of 
us 
and 
the 
elderly 
people 
got+on ScrEv_board_bus
first 
. 
i 
got+on ScrEv_board_bus
the 
bus 
after 
them 
and 
then 
paid ScrEv_get_ticket
my 
bus 
fare 
. 
i 
could 
n't 
find ScrEv_find_place
any 
seats 
so 
i 
held ScrEv_find_place
on 
the 
the 
metal 
handles 
provided UnrelEv_bus
in 
the 
bus 
so 
i 
would 
n't 
fall RelNScrEv_bus
. 
after 
awhile 
i 
saw RelNScrEv_bus
that 
my 
destination 
was UnrelEv_bus
near 
and 
should 
get+off ScrEv_get_off
. 
i 
pushed ScrEv_press_stop_button
the 
button 
that 
sent ScrEv_press_stop_button
a 
signal 
requesting ScrEv_press_stop_button
the 
bus 
to 
stop ScrEv_bus_stops
at 
the 
next 
bus 
top 
. 
the 
bus 
pulled+over ScrEv_bus_stops
at 
the 
next 
stop 
and 
i 
got+off ScrEv_get_off
the 
bus 
. 
i 
met UnrelEv_bus
my 
friend 
a 
few 
blocks 
down 
at 
a 
restaurant 
and 
had UnrelEv_bus
a 
great 
time 
. 
<end_of_story>_bus 
i 
had 
to 
ride+a+public+bus Evoking_bus
one 
day 
. 
i 
was UnrelEv_bus
n't 
sure 
about 
the 
routes 
or 
the 
charge 
to 
ride Evoking_bus
, 
so 
i 
got RelNScrEv_bus
on 
the 
computer 
and 
looked ScrEv_check_time-table
it 
up 
. 
i 
was 
able 
to 
enter+in ScrEv_check_time-table
where 
i 
was 
starting RelNScrEv_bus
from 
and 
where 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_bus
to 
be UnrelEv_bus
in 
order 
to 
find ScrEv_check_time-table
an 
acceptable 
route 
. 
i 
had 
to 
catch RelNScrEv_bus
two 
different 
buses 
, 
so 
i 
had 
to 
pay RelNScrEv_bus
a 
transfer 
fee 
in 
addition 
to 
the 
regular 
fee 
and 
let RelNScrEv_bus
the 
bus 
driver 
know RelNScrEv_bus
as 
i 
got+on ScrEv_board_bus
the 
bus 
. 
i 
also 
looked+up ScrEv_check_time-table
a 
route 
home 
with 
extra 
times 
in 
case 
i 
missed RelNScrEv_bus
a 
bus 
. 
i 
gathered RelNScrEv_bus
the 
things 
i 
needed UnrelEv_bus
for 
my 
travels 
and 
found ScrEv_find_bus
a 
sign 
with 
a 
bus 
stop 
symbol 
on 
it 
, 
and 
made+sure ScrEv_find_bus
it 
listed UnrelEv_bus
the 
bus 
number 
i 
needed UnrelEv_bus
. 
i 
told RelNScrEv_bus
the 
driver 
i 
needed UnrelEv_bus
a 
transfer 
ticket 
and 
paid ScrEv_get_ticket
my 
extra 
fee 
. 
when 
it 
was UnrelEv_bus
time 
to 
get+off ScrEv_get_off
the 
bus 
, 
i 
had 
to 
pull ScrEv_press_stop_button
the 
cord 
to 
let ScrEv_press_stop_button
the 
driver 
know ScrEv_press_stop_button
before 
we 
passed RelNScrEv_bus
my 
spot 
. 
<end_of_story>_bus 
this 
morning 
when 
i 
woke+up UnrelEv_bus
for 
work 
i 
realized UnrelEv_bus
i 
was 
running+late RelNScrEv_bus
for 
my 
usual 
ride 
. 
i 
hurried UnrelEv_bus
to 
get+ready RelNScrEv_bus
and 
then 
raced ScrEv_get_bus_stop
to 
the 
bus 
terminal 
that 
is UnrelEv_bus
nearest 
to 
my 
apartment 
. 
i 
arrived ScrEv_get_bus_stop
at 
the 
bus 
stop 
just 
in 
time 
as 
the 
bus 
was 
pulling+up ScrEv_bus_comes
when 
i 
got ScrEv_get_bus_stop
there 
. 
the 
bus 
driver 
opened ScrEv_door_opens
the 
door 
and 
a 
line 
of 
people 
filed ScrEv_board_bus
into 
the 
bus 
ahead 
of 
me 
. 
as 
i 
boarded ScrEv_board_bus
the 
bus 
i 
dropped ScrEv_get_ticket
some 
change 
in 
the 
drivers 
bucket 
to 
pay ScrEv_get_ticket
for 
my 
ride 
to 
work 
. 
i 
quickly 
moved ScrEv_find_place
toward 
the 
back 
of 
the 
bus 
and 
found ScrEv_find_place
an 
open 
seat 
. 
i 
sat ScrEv_spend_time_bus
patiently 
as 
the 
bus 
made ScrEv_bus_stops
a 
few 
more 
stops 
and 
people 
came ScrEv_board_bus
and 
went ScrEv_get_off
from 
the 
bus 
. 
after 
about 
twenty 
minutes 
the 
bus 
pulled+up ScrEv_bus_stops
outside 
my 
office 
building 
. 
the 
bus 
came ScrEv_bus_stops
to 
a 
stop 
and 
i 
hopped+up ScrEv_go_exit
and 
made ScrEv_go_exit
my 
decent 
down 
the 
stairs 
and 
off 
the 
bus 
. 
i 
was UnrelEv_bus
at 
work 
with 
only 
minutes 
to 
spare UnrelEv_bus
before 
i 
needed UnrelEv_bus
to 
be 
punched+in UnrelEv_bus
for 
my 
shift 
. 
i 
was UnrelEv_bus
happy 
i 
had 
made UnrelEv_bus
it 
on 
time 
. 
<end_of_story>_bus 
my 
friend 
and 
i 
took+the+bus Evoking_bus
last 
week 
to 
the 
mall 
. 
this 
was UnrelEv_bus
a 
fun 
trip 
that 
last RelNScrEv_bus
for 
a 
few 
hours 
back 
and 
forth 
. 
in 
the 
morning 
we 
got+up UnrelEv_bus
early 
to 
wait ScrEv_wait
outside 
the 
bus 
stop 
near 
our 
houses 
. 
when 
the 
bus 
came ScrEv_bus_comes
on 
time 
we 
got+on+board ScrEv_board_bus
and 
paid ScrEv_get_ticket
for 
our 
tickets 
through 
the 
machine 
. 
my 
friend 
swiped RelNScrEv_bus
his 
bus 
card 
and 
i 
paid ScrEv_get_ticket
in 
cash 
. 
after 
we 
got+on ScrEv_board_bus
we 
both 
went ScrEv_find_place
to 
the 
back 
where 
there 
were UnrelEv_bus
two 
empty 
seats 
. 
after 
stopping ScrEv_bus_stops
at 
523 
stops 
we 
transferred ScrEv_change_bus
buses 
at 
the 
local 
station 
. 
this 
would 
allow UnrelEv_bus
us 
to 
take RelNScrEv_bus
the 
right 
route 
to 
the 
mall 
. 
after 
coming+back UnrelEv_bus
from 
the 
mall 
we 
took+the+same+bus Evoking_bus
. 
there 
were UnrelEv_bus
a 
lot 
more 
people 
in 
the 
afternoon 
. 
at 
one 
point 
there 
were UnrelEv_bus
no 
seats 
left 
and 
two 
old 
ladies 
got+on+board ScrEv_board_bus
. 
my 
friend 
an 
i 
decided UnrelEv_bus
to 
be UnrelEv_bus
polite 
and 
gave UnrelEv_bus
them 
our 
seats 
while 
we 
stood ScrEv_spend_time_bus
. 
overall 
it 
was UnrelEv_bus
a 
great 
experience 
being 
able 
to 
ride+the+bus Evoking_bus
and 
help UnrelEv_bus
others 
at 
the 
same 
time 
. 
<end_of_story>_bus 
yesterday 
i 
decided UnrelEv_bus
i 
needed 
to 
get RelNScrEv_bus
to 
the 
grocery 
bus 
. 
my 
car 
had UnrelEv_bus
a 
flat 
tire 
, 
so 
i 
decided UnrelEv_bus
to 
ride+the+public+bus Evoking_bus
. 
first 
, 
i 
went+online RelNScrEv_bus
to 
see RelNScrEv_bus
the 
map 
of 
the 
public 
bus 
' 
because 
it 
overwhelms UnrelEv_bus
me 
and 
i 
am+afraid UnrelEv_bus
i 
will 
get+lost UnrelEv_bus
. 
then 
i 
called RelNScrEv_bus
the 
bus 
hotline 
and 
asked RelNScrEv_bus
the 
operator 
how 
to 
get RelNScrEv_bus
where 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_bus
to 
go RelNScrEv_bus
. 
he 
helped UnrelEv_bus
me 
figure+out ScrEv_check_time-table
what 
buses 
i 
need 
to 
take RelNScrEv_bus
where 
. 
then 
, 
i 
had UnrelEv_bus
some 
lunch 
, 
took RelNScrEv_bus
my 
backpack 
and 
left RelNScrEv_bus
the 
house 
. 
i 
had 
to 
walk ScrEv_get_bus_stop
to 
the 
bus 
stop 
. 
on 
the 
way 
, 
i 
could 
smell UnrelEv_bus
the 
exhaust 
from 
the 
cars 
and 
i 
already 
started+freaking+out UnrelEv_bus
. 
the 
exhaust 
is UnrelEv_bus
really 
unhealthy 
for 
you 
. 
then 
i 
waited ScrEv_wait
for 
the 
bus 
at 
the 
stop 
. 
after 
523 
minutes 
, 
the 
bus 
i 
needed UnrelEv_bus
finally 
came ScrEv_bus_comes
. 
the 
bus 
came ScrEv_bus_stops
to 
stop 
, 
the 
doors 
opened ScrEv_door_opens
. 
i 
stepped ScrEv_board_bus
onto 
the 
bus 
and 
gave ScrEv_get_ticket
the 
driver 
my 
money 
. 
<end_of_story>_bus 
the 
other 
day 
, 
i 
decided UnrelEv_bus
to 
ride+the+bus Evoking_bus
to 
work 
since 
my 
car 
had 
broken+down UnrelEv_bus
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_bus
a 
cold 
day 
in 
january 
as 
the 
rain 
had 
just 
fallen UnrelEv_bus
the 
night 
before 
. 
i 
sat ScrEv_spend_time_bus
nearby 
the 
rear-door 
of 
the 
bus 
and 
felt UnrelEv_bus
he 
air-conditioner 
blowing UnrelEv_bus
onto 
my 
neck 
and 
watched ScrEv_spend_time_bus
the 
street 
signs 
to 
see RelNScrEv_bus
how 
much 
further 
my 
stop 
was 
going 
to 
be UnrelEv_bus
. 
i 
had 
been 
riding+on+the+bus Evoking_bus
for 
approximately 
523 
minutes 
and 
stopped ScrEv_bus_stops
three 
times 
so 
far 
. 
we 
came+upon RelNScrEv_bus
a 
busy 
intersection 
where 
the 
bus 
stop 
was UnrelEv_bus
crowded 
with 
what 
appeared UnrelEv_bus
to 
be 
fifteen 
or 
so 
people 
huddled UnrelEv_bus
by 
the 
bench 
area 
waiting ScrEv_wait
to 
get+on ScrEv_board_bus
. 
slowly 
the 
people 
in 
queue 
walked ScrEv_board_bus
onto 
the 
bus 
steps 
and 
piled ScrEv_board_bus
into 
each 
available 
space 
as 
quickly 
as 
they 
could UnrelEv_bus
. 
after 
driving ScrEv_ride
for 
two 
more 
blocks 
, 
i 
noticed RelNScrEv_bus
my 
stop 
and 
pressed ScrEv_press_stop_button
the 
button 
to 
signal ScrEv_press_stop_button
the 
driver 
to 
drop ScrEv_get_off
me 
off 
. 
i 
stood+up ScrEv_go_exit
from 
my 
seat 
and 
headed ScrEv_go_exit
to 
the 
door 
and 
left ScrEv_get_off
to 
go RelNScrEv_bus
to 
work 
. 
<end_of_story>_bus 
last 
weekend 
there 
was UnrelEv_bus
a 
parade 
in 
the 
downtown 
area 
of 
my 
city 
, 
and 
i 
decided UnrelEv_bus
to 
take UnrelEv_bus
my 
little 
sister 
- 
we 
had UnrelEv_bus
so 
much 
fun 
! 
i 
'm UnrelEv_bus
not 
old 
enough 
to 
drive UnrelEv_bus
and 
our 
parents 
were UnrelEv_bus
busy 
, 
so 
i 
decided UnrelEv_bus
to 
take+the+bus Evoking_bus
. 
i 
went+online RelNScrEv_bus
and 
looked ScrEv_find_bus
at 
the 
bus 
route 
to 
determine ScrEv_find_bus
which 
stop 
let ScrEv_get_off
us 
off 
closest 
to 
the 
parade 
, 
and 
then 
i 
looked ScrEv_check_time-table
at 
the 
bus 
schedule 
to 
see ScrEv_check_time-table
what 
time 
the 
bus 
would 
come ScrEv_bus_comes
and 
how 
often 
it 
ran RelNScrEv_bus
. 
i 
also 
found+out RelNScrEv_bus
how 
much 
the 
ride 
costs RelNScrEv_bus
, 
and 
mom 
gave UnrelEv_bus
me 
the 
money 
i 
needed UnrelEv_bus
for 
both 
of 
us 
. 
the 
day 
of 
the 
parade 
my 
sister 
and 
i 
walked ScrEv_get_bus_stop
the 
two 
short 
blocks 
to 
the 
bus 
stop 
and 
waited ScrEv_wait
inside 
the 
little 
bus 
shelter 
. 
when 
the 
bus 
came ScrEv_bus_comes
, 
the 
driver 
came ScrEv_bus_stops
to 
a 
stop 
and 
the 
doors 
opened ScrEv_door_opens
and 
we 
walked+up ScrEv_board_bus
the 
two 
steps 
. 
we 
said RelNScrEv_bus
hello 
to 
the 
driver 
and 
paid ScrEv_get_ticket
the 
fare 
- 
my 
sister 
loved UnrelEv_bus
putting ScrEv_get_ticket
the 
coins 
in 
the 
fare 
box 
. 
we 
walked ScrEv_find_place
a 
few 
steps 
down 
the 
aisle 
and 
took ScrEv_find_place
a 
seat 
near 
the 
front 
of 
the 
bus 
and 
settled+in ScrEv_find_place
to 
look ScrEv_spend_time_bus
out 
of 
the 
window 
. 
the 
bus 
made ScrEv_bus_stops
a 
lot 
of 
stops 
and 
all 
types 
of 
people 
got Unclear_bus
on 
and 
off 
of 
the 
bus 
; 
it 
was UnrelEv_bus
pretty 
noisy 
! 
when 
i 
could 
tell UnrelEv_bus
we 
were 
getting+close RelNScrEv_bus
to 
our 
stop 
, 
i 
pulled ScrEv_press_stop_button
the 
chord 
to 
alert ScrEv_press_stop_button
the 
driver 
that 
we 
were 
getting+off ScrEv_get_off
at 
the 
next 
stop 
. 
when 
we 
reached ScrEv_bus_stops
our 
stop 
, 
my 
sister 
and 
i 
walked ScrEv_go_exit
down 
the 
aisle 
and 
off 
of 
the 
bus 
. 
we 
were UnrelEv_bus
just 
in 
time 
to 
see UnrelEv_bus
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
parade 
! 
<end_of_story>_bus 
i 
went UnrelEv_bus

york 
city 
on 
a 
business 
trip

i 
was UnrelEv_bus
in 
manhattan

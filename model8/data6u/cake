butter 
. 
i 
measured ScrEv_add_ingredients
a 
cup 
of 
sugar 
into 
the 
same 
bowl

i 
used ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
my 
electric 
mixer

beat ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
the 
butter 
and 
sugar 
until 
they 
were UnrelEv_cake

<end_of_story>_cake 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_cake
to 
make+a+chocolate+cake Evoking_cake
for 
my 
niece 
's 
birthday 
, 
so 
i 
looked+through ScrEv_choose_recipe
my 
kitchen 
cupboards 
to 
make RelNScrEv_cake
sure 
i 
had RelNScrEv_cake
all 
the 
ingredients 
. 
luckily 
, 
my 
kitchen 
was UnrelEv_cake
well-stocked RelNScrEv_cake
with 
baking 
goods 
. 
i 
gathered+up ScrEv_get_ingredients
the 
butter 
, 
eggs 
, 
sugar 
, 
flour 
, 
vanilla 
extract 
and 
cocoa 
. 
i 
also 
had RelNScrEv_cake
a 
mixing 
bowl 
with 
a 
built-in 
electric 
whisk 
. 
i 
tossed+in ScrEv_add_ingredients
two 
sticks 
of 
butter 
and 
523 
cups 
of 
sugar 
and 
blended ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
them 
together 
before 
adding ScrEv_add_ingredients
the 
vanilla 
, 
flour 
and 
cocoa 
. 
then 
i 
pulled ScrEv_get_utensils
a 
cake 
pan 
out 
of 
a 
drawer 
and 
greased ScrEv_grease_cake_tin
it 
up 
with 
crisco 
to 
make UnrelEv_cake
sure 
the 
cake 
would 
not 
stick RelNScrEv_cake
. 
i 
used RelNScrEv_cake
a 
spatula 
to 
spread ScrEv_pour_dough
the 
cake 
batter 
evenly 
into 
the 
dish 
and 
then 
, 
just 
to 
make UnrelEv_cake
the 
cake 
even 
tastier 
, 
i 
grabbed ScrEv_get_ingredients
two 
cups 
of 
chocolate 
pudding 
out 
of 
my 
fridge 
and 
swirled ScrEv_add_ingredients
the 
pudding 
into 
the 
cake 
mix 
. 
it 
makes UnrelEv_cake
for 
a 
very 
moist 
and 
tasty 
treat 
! 
i 
placed ScrEv_put_cake_oven
the 
cake 
inside 
the 
oven 
and 
cooked ScrEv_wait
it 
at 
523 
degrees 
for 
523 
minute 
. 
hopefully 
my 
niece 
will 
enjoy RelNScrEv_cake
her 
homemade 
confection 
on 
her 
birthday 
. 
<end_of_story>_cake 
for 
my 
13th 
birthday 
i 
decided UnrelEv_cake
i 
'd 
bake+my+own+cake Evoking_cake
instead 
of 
having UnrelEv_cake
my 
mom 
buy UnrelEv_cake
one 
for 
me 
. 
to 
keep UnrelEv_cake
it 
simple 
my 
mom 
bought ScrEv_get_ingredients
a 
betty 
crocker 
cake 
mix 
. 
once 
my 
friends 
arrived UnrelEv_cake
we 
gathered UnrelEv_cake
in 
the 
kitchen 
to 
make+the+cake Evoking_cake
. 
the 
first 
thing 
we 
did UnrelEv_cake
was 
set ScrEv_preheat
the 
stove 
to 
the 
temperature 
indicated RelNScrEv_cake
on 
the 
box 
. 
while 
the 
stove 
warmed+up ScrEv_preheat
i 
asked UnrelEv_cake
my 
friend 
nikki 
to 
be UnrelEv_cake
in 
charge 
of 
getting ScrEv_get_ingredients
things 
from 
the 
fridge 
while 
my 
friend 
stephanie 
went UnrelEv_cake
to 
the 
cabinets 
to 
get ScrEv_get_utensils
whatever 
i 
called+out UnrelEv_cake
that 
was 
needed Unclear_cake
there 
. 
once 
we 
had Unclear_cake
the 
bowls 
, 
measuring 
cups 
, 
and 
liquid 
ingredients 
from 
the 
fridge 
we 
were UnrelEv_cake
ready 
to 
start UnrelEv_cake
mixing ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
. 
three 
people 
making+a+cake Evoking_cake
is UnrelEv_cake
a 
bit 
difficult 
to 
do UnrelEv_cake
, 
but 
we 
had UnrelEv_cake
fun 
talking UnrelEv_cake
while 
we 
were 
doing UnrelEv_cake
it 
and 
i 
ended+up+doing UnrelEv_cake
most 
of 
it 
while 
my 
friends 
chatted UnrelEv_cake
with 
me 
. 
i 
put ScrEv_add_ingredients
the 
mix 
in 
the 
bowl 
and 
added ScrEv_add_ingredients
the 
fresh 
ingredients 
. 
we 
took UnrelEv_cake
turns 
mixing ScrEv_make_dough
that 
up 
and 
then 
poured ScrEv_pour_dough
the 
mix 
into 
a 
cake 
pan 
that 
nikki 
greased ScrEv_grease_cake_tin
with 
some 
butter 
. 
i 
then 
put ScrEv_put_cake_oven
the 
cake 
into 
the 
stove 
while 
wearing RelNScrEv_cake
oven 
mitts 
and 
set ScrEv_set_time
the 
stove 
's 
timer 
to 
the 
suggested RelNScrEv_cake
baking 
time 
on 
the 
box 
. 
while 
it 
baked ScrEv_wait
we 
could 
n't 
help+spooning+out UnrelEv_cake
some 
icing 
for 
ourselves 
. 
<end_of_story>_cake 
every 
year 
, 
my 
sister 
makes UnrelEv_cake
the 
same 
request 
for 
a 
birthday 
cake 
made Evoking_cake
the 
same 
way 
. 
naturally 
, 
i 
abide UnrelEv_cake
, 
knowing UnrelEv_cake
that 
i 
wo 
n't 
have 
to 
buy UnrelEv_cake
her 
a 
present 
if 
i 
make+her+the+cake Evoking_cake
. 
i 
first 
go ScrEv_get_ingredients
to 
the 
store 
and 
pick+up ScrEv_get_ingredients
some 
ingredients 
i 
do 
n't 
already 
have RelNScrEv_cake
. 
the 
very 
first 
thing 
i 
do+is UnrelEv_cake
take+out ScrEv_get_ingredients
the 
butter 
to 
warm ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
it 
up 
by 
putting RelNScrEv_cake
it 
into 
my 
pocket 
. 
i 
preheat ScrEv_preheat
the 
oven 
. 
i 
then 
measure+out ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
all 
the 
ingredients 
and 
pull+out ScrEv_get_utensils
my 
mixer 
. 
i 
grease ScrEv_grease_cake_tin
the 
cake 
pans 
. 
after 
mixing ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
all 
the 
dry 
and 
wet 
ingredients 
separately 
, 
i 
put ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
them 
together 
until 
it 
is 
well 
mixed ScrEv_make_dough
. 
i 
pour ScrEv_pour_dough
the 
batter 
into 
the 
pan 
and 
put ScrEv_put_cake_oven
it 
in 
the 
oven 
for 
523 
minutes 
. 
while 
it 
is 
cooking ScrEv_wait
, 
i 
make ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
the 
frosting 
and 
decide UnrelEv_cake
to 
add ScrEv_add_ingredients
some 
pink 
food 
coloring 
. 
when 
the 
cake 
is 
finished RelNScrEv_cake
, 
i 
let UnrelEv_cake
it 
cool ScrEv_cool_down
and 
then 
cover ScrEv_decorate
it 
with 
frosting 
. 
i 
put RelNScrEv_cake
it 
in 
the 
fridge 
and 
will 
take UnrelEv_cake
it 
over 
to 
her 
house 
in 
a 
few 
hours 
. 
<end_of_story>_cake 
i 
like UnrelEv_cake
to 
cook UnrelEv_cake
a 
lot 
but 
i 
am UnrelEv_cake
not 
a 
very 
good 
baker 
. 
so 
i 
never 
bake+cakes Evoking_cake
from 
scratch 
. 
however 
i 
do 
like UnrelEv_cake
cake 
al 
ot 
so 
i 
do 
bake Evoking_cake
them 
. 
i 
use RelNScrEv_cake
box 
mixes 
. 
they 
are UnrelEv_cake
easy 
to 
use RelNScrEv_cake
and 
make RelNScrEv_cake
a 
very 
nice 
cake 
. 
it 
really 
does 
n't 
take UnrelEv_cake
much 
time 
. 
all 
you 
need 
to 
do+is UnrelEv_cake
get ScrEv_get_utensils
one 
bowl 
. 
add ScrEv_add_ingredients
the 
cake 
mix 
from 
the 
box 
. 
either 
523 
or 
523 
eggs 
added ScrEv_add_ingredients
to 
the 
bowl 
. 
then 
a 
half 
cup 
of 
oil 
and 
finally 
about 
a 
cup 
of 
water 
. 
then 
you 
need 
to 
get ScrEv_get_utensils
your 
mixer 
and 
put RelNScrEv_cake
it 
on 
medium 
and 
mix ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
it 
all 
up 
for 
523 
to 
523 
minutes 
. 
then 
put ScrEv_pour_dough
it 
into 
a 
non 
stick 
cake 
pan 
and 
bake ScrEv_put_cake_oven
for 
about 
523 
minutes 
. 
so 
all 
together 
about 
523 
minutes 
preparation 
and 
523 
minutes 
baking ScrEv_wait
you 
can 
have UnrelEv_cake
a 
good 
tasting ScrEv_eat
cake 
in 
523 
minutes 
. 
. 
i 
do 
n't 
really 
like UnrelEv_cake
frosting 
so 
as 
soon 
as 
it 
cools ScrEv_cool_down
i 
cut RelNScrEv_cake
myself 
a 
slice 
. 
<end_of_story>_cake 
i 
decided UnrelEv_cake
to 
bake+a+cake Evoking_cake
for 
my 
brother 
's 
birthday 
. 
he 
likes UnrelEv_cake
chocolate 
cake 
the 
best 
so 
i 
chose ScrEv_choose_recipe
a 
box 
of 
double 
fudge 
cake 
for 
him 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_cake
a 
cake 
mix 
in 
a 
box 
because 
that 
's UnrelEv_cake
the 
easiest 
way 
to 
back+a+cake Evoking_cake
. 
the 
back 
of 
the 
box 
said UnrelEv_cake
to 
preheat ScrEv_preheat
the 
oven 
so 
i 
did ScrEv_preheat
and 
then 
i 
took+out Unclear_cake
a 
bowl 
, 
a 
mixer 
, 
milk 
, 
eggs 
and 
oil 
. 
i 
opened ScrEv_get_ingredients
the 
cake 
box 
and 
poured ScrEv_add_ingredients
the 
cake 
mix 
into 
the 
bowl 
. 
then 
i 
added ScrEv_add_ingredients
two 
eggs 
and 
the 
amount 
of 
milk 
and 
oil 
the 
back 
of 
the 
box 
said UnrelEv_cake
to 
use ScrEv_add_ingredients
. 
next 
i 
used UnrelEv_cake
the 
mixer 
to 
stir ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
it 
all 
together 
. 
after 
that 
i 
used UnrelEv_cake
a 
little 
more 
oil 
to 
grease ScrEv_grease_cake_tin
a 
cake 
pan 
. 
the 
back 
of 
the 
box 
also 
told UnrelEv_cake
me 
which 
size 
cake 
pan 
to 
use RelNScrEv_cake
. 
once 
the 
cake 
pan 
was UnrelEv_cake
ready 
, 
i 
poured ScrEv_pour_dough
the 
mixed ScrEv_make_dough
cake 
batter 
into 
it 
and 
smoothed RelNScrEv_cake
it 
into 
the 
edges 
then 
opened RelNScrEv_cake
the 
oven 
to 
put ScrEv_put_cake_oven
it 
inside 
. 
i 
used RelNScrEv_cake
an 
oven 
mitt 
on 
my 
hand 
for 
that 
part 
because 
the 
oven 
was UnrelEv_cake
hot 
. 
once 
the 
door 
was 
closed RelNScrEv_cake
again 
, 
i 
set ScrEv_set_time
a 
timer 
to 
the 
right 
amount 
of 
time 
, 
according 
to 
the 
back 
of 
the 
box 
, 
and 
then 
waited ScrEv_wait
. 
by 
the 
time 
the 
timer 
went+off ScrEv_wait
, 
the 
cake 
smelled RelNScrEv_cake
really 
good 
and 
i 
turned+off ScrEv_turn_off_oven
the 
oven 
, 
then 
opened RelNScrEv_cake
it 
and 
took ScrEv_take_out_oven
the 
cake 
out 
with 
oven 
mitts 
again 
. 
then 
i 
let UnrelEv_cake
it 
cool ScrEv_cool_down
on 
a 
rack 
on 
the 
counter 
. 
when 
it 
was ScrEv_cool_down
cool 
i 
opened ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
a 
container 
of 
fudge 
frosting 
and 
spread ScrEv_decorate
it 
all 
over 
the 
cake 
. 
i 
just 
need 
to 
put ScrEv_decorate
candles 
on 
it 
and 
i 
think UnrelEv_cake
my 
brother 
will 
really 
like UnrelEv_cake
it 
. 
<end_of_story>_cake 
i 
love UnrelEv_cake
to 
eat ScrEv_eat
sweets 
, 
and 
on 
a 
day 
like 
today 
, 
i 
really 
could 
use UnrelEv_cake
a 
piece 
of 
cake 
. 
however 
, 
i 
was UnrelEv_cake
not 
sure 
that 
i 
would 
not 
have RelNScrEv_cake
the 
ingredients 
necessary 
to 
bake+a+cake Evoking_cake
, 
plus 
, 
the 
kids 
are UnrelEv_cake
home 
, 
and 
i 
would 
have 
to 
include UnrelEv_cake
them 
in 
the 
activity 
. 
however 
, 
i 
decided UnrelEv_cake
to 
make UnrelEv_cake
baking+a+cake Evoking_cake
a 
family 
activity 
, 
and 
hope 
we 
could 
have UnrelEv_cake
some 
fun 
doing UnrelEv_cake
so 
. 
i 
quickly 
looked RelNScrEv_cake
in 
the 
cupboards 
, 
and 
realized UnrelEv_cake
that 
i 
had RelNScrEv_cake
enough 
ingredients 
to 
bake+the+cake Evoking_cake
. 
i 
got ScrEv_get_ingredients
the 
mixing 
bowls 
, 
and 
the 
kids 
helped UnrelEv_cake
with 
the 
cracking ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
of 
the 
eggs 
, 
and 
the 
mixing ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
. 
i 
knew UnrelEv_cake
the 
anticipation 
of 
the 
cake 
was UnrelEv_cake
heavy 
on 
their 
minds 
, 
as 
it 
had 
been UnrelEv_cake
a 
while 
since 
i 
baked+a+cake Evoking_cake
. 
once 
the 
mixing ScrEv_make_dough
was 
done UnrelEv_cake
, 
i 
turn ScrEv_preheat
the 
oven 
on 
to 
preheat ScrEv_preheat
, 
and 
moved RelNScrEv_cake
the 
kids 
to 
the 
island 
for 
safety 
. 
they 
took UnrelEv_cake
turns 
pouring ScrEv_pour_dough
the 
cake 
batter 
into 
the 
pan 
, 
and 
then 
i 
placed ScrEv_put_cake_oven
the 
cake 
into 
the 
oven 
. 
the 
hard 
part 
is UnrelEv_cake
now 
waiting ScrEv_wait
, 
and 
i 
hate UnrelEv_cake
to 
wait ScrEv_wait
, 
however 
, 
this 
cake 
was UnrelEv_cake
worth 
waiting ScrEv_wait
for 
. 
as 
a 
treat 
, 
i 
allowed UnrelEv_cake
the 
kids 
to 
eat ScrEv_eat
a 
tiny 
piece 
of 
the 
cake 
, 
as 
a 
thank 
you 
gesture 
for 
all 
their 
help 
. 
<end_of_story>_cake 
this 
morning 
, 
my 
sister 
decided UnrelEv_cake
to 
bake+a+cake Evoking_cake
for 
her 
friend 
who 
was 
visiting UnrelEv_cake
from 
out 
of 
town 
. 
so 
, 
after 
stopping RelNScrEv_cake
by 
the 
grocery 
store 
to 
buy ScrEv_get_ingredients
some 
sugar 
, 
she 
gathered ScrEv_get_ingredients
all 
of 
the 
ingredients 
and 
cooking 
utensils 
, 
she 
needed RelNScrEv_cake
in 
her 
kitchen 
. 
she 
got ScrEv_get_ingredients
butter 
, 
flour 
, 
cocoa 
powder 
, 
salt 
, 
baking 
powder 
, 
eggs 
, 
vanilla 
, 
and 
some 
buttermilk 
. 
next 
, 
she 
preheated ScrEv_preheat
her 
oven 
to 
523 
degrees 
and 
greased ScrEv_grease_cake_tin
her 
round 
baking 
pan 
with 
the 
butter 
. 
she 
then 
mixed ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
all 
of 
the 
wet 
ingredients 
such 
as 
the 
eggs 
, 
vanilla 
, 
and 
buttermilk 
in 
a 
mixing 
bowl 
. 
for 
the 
dry 
ingredients 
like 
the 
flour 
, 
she 
mixed ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
them 
separately 
in 
another 
, 
smaller 
bowl 
, 
where 
they 
were 
stirred ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
together 
. 
once 
this 
was 
done UnrelEv_cake
, 
the 
dry 
mixture 
was 
combined ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
with 
the 
wet 
mixture 
and 
then 
they 
were 
were 
thoroughly 
stirred+together ScrEv_make_dough
. 
my 
sister 
then 
used RelNScrEv_cake
a 
spatula 
to 
make+sure UnrelEv_cake
all 
of 
the 
batter 
poured ScrEv_pour_dough
into 
the 
baking 
pan 
. 
after 
which 
, 
the 
pan 
was 
placed ScrEv_put_cake_oven
in 
the 
over 
for 
half 
an 
hour 
. 
when 
the 
cake 
was RelNScrEv_cake
ready 
, 
she 
took ScrEv_take_out_oven
the 
cake 
and 
set ScrEv_cool_down
it 
on 
her 
kitchen 
counter 
to 
cool+off ScrEv_cool_down
for 
a 
few 
minutes 
. 
finally 
, 
she 
placed RelNScrEv_cake
it 
onto 
a 
plate 
and 
carefully 
put+on ScrEv_decorate
some 
chocolate 
buttercream 
frosting 
. 
the 
cake 
was UnrelEv_cake
now 
ready 
for 
her 
friend 
to 
enjoy ScrEv_eat
once 
she 
arrived UnrelEv_cake
. 
<end_of_story>_cake 
i 
have UnrelEv_cake
a 
recipe 
for 
a 
yellow 
layer 
cake 
that 
i 
really 
like UnrelEv_cake
that 
came UnrelEv_cake
in 
my 
kitchenaid 
cookbook 
. 
i 
use UnrelEv_cake
my 
kitchenaid 
mixer 
to 
make+it Evoking_cake
. 
it 
's UnrelEv_cake
not 
too 
dry 
, 
and 
it 
's UnrelEv_cake
not 
too 
sweet 
, 
which 
is UnrelEv_cake
why 
i 
like UnrelEv_cake
it 
. 
i 
took ScrEv_get_utensils
my 
mixer 
out 
of 
the 
pantry 
and 
set ScrEv_get_utensils
it 
on 
the 
counter 
. 
then 
i 
found ScrEv_get_utensils
the 
right 
beater 
for 
cake 
and 
installed ScrEv_get_utensils
it 
. 
i 
creamed ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
the 
butter 
and 
the 
sugar 
, 
added ScrEv_add_ingredients
the 
eggs 
, 
and 
then 
added ScrEv_add_ingredients
the 
wet 
and 
dry 
ingredients 
alternately 
. 
i 
had 
forgotten UnrelEv_cake
to 
take ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
the 
eggs 
out 
earlier 
to 
let UnrelEv_cake
them 
come ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
to 
room 
temperature 
, 
but 
it 
still 
works UnrelEv_cake
ok 
. 
while 
beating ScrEv_make_dough
the 
cake 
batter 
, 
i 
preheated ScrEv_preheat
the 
oven 
. 
then 
i 
took+out ScrEv_get_utensils
two 
eight-inch 
round 
cake 
pans 
and 
buttered ScrEv_grease_cake_tin
them 
. 
after 
that 
, 
i 
floured ScrEv_grease_cake_tin
the 
cake 
pans 
and 
tipped RelNScrEv_cake
the 
extra 
flour 
into 
the 
garbage 
can 
. 
when 
the 
batter 
was 
ready 
, 
i 
stopped RelNScrEv_cake
the 
mixer 
, 
removed RelNScrEv_cake
the 
bowl 
, 
and 
poured ScrEv_pour_dough
half 
the 
batter 
into 
each 
pan 
. 
i 
just 
eye-balled RelNScrEv_cake
it 
and 
did 
n't 
measure RelNScrEv_cake
exactly 
half 
. 
then 
i 
scraped ScrEv_pour_dough
the 
remaining UnrelEv_cake
batter 
out 
of 
the 
bowl 
and 
into 
the 
pans 
. 
i 
put RelNScrEv_cake
the 
bowl 
in 
the 
sink 
. 
i 
evened+out RelNScrEv_cake
the 
top 
of 
the 
batter 
a 
little 
with 
a 
spatula 
and 
tapped RelNScrEv_cake
the 
cake 
pans 
on 
the 
counter 
to 
make+sure UnrelEv_cake
there 
were UnrelEv_cake
no 
air 
bubbles 
. 
i 
put ScrEv_put_cake_oven
the 
cakes 
in 
the 
oven 
and 
set ScrEv_set_time
the 
timer 
. 
then 
i 
turned+on RelNScrEv_cake
the 
oven 
light 
because 
i 
like UnrelEv_cake
to 
keep RelNScrEv_cake
an 
eye 
on 
the 
cakes 
to 
see UnrelEv_cake
how 
they 
're 
cooking ScrEv_wait
. 
plus 
it 
's UnrelEv_cake
fun 
to 
see UnrelEv_cake
them 
rise RelNScrEv_cake
. 
when 
the 
timer 
went+off ScrEv_wait
, 
i 
stuck ScrEv_check
a 
thin 
knife 
blade 
into 
each 
cake 
to 
test ScrEv_check
whether 
they 
were 
done RelNScrEv_cake
. 
no 
crumbs 
stuck RelNScrEv_cake
to 
the 
knife 
, 
so 
i 
removed ScrEv_take_out_cake_tin
the 
cakes 
from 
the 
pan 
and 
set ScrEv_cool_down
them 
on 
the 
stove 
burners 
to 
cool ScrEv_cool_down
. 
after 
a 
couple 
of 
minutes 
, 
i 
turned RelNScrEv_cake
each 
pan 
upside-down 
onto 
a 
cooling 
rack 
and 
let UnrelEv_cake
the 
cakes 
cool ScrEv_cool_down
for 
about 
an 
hour 
. 
then 
i 
tipped RelNScrEv_cake
one 
cake 
over 
onto 
a 
large 
plate 
. 
i 
made ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
frosting 
and 
spread ScrEv_decorate
some 
on 
this 
layer 
. 
then 
i 
tipped RelNScrEv_cake
the 
other 
layer 
on 
top 
of 
that 
one 
and 
frosted ScrEv_decorate
it 
too 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_cake
vanilla 
frosting 
. 
<end_of_story>_cake 
i

mix 
, 
eggs

my 
cupboard 
and 
a 
large 
wooden 
spoon 
from 
my 
drawer 
. 
i 
preheated ScrEv_preheat
the 
oven

degrees 
. 
i 
poured ScrEv_add_ingredients
the 
cake 
mix 
from 
the 
package 
into 
the 
bowl 
. 
i 
added ScrEv_add_ingredients
two 
eggs 
, 
and 
used UnrelEv_cake
my 
measuring 
cups 
to 
add ScrEv_add_ingredients
oil 
and 
water 
to 
the 
bowl 
. 
i 
mixed ScrEv_make_dough
the 
ingredients 
thoroughly 
until 
they 
were UnrelEv_cake
smooth 
. 
i 
got ScrEv_take_out_cake_tin
my 
baking 
pan 
and 
sprayed ScrEv_grease_cake_tin
it 
with 
cooking 
spray 
. 
i 
poured ScrEv_pour_dough
the 
cake 
batter 
into 
the 
pan 
and 
placed ScrEv_put_cake_oven
it 
into 
the 
oven 
. 
i 
waited ScrEv_wait
523 
minutes 
until 
the 
cake 
was UnrelEv_cake
slightly 
brown 
and 
i 
took ScrEv_take_out_oven
it 
out 
of 
the 
oven 
. 
i 
allowed UnrelEv_cake
it 
to 
sit ScrEv_cool_down
on 
the 
counter 
and 
cool ScrEv_cool_down
until 
i 
could 
put ScrEv_decorate
the 
icing 
on 
. 
i 
got UnrelEv_cake
opened ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
the 
container 
of 
icing 
and 
used UnrelEv_cake
a 
spatula 
to 
spread ScrEv_decorate
it 
on 
the 
cake 
. 
this 
is UnrelEv_cake
how 
i 
baked+a+cake Evoking_cake
. 
<end_of_story>_cake 
last 
christmas 
i 
had 
to 
bake+a+cake Evoking_cake
for 
myself 
, 
and 
it 
was UnrelEv_cake
a 
bit 
of 
a 
doozy 
. 
i 
do 
n't 
know UnrelEv_cake
a 
lot 
about 
making+cakes Evoking_cake
, 
but 
i 
have UnrelEv_cake
a 
super-huge 
baking 
pan 
, 
an 
oven 
, 
and 
a 
big 
sweet 
tooth 
! 
i 
left UnrelEv_cake
the 
house 
looking+around ScrEv_get_ingredients
various 
convenience 
stores 
for 
cake 
mix 
; 
it 
was UnrelEv_cake
christmas 
, 
so 
going UnrelEv_cake
to 
a 
big 
store 
and 
wasting UnrelEv_cake
a 
bunch 
of 
time 
was UnrelEv_cake
out 
of 
the 
question 
. 
i 
had 
to 
spend UnrelEv_cake
a 
whole 
hour 
checking UnrelEv_cake
for 
a 
store 
that 
had UnrelEv_cake
any 
cake 
mix 
left UnrelEv_cake
! 
i 
finally 
settled+on ScrEv_get_ingredients
two 
boxes 
of 
butter 
cake 
mix 
and 
some 
pink 
lemonade 
frosting 
and 
took ScrEv_get_ingredients
it 
all 
home 
. 
since 
my 
pan 
was UnrelEv_cake
way 
too 
big 
for 
just 
one 
box 
, 
i 
had 
to 
follow Unclear_cake
the 
instructions 
and 
double ScrEv_add_ingredients
every 
ingredient 
while 
making ScrEv_make_dough
the 
batter 
and 
pouring ScrEv_pour_dough
it 
in 
. 
i 
preheated ScrEv_preheat
the 
oven 
, 
put ScrEv_put_cake_oven
the 
cake 
pan 
with 
the 
batter 
in 
to 
bake ScrEv_wait
, 
and 
watched UnrelEv_cake
tv 
for 
a 
few 
hours 
while 
i 
waited ScrEv_wait
for 
it 
to 
be 
done ScrEv_wait
. 
i 
checked ScrEv_check
the 
cake 
several 
times 
with 
a 
toothpick 
to 
make+sure UnrelEv_cake
it 
was 
fully 
baked ScrEv_wait
. 
once 
it 
was 
done ScrEv_wait
, 
i 
took ScrEv_take_out_oven
it 
out 
to 
cool ScrEv_cool_down
and 
frosted ScrEv_decorate
it 
, 
and 
then 
cut ScrEv_eat
the 
cake 
into 
several 
square 
pieces 
. 
it 
went UnrelEv_cake
better 
than 
i 
expected UnrelEv_cake
for 
my 
first 
cake 
on 
short 
notice 
, 
but 
the 
frosting 
was UnrelEv_cake
super 
sweet 
! 
<end_of_story>_cake 
on 
saturday 
i 
baked+a+chocolate+cake Evoking_cake
for 
my 
dad 
's

. 
on 
saturday

, 
i 
went ScrEv_get_ingredients
to 
the 
local 
supermarket 
and 
bought ScrEv_get_ingredients
all 
the 
necessary 
ingredients 
. 
when 
i 
arrived+back UnrelEv_cake
home 
, 
i 
laid ScrEv_get_ingredients
all 
the 
ingredients 
out 
on 
the 
kitchen 
counter 
. 
i 
then 
preheated ScrEv_preheat
the 
oven 
to 
523 
degrees 
fahrenheit 
and 
greased ScrEv_grease_cake_tin
a 
cake 
tin 
with 
butter 
. 
then 
, 
following Unclear_cake
the 
directions 
in 
the 
recipe 
i 
found ScrEv_choose_recipe
in 
my 
cookbook 
, 
i 
measured+out ScrEv_add_ingredients
the 
correct 
quantities 
for 
all 
the 
ingredients 
. 
i 
then 
made ScrEv_make_dough
the 
cake 
batter 
following Unclear_cake
the 
step-by-step 
instructions 
in 
the 
recipe 
. 
when 
the 
batter 
was 
made ScrEv_make_dough
, 
i 
poured ScrEv_pour_dough
it 
into 
my 
greased ScrEv_grease_cake_tin
cake 
pan 
. 
i 
then 
placed ScrEv_put_cake_oven
the 
cake 
in 
the 
oven 
and 
set ScrEv_set_time
the 
kitchen 
timer 
to 
523 
minutes 
. 
when 
the 
timer 
rang ScrEv_wait
, 
i 
removed ScrEv_take_out_oven
the 
cake 
from 
the 
oven 
, 
using UnrelEv_cake
kitchen 
mitts 
so 
i 
would 
n't 
burn RelNScrEv_cake
my 
hands 
. 
i 
then 
placed ScrEv_cool_down
the 
pan 
on 
the 
counter 
for 
523 
minutes 
. 
after 
523 
minutes 
had 
passed ScrEv_cool_down
, 
i 
carefully 
removed ScrEv_take_out_cake_tin
the 
cake 
from 
the 
pan 
and 
placed ScrEv_cool_down
it 
on 
a 
wire 
rack 
to 
cool ScrEv_cool_down
. 
when 
the 
cake 
was ScrEv_cool_down
completely 
cool 
, 
i 
iced ScrEv_decorate
it 
with 
chocolate 
frosting 
. 
<end_of_story>_cake 
i 
preheated ScrEv_preheat
the 
oven 
to 
523 
degrees 
. 
as 
i 
waited ScrEv_wait
, 
i 
gathered ScrEv_get_ingredients
my 
ingredients 
: 
butter 
, 
flour 
, 
baking 
powder 
, 
salt 
, 
sugar 
, 
eggs 
, 
and 
heavy 
cream 
. 
i 
mixed ScrEv_make_dough
all 
the 
ingredients 
together 
in 
a 
large 
bowl 
with 
a 
large 
spoon 
, 
following Unclear_cake
a 
recipe 
i 
found ScrEv_choose_recipe
in 
a 
cookbook 
. 
i 
greased ScrEv_grease_cake_tin
a 
cake 
pan 
with 
butter 
and 
flour 
so 
the 
cake 
would 
n't 
stick RelNScrEv_cake
then 
poured ScrEv_pour_dough
the 
batter 
inside 
. 
i 
put ScrEv_put_cake_oven
the 
cake 
pan 
in 
the 
oven 
for 
approximately 
523 
minutes 
. 
i 
watched ScrEv_wait
the 
cake 
closely 
in 
the 
oven 
. 
once 
it 
turned ScrEv_check
lightly 
golden 
grown Unclear_cake
on 
top 
, 
i 
tested ScrEv_check
the 
center 
. 
once 
the 
center 
was RelNScrEv_cake
the 
correct 
firmness 
-- 
not 
too 
hard 
, 
not 
too 
soft 
-- 
i 
removed ScrEv_take_out_oven
the 
cake 
. 
i 
let UnrelEv_cake
the 
cake 
cool ScrEv_cool_down
for 
523 
minutes 
in 
order 
to 
allow UnrelEv_cake
it 
to 
solidify ScrEv_cool_down
. 
i 
used UnrelEv_cake
a 
knife 
around 
it 
's 
edge 
to 
separate ScrEv_take_out_cake_tin
it 
from 
the 
pan 
then 
removed ScrEv_take_out_cake_tin
the 
cake 
onto 
parchment 
paper 
. 
<end_of_story>_cake 
today 
i 
decided UnrelEv_cake
to 
bake+a+cake Evoking_cake
so 
we 
could 
have ScrEv_eat
it 
for 
dessert 
with 
tonight 
's 
dinner 
. 
i 
thought UnrelEv_cake
a 
chocolate 
cake 
would 
be UnrelEv_cake
nice 
, 
so 
i 
took+out RelNScrEv_cake
my 
cookbook 
and 
looked+for ScrEv_choose_recipe
a 
recipe 
for 
chocolate 
cake 
. 
there 
were UnrelEv_cake
a 
few 
different 
chocolate 
cake 
recipes 
, 
but 
i 
picked ScrEv_choose_recipe
one 
that 
was 
called UnrelEv_cake
devil 
's 
food 
cake 
. 
the 
recipe 
had RelNScrEv_cake
a 
list 
of 
ingredients 
, 
so 
i 
checked ScrEv_get_ingredients
my 
cupboard 
to 
make+sure UnrelEv_cake
i 
had UnrelEv_cake
everything 
i 
would 
need UnrelEv_cake
. 
when 
i 
was+sure UnrelEv_cake
i 
did UnrelEv_cake
, 
i 
got+out ScrEv_get_utensils
523 
mixing 
bowls 
and 
a 
cake 
pan 
. 
the 
recipe 
said UnrelEv_cake
to 
preheat ScrEv_preheat
the 
oven 
to 
523 
degrees 
, 
so 
i 
turned ScrEv_preheat
the 
oven 
on 
and 
set ScrEv_preheat
the 
temperature 
for 
523 
. 
then 
i 
took ScrEv_get_ingredients
a 
bit 
of 
butter 
and 
rubbed ScrEv_grease_cake_tin
it 
all 
over 
the 
inside 
of 
the 
cake 
pan 
. 
that 
would 
make+sure UnrelEv_cake
the 
cake 
did 
n't 
stick RelNScrEv_cake
in 
the 
pan 
and 
i 
would 
be 
able 
to 
get ScrEv_take_out_cake_tin
it 
out 
without 
any 
trouble 
. 
i 
got+out ScrEv_get_utensils
my 
electric 
mixer 
and 
put ScrEv_get_utensils
the 
beaters 
in 
, 
then 
plugged ScrEv_get_utensils
the 
mixer 
in 
the 
electrical 
outlet 
. 
as 
i 
read RelNScrEv_cake
the 
directions 
from 
the 
recipe 
, 
i 
put ScrEv_get_ingredients
the 
butter 
and 
sugar 
in 
one 
of 
the 
bowls 
. 
i 
put RelNScrEv_cake
the 
beaters 
in 
the 
bowl 
and 
turned+on RelNScrEv_cake
the 
electric 
mixer 
, 
holding RelNScrEv_cake
it 
really 
tightly 
as 
it 
mixed ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
the 
butter 
and 
sugar 
until 
it 
was UnrelEv_cake
fluffy 
. 
i 
cracked ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
some 
eggs 
, 
and 
added ScrEv_add_ingredients
them 
to 
the 
bowl 
and 
beat ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
that 
some 
more 
. 
in 
another 
bowl 
i 
mixed ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
flour 
, 
baking 
powder 
, 
cocoa 
powder 
and 
all 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
dry 
ingredients 
. 
then 
i 
mixed ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
the 
wet 
ingredients 
with 
the 
dry 
ones 
and 
mixed ScrEv_make_dough
them 
all 
together 
with 
the 
electric 
mixer 
until 
the 
batter 
was UnrelEv_cake
smooth 
. 
when 
it 
was UnrelEv_cake
, 
i 
poured ScrEv_pour_dough
the 
batter 
in 
my 
cake 
pan 
and 
put ScrEv_put_cake_oven
it 
in 
the 
oven 
. 
the 
recipe 
said UnrelEv_cake
it 
would 
take ScrEv_wait
523 
minutes 
to 
cook ScrEv_wait
, 
so 
i 
looked+at ScrEv_set_time
the 
clock 
in 
my 
kitchen 
to 
see UnrelEv_cake
what 
time 
it 
was UnrelEv_cake
. 
then 
i 
added ScrEv_set_time
523 
minutes 
to 
the 
time 
and 
knew UnrelEv_cake
when 
my 
cake 
would 
be Unclear_cake
ready 
. 
when 
523 
minutes 
was+up ScrEv_wait
, 
i 
opened ScrEv_take_out_oven
the 
oven 
and 
looked+at ScrEv_check
the 
cake 
. 
it 
looked ScrEv_check
done ScrEv_wait
, 
but 
to 
be+sure UnrelEv_cake
i 
took ScrEv_check
a 
toothpick 
and 
stuck ScrEv_check
it 
in 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
cake 
. 
if 
it 
came+out ScrEv_check
clean 
, 
i 
'd 
know UnrelEv_cake
the 
cake 
was 
done ScrEv_check
. 
if 
it 
came+out ScrEv_check
full 
of 
wet 
cake 
batter 
, 
it 
was 
not 
done ScrEv_check
yet 
, 
and 
would 
need UnrelEv_cake
a 
bit 
longer 
to 
cook ScrEv_wait
. 
the 
toothpick 
came+out ScrEv_check
clean 
. 
my 
cake 
was 
done ScrEv_check
. 
i 
put+on ScrEv_get_utensils
a 
potholder 
glove 
so 
i 
would 
n't 
get UnrelEv_cake
burned RelNScrEv_cake
and 
removed ScrEv_take_out_oven
the 
cake 
from 
the 
oven 
. 
i 
put ScrEv_cool_down
it 
on 
a 
wire 
rack 
on 
my 
kitchen 
counter 
so 
it 
could 
cool+off ScrEv_cool_down
before 
i 
tried UnrelEv_cake
to 
take ScrEv_take_out_cake_tin
it 
from 
the 
pan 
. 
when 
it 
was ScrEv_cool_down
cool 
, 
i 
flipped ScrEv_take_out_cake_tin
the 
pan 
over 
onto 
the 
rack 
and 
the 
cake 
fell+out ScrEv_take_out_cake_tin
of 
the 
pan 
. 
it 
looked UnrelEv_cake
good 
, 
and 
i 
knew UnrelEv_cake
everyone 
would 
enjoy ScrEv_eat
the 
chocolate 
cake 
that 
night 
at 
dinner 
. 
<end_of_story>_cake 
i 
like UnrelEv_cake
baking+cakes Evoking_cake
with 
my 
granddaughter 
. 
i 
let UnrelEv_cake
her 
help UnrelEv_cake
pour+in ScrEv_add_ingredients
the 
ingredients 
and 
mix ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
them 
together 
. 
i 
take ScrEv_get_ingredients
a 
box 
of 
cake 
mix 
to 
her 
house 
so 
we 
can 
bake+a+cake Evoking_cake
together 
. 
we 
read ScrEv_choose_recipe
the 
directions 
on 
the 
back 
of 
the 
box 
of 
cake 
mix 
. 
then 
we 
get+out ScrEv_get_ingredients
everything 
needed ScrEv_get_ingredients
to 
make+the+cake Evoking_cake
. 
we 
usually 
need ScrEv_get_ingredients
eggs 
, 
cooking 
oil 
, 
and 
water 
or 
milk 
. 
we 
also 
need ScrEv_get_utensils
a 
cake 
pan 
, 
a 
large 
mixing 
bowl 
, 
a 
measuring 
cup 
, 
and 
a 
mixing 
spoon 
. 
also 
it 
helps UnrelEv_cake
to 
make+sure UnrelEv_cake
we 
have ScrEv_get_utensils
pot 
holders 
and 
a 
spatula 
. 
i 
pre-heat ScrEv_preheat
the 
oven 
to 
the 
temperature 
given RelNScrEv_cake
in 
the 
directions 
. 
then 
i 
grease ScrEv_grease_cake_tin
or 
oil ScrEv_grease_cake_tin
the 
cake 
pan 
so 
the 
cake 
does 
not 
stick RelNScrEv_cake
to 
the 
pan 
. 
usually 
the 
directions 
want UnrelEv_cake
me 
to 
add ScrEv_add_ingredients
a 
little 
flour 
to 
the 
pan 
to 
coat ScrEv_grease_cake_tin
the 
oil 
, 
but 
i 
like 
to 
use ScrEv_grease_cake_tin
sugar 
instead 
because 
it 
does 
not 
leave RelNScrEv_cake
the 
outside 
of 
the 
cake 
looking UnrelEv_cake
like 
flour 
. 
we 
start UnrelEv_cake
by 
carefully 
cracking ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
the 
egg 
shell 
and 
pouring ScrEv_add_ingredients
the 
egg 
into 
a 
small 
cup 
or 
bowl 
to 
make+sure ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
we 
do 
not 
have RelNScrEv_cake
a 
bad 
egg 
. 
then 
we 
pour ScrEv_add_ingredients
it 
into 
the 
mixing 
bowl 
. 
if 
we 
need Unclear_cake
more 
than 
one 
egg 
, 
we 
do ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
each 
one 
separately 
the 
same 
way 
. 
then 
we 
measure+out ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
the 
amount 
of 
oil 
needed RelNScrEv_cake
and 
pour ScrEv_add_ingredients
it 
into 
the 
mixing 
bowl 
, 
too 
. 
then 
my 
granddaughter 
mixes+up ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
the 
eggs 
and 
oil 
really 
well 
. 
next 
, 
i 
measure+out ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
the 
amount 
of 
liquid 
-lrb- 
water 
or 
milk 
-rrb- 
called+for RelNScrEv_cake
in 
the 
directions 
. 
she 
adds ScrEv_add_ingredients
the 
liquid 
to 
the 
egg 
and 
oil 
mixture 
and 
stirs ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
it 
all 
up 
really 
well 
. 
then 
we 
add ScrEv_add_ingredients
the 
cake 
mix 
, 
a 
little 
at 
a 
time 
, 
stirring ScrEv_make_dough
well 
to 
mix ScrEv_make_dough
. 
then 
i 
pour ScrEv_pour_dough
the 
cake 
batter 
into 
the 
baking 
pan 
and 
spread RelNScrEv_cake
it 
evenly 
with 
a 
spatula 
. 
next 
, 
i 
carefully 
put ScrEv_put_cake_oven
the 
cake 
pan 
into 
the 
oven 
and 
set ScrEv_set_time
a 
timer 
to 
check ScrEv_check
it 
to 
see UnrelEv_cake
if 
it 
is 
done ScrEv_wait
. 
we 
check ScrEv_check
to 
see UnrelEv_cake
if 
it 
is 
done ScrEv_wait
by 
putting ScrEv_check
a 
clean 
toothpick 
into 
the 
center 
of 
the 
cake 
. 
if 
it 
comes+out ScrEv_check
with 
little 
or 
none 
of 
the 
cake 
batter 
stuck RelNScrEv_cake
to 
the 
toothpick 
, 
it 
is 
done ScrEv_wait
and 
ready 
to 
take+out ScrEv_take_out_oven
of 
the 
oven 
, 
using RelNScrEv_cake
pot 
holders 
. 
if 
there 
is RelNScrEv_cake
still 
gooey 
stuff 
on 
the 
toothpick 
, 
the 
cake 
needs 
to 
be 
baked ScrEv_wait
a 
little 
longer 
and 
then 
tested ScrEv_check
again 
. 
we 
are UnrelEv_cake
eager 
to 
see ScrEv_check
how 
our 
cake 
turns+out Unclear_cake
. 
we 
play UnrelEv_cake
games 
while 
we 
wait ScrEv_wait
for 
it 
to 
cool ScrEv_cool_down
. 
then 
we 
taste ScrEv_eat
a 
little 
piece 
before 
we 
put ScrEv_decorate
frosting 
on 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
cake 
. 
<end_of_story>_cake 
a 
friend 
of 
mine 
had UnrelEv_cake
a 
birthday 
coming+up UnrelEv_cake
, 
so 
i 
decided UnrelEv_cake
to 
bake+her+a+cake Evoking_cake
. 
i 
knew UnrelEv_cake
that 
she 
loved UnrelEv_cake
vanilla 
cake 
with 
chocolate 
icing 
, 
so 
that 
is UnrelEv_cake
what 
i 
decided ScrEv_choose_recipe
to 
make Evoking_cake
. 
i 
had UnrelEv_cake
a 
cookbook 
that 
has UnrelEv_cake
a 
nice 
and 
easy 
recipe 
for 
vanilla 
cake 
. 
i 
got+out RelNScrEv_cake
the 
cookbook 
and 
read RelNScrEv_cake
the 
ingredients 
list 
. 
i 
decided UnrelEv_cake
to 
take+out ScrEv_get_ingredients
all 
the 
ingredients 
at 
once 
to 
make UnrelEv_cake
it 
easier 
and 
make+sure UnrelEv_cake
i 
had ScrEv_get_ingredients
everything 
i 
needed Unclear_cake
. 
when 
i 
had ScrEv_get_ingredients
everything 
i 
needed Unclear_cake
, 
i 
took+out ScrEv_get_utensils
the 
bowls 
and 
pan 
and 
began UnrelEv_cake
to 
mix ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
the 
ingredients 
. 
i 
did UnrelEv_cake
it 
just 
as 
the 
recipe 
stated RelNScrEv_cake
, 
so 
i 
would 
n't 
miss RelNScrEv_cake
anything 
and 
make UnrelEv_cake
the 
cake 
taste ScrEv_eat
funny 
. 
when 
the 
cake 
batter 
was ScrEv_make_dough
complete 
, 
i 
poured ScrEv_pour_dough
it 
into 
a 
pan 
and 
put ScrEv_put_cake_oven
it 
in 
the 
oven 
that 
was ScrEv_preheat
already 
hot 
. 
i 
set ScrEv_set_time
the 
timer 
on 
the 
oven 
. 
while 
the 
cake 
was 
baking ScrEv_wait
, 
i 
read ScrEv_choose_recipe
the 
recipe 
for 
the 
chocolate 
icing 
. 
i 
got ScrEv_get_ingredients
all 
those 
ingredients 
out 
and 
proceeded UnrelEv_cake
to 
make ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
the 
icing 
. 
it 
came+out RelNScrEv_cake
great 
and 
was 
very 
chocolaty 
tasting ScrEv_eat
. 
now 
the 
cake 
was 
done ScrEv_wait
so 
i 
took ScrEv_take_out_oven
it 
out 
to 
cool+off ScrEv_cool_down
. 
it 
looked ScrEv_check
very 
nice 
. 
when 
it 
had 
cooled+off ScrEv_cool_down
, 
i 
proceeded UnrelEv_cake
to 
frost ScrEv_decorate
the 
cake 
with 
the 
icing 
i 
had 
made ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_cake
hard 
at 
first 
, 
but 
i 
got UnrelEv_cake
the 
hang 
of 
it 
and 
was UnrelEv_cake
able 
to 
smooth+out ScrEv_decorate
any 
lumps 
i 
made UnrelEv_cake
very 
easily 
. 
i 
put ScrEv_decorate
some 
candles 
on 
the 
cake 
to 
finish UnrelEv_cake
it 
. 
when 
i 
gave RelNScrEv_cake
it 
to 
my 
friend 
, 
she 
was UnrelEv_cake
so 
excited 
. 
we 
lit RelNScrEv_cake
her 
candles 
and 
she 
blew RelNScrEv_cake
them 
out 
. 
we 
all 
had ScrEv_eat
a 
slice 
of 
cake 
and 
everyone 
agreed UnrelEv_cake
that 
this 
was UnrelEv_cake
the 
best 
tasting ScrEv_eat
cake 
they 
had 
ever 
had ScrEv_eat
. 
i 
was UnrelEv_cake
very 
proud 
that 
i 
made+such+a+great+cake Evoking_cake
. 
<end_of_story>_cake 
it 
was UnrelEv_cake
my 
son 
's 
birthday 
so 
i 
decided UnrelEv_cake
to 
bake+him+a+birthday+cake Evoking_cake
. 
i 
went RelNScrEv_cake
to 
the 
store 
and 
bought ScrEv_get_ingredients
chocolate 
cake 
mix 
, 
oil 
, 
eggs 
, 
and 
frosting 
. 
then 
i 
set+about UnrelEv_cake
making+the+cake Evoking_cake
. 
i 
turned+on ScrEv_preheat
the 
oven 
to 
preheat ScrEv_preheat
it 
. 
then 
i 
grabbed ScrEv_get_utensils
a 
big 
bowl 
to 
mix ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
everything 
in 
. 
i 
put ScrEv_add_ingredients
in 
the 
cake 
mix 
, 
the 
oil 
and 
eggs 
. 
then 
i 
found ScrEv_get_utensils
the 
electric 
beaters 
and 
beat ScrEv_make_dough
the 
concoction 
until 
it 
was UnrelEv_cake
smooth 
. 
then 
i 
grabbed ScrEv_get_utensils
the 
pan 
that 
the 
cake 
would 
be 
baked ScrEv_wait
in 
and 
greased ScrEv_grease_cake_tin
the 
sides 
of 
it 
. 
then 
i 
poured ScrEv_pour_dough
the 
cake 
batter 
into 
the 
pan 
. 
then 
i 
put ScrEv_put_cake_oven
the 
pan 
into 
the 
oven 
that 
had 
been 
preheated ScrEv_preheat
. 
i 
set ScrEv_set_time
a 
timer 
to 
thirty 
minutes 
. 
when 
the 
timer 
went+off ScrEv_wait
i 
stuck ScrEv_check
a 
knife 
into 
the 
cake 
to 
see UnrelEv_cake
if 
it 
was 
done+cooking ScrEv_wait
and 
it 
was UnrelEv_cake
. 
<end_of_story>_cake 
i 
decided UnrelEv_cake
to 
try UnrelEv_cake
baking+a+cake Evoking_cake
for 
the 
first 
time 
. 
even 
though 
i 
was UnrelEv_cake
n't 
too 
sure 
about 
how 
to 
do UnrelEv_cake
it 
, 
i 
figured UnrelEv_cake
i 
would 
have UnrelEv_cake
fun 
trying UnrelEv_cake
. 
i 
looked+up ScrEv_choose_recipe
the 
recipe 
online 
and 
went RelNScrEv_cake
to 
the 
store 
to 
buy ScrEv_get_ingredients
all 
the 
ingredients 
. 
i 
set ScrEv_get_ingredients
everything 
on 
the 
kitchen 
counter 
and 
went UnrelEv_cake
to 
work 
. 
i 
first 
opened ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
all 
the 
packages 
of 
the 
ingredients 
. 
i 
then 
followed RelNScrEv_cake
the 
recipe 
in 
full 
detail 
to 
make+sure UnrelEv_cake
i 
did RelNScrEv_cake
it 
correctly 
. 
as 
soon 
as 
i 
had 
everything 
properly 
mixed ScrEv_make_dough
, 
i 
pre-heated ScrEv_preheat
the 
oven 
and 
made+sure UnrelEv_cake
it 
was ScrEv_preheat
at 
the 
right 
temperature 
. 
when 
the 
timer 
indicated ScrEv_preheat
the 
oven 
was+ready ScrEv_preheat
, 
i 
put ScrEv_put_cake_oven
the 
cake 
tray 
with 
the 
mixed ScrEv_make_dough
cake 
batter 
inside 
. 
i 
waited ScrEv_wait
for 
forty 
minutes 
until 
it 
was+ready ScrEv_wait
. 
i 
took+out ScrEv_take_out_oven
the 
cake 
and 
put ScrEv_decorate
chocolate 
frosting 
on 
top 
. 
the 
cake 
came+out UnrelEv_cake
pretty 
well 
for 
my 
first 
time 
baking Evoking_cake
. 
<end_of_story>_cake 
for 
christmas 
last 
year 
, 
my 
family 
had UnrelEv_cake
a 
very 
big 
get 
together 
and 
everyone 
was 
tasked UnrelEv_cake
with 
making UnrelEv_cake
and\/or 
bringing UnrelEv_cake
a 
food 
item 
. 
i 
did 
n't 
know UnrelEv_cake
what 
to 
bring UnrelEv_cake
, 
so 
i 
simply 
asked UnrelEv_cake
my 
aunt 
what 
she 
would 
like UnrelEv_cake
. 
she 
told UnrelEv_cake
me 
that 
she 
would 
love UnrelEv_cake
a 
cake 
, 
as 
there 
was UnrelEv_cake
a 
shortage 
of 
people 
bringing UnrelEv_cake
dessert 
. 
i 
figured UnrelEv_cake
that 
i 
should 
bake+it+myself Evoking_cake
since 
i 
do 
not 
bake Evoking_cake
fairly 
often 
. 
i 
looked+throughout ScrEv_get_ingredients
my 
pantry 
and 
realized UnrelEv_cake
i 
had ScrEv_get_ingredients
everything 
i 
needed RelNScrEv_cake
. 
i 
went+ahead UnrelEv_cake
and 
made+it Evoking_cake
the 
evening 
before 
using Unclear_cake
all 
of 
the 
ingredients 
. 
i 
mixed ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
the 
flour 
, 
sugar 
, 
water 
, 
eggs 
and 
even 
made ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
my 
own 
frosting 
and 
did 
n't 
use RelNScrEv_cake
one 
from 
a 
can 
. 
it 
turned+out RelNScrEv_cake
very 
moist 
, 
sweet 
and 
very 
good 
tasting ScrEv_eat
. 
the 
next 
day 
i 
brought RelNScrEv_cake

<end_of_story>_cake 
i 
decided UnrelEv_cake
to 
bake+a+cake Evoking_cake
for 
my 
daughter 
's 
birthday 
last 
week 
. 
first 
i 
gathered ScrEv_get_ingredients
the 
ingredients 
i 
needed ScrEv_get_ingredients
- 
eggs 
, 
flour 
, 
sugar 
, 
oil 
, 
butter 
, 
and

! 
i 
put ScrEv_get_ingredients
it 
all 
out 
on 
the 
counter 
and 
then 
got ScrEv_get_ingredients
my 
supplies 
. 
i 
needed ScrEv_get_utensils
measuring 
cups 
, 
bowls 
, 
a 
wooden 
spoon 
, 
and 
some 
cake 
pans 
. 
i 
measured+out ScrEv_add_ingredients
the 
dry 
ingredients 
i 
needed ScrEv_get_ingredients
and 
then 
mixed ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
it 
up 
, 
then 
mixed+in ScrEv_add_ingredients
the 
wet 
ingredients 
. 
i 
put ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
it 
all 
in 
my 
kitchen 
aid 
mixer 
and 
mixed ScrEv_make_dough
it 
for 
a 
while 
. 
my 
daughter 
likes UnrelEv_cake
purple 
and 
green 
, 
so 
i 
split ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
the 
batter 
into 
half 
and 
dyed ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
some 
of 
the 
batter 
purple 
and 
some 
teal 
, 
using ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
gel 
food 
coloring 
. 
i 
poured ScrEv_pour_dough
the 
batter 
in 
cake 
pans 
coated ScrEv_grease_cake_tin
in 
cooking 
spray 
and 
baked ScrEv_put_cake_oven
them 
. 
then 
, 
i 
let UnrelEv_cake
them 
cool ScrEv_cool_down
. 
once 
they 
were UnrelEv_cake
ready 
to 
be 
decorated ScrEv_decorate
, 
i 
simply 
used ScrEv_decorate
some 
cream 
cheese 
frosting 
from 
a 
can 
. 
then 
i 
stuck ScrEv_decorate
some 
candles 
in 
it 
and 
wrote ScrEv_decorate
,

<end_of_story>_cake 
i 
decided UnrelEv_cake
to 
bake+a+cake Evoking_cake
for 
my 
friend 
's 
birthday 
. 
i 
went RelNScrEv_cake
to 
the 
store 
and 
purchased ScrEv_get_ingredients
all 
the 
necessary 
ingredients 
. 
when 
i 
got RelNScrEv_cake
home 
, 
i 
turned+on ScrEv_preheat
the 
oven 
to 
let 
it 
preheat ScrEv_preheat
. 
i 
opened ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
the 
box 
of 
cake 
mix 
and 
poured ScrEv_add_ingredients
it 
into 
a 
bowl 
. 
following RelNScrEv_cake
the 
instructions 
, 
i 
mixed+in ScrEv_add_ingredients
oil 
, 
eggs 
, 
and 
water 
until 
it 
was 
blended ScrEv_make_dough
well 
. 
i 
poured ScrEv_pour_dough
the 
batter 
into 
a 
cake 
pan 
and 
put ScrEv_put_cake_oven
it 
into 
the 
oven 
to 
bake ScrEv_wait
. 
while 
the 
cake 
was 
baking ScrEv_wait
, 
i 
prepared ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
the 
frosting 
by 
mixing ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
powdered 
sugar 
, 
butter 
, 
milk 
and 
vanilla 
. 
i 
also 
added ScrEv_add_ingredients
some 
blue 
food 
dye 
to 
make RelNScrEv_cake
the 
cake 
blue 
. 
when 
the 
cake 
was 
finished UnrelEv_cake
baking ScrEv_wait
and 
cooling+off ScrEv_cool_down
, 
i 
iced ScrEv_decorate
the 
cake 
with 
the 
frosting 
. 
when 
it 
was 
covered ScrEv_decorate
, 
i 
took ScrEv_decorate
some 
sprinkles 
and 
wrote ScrEv_decorate
'' 
`` 
happy 
birthday 
joshua 
'' 
'' 
across 
the 
top 
. 
i 
added ScrEv_decorate
some 
candies 
around 
the 
edges 
and 
finished UnrelEv_cake
by 
putting ScrEv_decorate
the 
birthday 
candles 
on 
the 
cake 
. 
i 
brought RelNScrEv_cake
the 
cake 
to 
his 
birthday 
party 
and 
everybody 
loved ScrEv_eat
it 
. 
<end_of_story>_cake 
baking+a+cake Evoking_cake
and 
be UnrelEv_cake
fun 
and 
eating ScrEv_eat
the 
cake 
even 
more 
fun 
. 
i 
have 
made+cakes+homemade Evoking_cake
from 
scratch 
using ScrEv_choose_recipe
a 
recipe 
from 
my 
mom 
. 
but 
most 
of 
the 
cakes 
i 
have 
made RelNScrEv_cake
have 
been UnrelEv_cake
from 
a 
box 
mix 
. 
i 
recently 
made+myself+a+birthday+cake Evoking_cake
. 
i 
made+a+german+chocolate+cake Evoking_cake
and 
it 
was RelNScrEv_cake
delicious 
. 
most 
box 
mixed 
call+for ScrEv_add_ingredients
a 
couple 
eggs 
and 
water 
. 
sometimes 
you 
have 
to 
add ScrEv_add_ingredients
oil 
also 
. 
the 
german 
chocolate 
cake 
i 
made RelNScrEv_cake
called+for ScrEv_add_ingredients
oil 
and 
i 
used ScrEv_add_ingredients
coconut 
oil 
. 
when 
you 
bake+a+cake Evoking_cake
you 
always 
have 
to 
oil ScrEv_grease_cake_tin
and 
flour ScrEv_grease_cake_tin
the 
cake 
pan 
so 
it 
does 
not 
stick RelNScrEv_cake
. 
i 
used ScrEv_get_utensils
two 
round 
cake 
pans 
for 
my 
birthday 
cake 
but 
i 
have 
often 
used ScrEv_get_utensils
a 
square 
pan 
or 
a 
bunt 
pan 
. 
after 
taking ScrEv_take_out_oven
a 
cake 
out 
of 
the 
oven 
you 
need 
to 
let UnrelEv_cake
it 
cool ScrEv_cool_down
. 
i 
was UnrelEv_cake
eager 
for 
my 
birthday 
cake 
to 
cool ScrEv_cool_down
so 
i 
could 
frost ScrEv_decorate
it 
. 
german 
chocolate 
cake 
typically 
has UnrelEv_cake
a 
coconut 
and 
pecan 
frosting 
and 
this 
is UnrelEv_cake
what 
i 
used ScrEv_decorate
. 
<end_of_story>_cake 
the 
other 
day 
i 
decided UnrelEv_cake
to 
bake+a+cake Evoking_cake
so 
i 
got+out ScrEv_get_ingredients
some 
flour 
, 
eggs 
, 
sugar 
, 
and 
frosting 
. 
once 
i 
mixed ScrEv_make_dough
all 
of 
the 
ingredients 
together 
i 
put ScrEv_pour_dough
them 
in 
a 
pan 
and 
into 
an 
oven 
and 
set ScrEv_preheat
the 
oven 
to 
523 
degrees 
. 
i 
put ScrEv_put_cake_oven
the 
cake 
into 
the 
oven 
and 
set ScrEv_set_time
the 
cooking 
alarm 
for 
523 
minutes 
. 
once 
the 
cake 
was 
fully 
cooked ScrEv_wait
and 
the 
cooking 
alarm 
rang ScrEv_wait
i 
took ScrEv_take_out_oven
the 
cake 
out 
of 
the 
oven 
and 
let UnrelEv_cake
it 
cool+off ScrEv_cool_down
for 
a 
couple 
of 
minutes 
. 
after 
those 
couple 
of 
minutes 
were+up UnrelEv_cake
i 
took ScrEv_get_ingredients
some 
frosting 
after 
taking ScrEv_take_out_cake_tin
the 
cake 
out 
of 
the 
cooking 
pan 
and 
onto 
a 
plate 
, 
which 
just 
happened UnrelEv_cake
to 
be UnrelEv_cake
chocolate 
, 
and 
spread ScrEv_decorate
it 
over 
the 
cake 
lightly 
with 
a 
butter 
knife 
. 
once 
i 
had 
completely 
covered ScrEv_decorate
the 
cake 
in 
frosting 
i 
put RelNScrEv_cake
it 
gently 
into 
a 
box 
and 
put RelNScrEv_cake
it 
into 
the 
fridge 
until 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_cake
to 
eat ScrEv_eat
it 
. 
once 
i 
ate ScrEv_eat
it 
tasted ScrEv_eat
really 
very 
good 
.

thanks 
<end_of_story>_cake 
i 
had 
to 
bake+a+cake Evoking_cake
for 
a 
birthday 
party 
. 
i 
took+out ScrEv_get_ingredients
the 
ingredients 
and 
put ScrEv_get_ingredients
them 
on 
the 
counter 
: 
flour 
, 
sugar 
, 
eggs 
, 
vanilla 
, 
salt 
, 
baking 
soda 
, 
and 
milk 
. 
i 
then 
turned+on ScrEv_preheat
the 
oven 
, 
setting ScrEv_preheat
it 
at 
523 
degrees 
. 
while 
it 
was 
preheating ScrEv_preheat
, 
i 
got UnrelEv_cake
to 
work 
. 
i 
mixed ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
the 
wet 
ingredients 
together 
in 
a 
big 
bowl 
, 
and 
then 
slowly 
started UnrelEv_cake
adding ScrEv_add_ingredients
the 
dry 
ingredients 
. 
i 
used ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
a 
blender 
to 
stir ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
the 
ingredients 
together 
. 
when 
they 
were 
all 
mixed ScrEv_make_dough
together 
, 
the 
batter 
was+ready ScrEv_make_dough
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_cake
the 
consistence 
of 
thick 
maple 
syrup 
. 
i 
sprayed ScrEv_grease_cake_tin
spray 
oil 
on 
the 
inside 
of 
a 
pan 
and 
then 
poured ScrEv_pour_dough
the 
cake 
batter 
into 
the 
pan 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_cake
ready 
to 
go ScrEv_put_cake_oven
. 
when 
the 
oven 
beeped RelNScrEv_cake
to 
let UnrelEv_cake
me 
know UnrelEv_cake
that 
it 
was 
finished UnrelEv_cake
preheating ScrEv_preheat
, 
i 
put ScrEv_put_cake_oven
the 
pan 
into 
the 
oven 
. 
i 
put+on ScrEv_set_time
a 
timer 
for 
523 
minutes 
. 
when 
the 
timer 
went+off ScrEv_wait
, 
i 
opened ScrEv_take_out_oven
the 
oven 
door 
and 
took ScrEv_take_out_oven
the 
pan 
out 
. 
i 
inserted ScrEv_check
a 
toothpick 
into 
the 
center 
of 
the 
cake 
and 
took ScrEv_check
it 
out 
to 
see ScrEv_check
if 
the 
cake 
was 
done ScrEv_wait
: 
the 
toothpick 
came+out ScrEv_check
without 
any 
batter 
attached RelNScrEv_cake
to 
it 
, 
so 
the 
cake 
was UnrelEv_cake
good 
to 
go ScrEv_take_out_oven
. 
i 
turned+off ScrEv_turn_off_oven
the 
oven 
and 
left ScrEv_cool_down
the

after 
a

i 
moved ScrEv_take_out_cake_tin
the 
cake 
to 
a 
cooling 
rack 
. 
when 
it 
was ScrEv_cool_down
completely 
cool 
i 
covered ScrEv_decorate
it 
with 
chocolate 
frosting 
and 
wrote ScrEv_decorate

<end_of_story>_cake 
it 
was UnrelEv_cake
my 
girlfriend 
's 
birthday 
so 
i 
baked+her+a+cake Evoking_cake
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_cake
nothing 
fancy 
, 
just 
a 
cake 
from 
a 
box 
. 
i 
mixed ScrEv_make_dough
all 
the 
ingredients 
together 
after 
i 
preheated ScrEv_preheat
the 
oven 
to 
the 
appropriate 
temperature 
. 
after 
mixing ScrEv_make_dough
the 
ingredients 
i 
poured ScrEv_pour_dough
them 
into 
a 
baking 
pan 
. 
then 
i 
put ScrEv_put_cake_oven
the 
pan 
in 
the 
oven 
. 
while 
i 
waited ScrEv_wait
for 
the 
cake 
to 
cook ScrEv_wait
i 
made ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
an 
icing 
to 
go ScrEv_decorate
on 
top 
. 
i 
made ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
it 
from 
cream 
cheese 
and 
strawberries 
which 
i 
whipped+together ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
with 
sugar 
. 
once 
the 
cake 
was 
done UnrelEv_cake
baking ScrEv_wait
i 
pulled ScrEv_take_out_oven
it 
from 
the 
oven 
and 
set ScrEv_cool_down
it 
aside 
to 
cool ScrEv_cool_down
. 
after 
it 
was 
cool ScrEv_cool_down
i 
frosted ScrEv_decorate
it 
with 
my 
homemade 
icing 
. 
then 
i 
piped ScrEv_decorate
her 
name 
on 
top 
in 
fancy 
lettering 
. 
once 
that 
was 
done ScrEv_decorate
i 
placed ScrEv_decorate
it 
on 
a 
fancy 
cake 
tray 
and 
waited UnrelEv_cake
for 
her 
to 
arrive UnrelEv_cake
home 
so 
we 
could 
eat ScrEv_eat
the 
cake 
together 
. 
<end_of_story>_cake 
the 
simplest 
way 
to 
make+cake Evoking_cake
is UnrelEv_cake
with 
a 
mix 
. 
just 
open ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
the 
box 
and 
mix+in ScrEv_add_ingredients
some 
eggs 
, 
some 
water 
, 
and 
maybe 
some 
oil 
. 
grease ScrEv_grease_cake_tin
two 
round 
pans 
by 
rubbing ScrEv_grease_cake_tin
them 
with 
a 
stick 
of 
butter 
, 
pour+in ScrEv_pour_dough
the 
batter 
, 
bake ScrEv_wait
as 
directed RelNScrEv_cake
and 
you 
are 
done UnrelEv_cake
. 
making+a+coffee+cake Evoking_cake
with 
bisquick 
baking 
mix 
is UnrelEv_cake
only 
slightly 
harder 
, 
but 
the 
product 
is UnrelEv_cake
not 
really 
what 
some 
people 
call UnrelEv_cake
a 
cake 
. 
there 
are UnrelEv_cake
also 
delicious 
cakes 
that 
are UnrelEv_cake
really 
store-bought ScrEv_get_ingredients
baked ScrEv_wait
goods 
layered ScrEv_decorate
with 
ice 
cream 
. 
but 
for 
a 
birthday 
, 
an 
actual 
homemade RelNScrEv_cake
cake 
is UnrelEv_cake
traditional 
. 
i 
make+such+a+cake Evoking_cake
in 
two 
separate 
bowls 
and 
then 
combine ScrEv_add_ingredients
the 
mixtures 
. 
i 
also 
use ScrEv_get_utensils
a 
stand 
mixer 
, 
though 
even 
that 
can 
feel UnrelEv_cake
like 
cheating UnrelEv_cake
. 
first 
, 
i 
lay+out ScrEv_get_ingredients
all 
my 
ingredients 
, 
and 
preheat ScrEv_preheat
the 
oven 
. 
i 
prepare ScrEv_grease_cake_tin
two 
round 
pans 
, 
by 
greasing ScrEv_grease_cake_tin
with 
butter 
or 
pan 
spray 
, 
sprinkling ScrEv_grease_cake_tin
with 
flour 
and 
shaking+out ScrEv_grease_cake_tin
the 
excess 
. 
next 
, 
i 
cream ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
the 
butter 
and 
sugar 
together 
, 
on 
a 
medium-high 
mixer 
setting 
. 
then 
i 
mix+in ScrEv_add_ingredients
eggs 
and 
then 
vanilla 
. 
in 
a 
separate 
bowl 
, 
i 
combine ScrEv_add_ingredients
the 
flour 
, 
baking 
powder 
, 
and 
salt 
. 
now 
, 
i 
add ScrEv_add_ingredients
the 
dry 
ingredients 
to 
the 
butter 
mixture 
, 
a 
little 
at 
a 
time 
, 
alternating ScrEv_add_ingredients
with 
the 
milk 
, 
while 
i 
mix ScrEv_make_dough
at 
medium 
high 
. 
it 
is UnrelEv_cake
important 
not 
to 
over 
mix ScrEv_make_dough
, 
so 
i 
only 
combine ScrEv_make_dough
until 
the 
lumps 
are 
gone UnrelEv_cake
and 
it 
looks UnrelEv_cake
glossy 
. 
i 
fill ScrEv_pour_dough
the 
pans 
evenly 
, 
and 
place ScrEv_put_cake_oven
in 
the 
oven 
so 
they 
do 
not 
touch UnrelEv_cake
and 
one 
is UnrelEv_cake
not 
directly 
above 
the 
other 
. 
when 
the 
time 
is+up ScrEv_wait
, 
or 
they 
smell RelNScrEv_cake
done ScrEv_wait
, 
i 
press ScrEv_check
lightly 
in 
the 
center 
of 
the 
cake 
with 
one 
finger 
. 
if 
it 
springs+back ScrEv_check
it 
is 
done ScrEv_wait
. 
i 
cool ScrEv_cool_down
on 
a 
wire 
rack 
, 
run ScrEv_take_out_cake_tin
a 
knife 
around 
the 
edge 
, 
invert ScrEv_take_out_cake_tin
it 
on 
a 
plate 
to 
remove ScrEv_take_out_cake_tin
while 
still 
warm 
. 
i 
frost ScrEv_decorate
liberally 
, 
and 
i 
do 
n't 
forget ScrEv_decorate
the 
candles 
.

sill 
to 
cool ScrEv_cool_down

<end_of_story>_cake 
this 
weekend 
i 
decided UnrelEv_cake
to 
do UnrelEv_cake
something 
special 
with 
my 
son 
. 
he 
been 
asking UnrelEv_cake
me 
to 
bake+a+cake Evoking_cake
with 
him 
so 
i 
figured UnrelEv_cake
today 
would 
be UnrelEv_cake
a 
good 
day 
to 
do UnrelEv_cake
so 
. 
we 
went RelNScrEv_cake
to 
the 
store 
and 
bought ScrEv_get_ingredients
all 
the 
ingredients 
we 
needed ScrEv_get_ingredients
. 
we 
bought ScrEv_get_ingredients
eggs 
, 
milk 
, 
cake 
mix 
, 
and 
even 
frosting 
. 
when 
we 
got+back RelNScrEv_cake
home 
i 
took+out ScrEv_get_utensils
my 
measuring 
cup 
and 
showed RelNScrEv_cake
him 
how 
to 
measure ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
how 
much 
milk 
we 
needed ScrEv_get_ingredients
to 
add ScrEv_add_ingredients
to 
the 
cake 
mix 
. 
then 
we 
both 
proceeded UnrelEv_cake
to 
crack ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
a 
couple 
eggs 
and 
add ScrEv_add_ingredients
it 
to 
the 
mix 
as 
well 
. 
i 
gave ScrEv_get_utensils
him 
the 
hand 
mixer 
and 
he 
started UnrelEv_cake
mixing ScrEv_make_dough
it 
all 
together 
in 
a 
large 
bowl 
. 
i 
could 
tell UnrelEv_cake
he 
was 
having UnrelEv_cake
a 
great 
time 
. 
after 
he 
finished UnrelEv_cake
mixing ScrEv_make_dough
the 
the 
cake 
batter 
, 
i 
slowly 
poured ScrEv_pour_dough
it 
into 
a 
cake 
pan 
. 
i 
pre-heated ScrEv_preheat
the 
oven 
to 
523 
degrees 
and 
when 
it 
was UnrelEv_cake
hot 
enough 
i 
put ScrEv_put_cake_oven
the 
cake 
in 
. 
after 
523 
minutes 
of 
baking ScrEv_wait
the 
cake 
was ScrEv_wait
finally 
ready

523 
minutes 
then 
my 
son 
and 
i 
added ScrEv_decorate
the

it 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_cake

all 
the 
wet 
ingredients

i 
start

no

for 
a

. 
beating ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
this 
on 
medium 
to 
the 
sound 
of 
fallout 
boy 
, 
i 
did UnrelEv_cake
this 
until 
it 
was 
well 
mixed ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
. 
i 
then 
alternately 
combined ScrEv_prepare_ingredients

i 
could 
n't

, 
" 
fun 
, 
this 
has 
been UnrelEv_cake
my 
favorite 
so 
far 
! 
<end_of_story>_cake 
i 
love UnrelEv_cake
to 
make+cheesecake Evoking_cake
for 
my 
family 
. 
we 
have UnrelEv_cake
a 
family 
recipe 
that 
i 
follow UnrelEv_cake
when 
i 
cook Evoking_cake
. 
first 
i 
purchase ScrEv_get_ingredients
the 
ingredients 
at 
the 
store 
and 
make+certain RelNScrEv_cake
i 
have 
everything 
i 
need UnrelEv_cake
. 
then 
i 
make UnrelEv_cake
a 
crust 
from 
scratch 
in 
a 
cake 
pan 
, 
using UnrelEv_cake
crumbled 
cookies 
, 
nuts 
, 
brown 
sugar 
and 
vanilla 
flavor 
. 
i 
turn+on ScrEv_preheat
the 
oven 
to 
pre-heat ScrEv_preheat
, 
as 
my 
oven 
is 
very 
slow 
to 
heat+up ScrEv_preheat
. 
i 
use UnrelEv_cake
my 
electric 
mixer 
to 
whip ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
the 
pats 
of 
cream 
cheese 
, 
making+sure UnrelEv_cake
they 
are 
light 
and 
fluffy 
. 
then 
i 
add ScrEv_add_ingredients
in 
eggs 
, 
sugar 
, 
lemon 
juice 
and 
lemon 
zest 
until 
it 
is 
thoroughly 
combined ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
into 
a 
thick 
liquid 
. 
i 
pour ScrEv_pour_dough
the 
mixture 
into 
the 
prepared ScrEv_grease_cake_tin
cake 
pan 
and 
put ScrEv_put_cake_oven
it 
into 
the 
preheated ScrEv_preheat
oven 
for 
about 
523 
minutes 
. 
when 
the 
cake 
is UnrelEv_cake
slightly 
brown 
on 
top 
, 
i 
remove ScrEv_take_out_oven
it 
from 
the 
oven 
and 
place RelNScrEv_cake
it 
in 
the 
refrigerator 
to 
cool ScrEv_cool_down
. 
this 
usually 
takes ScrEv_wait
about 
two 
hours 
. 
then 
it 
is UnrelEv_cake
ready 
to 
serve ScrEv_eat
. 
<end_of_story>_cake 
so 
while 
most 
people 
will 
talk+about UnrelEv_cake
baking+a+basic+cake Evoking_cake
out 
of 
a 
box 
, 
i 
am 
actually 
going 
to 
be 
writing UnrelEv_cake
about 
re-learning UnrelEv_cake
how 
to 
bake+one+from+scratch Evoking_cake
. 
i 
just 
found+out UnrelEv_cake
that 
i 
have UnrelEv_cake
a 
gluten 
intolerance 
. 
like 
, 
very 
gluten 
intolerant 
. 
so 
, 
i 
am 
re-learning UnrelEv_cake
how 
to 
do UnrelEv_cake
just 
about 
everything 
. 
most 
of 
the 
time 
, 
you 
can 
just 
buy ScrEv_get_ingredients
stuff 
from 
a 
box 
and 
add ScrEv_add_ingredients
some 
eggs 
, 
oil 
and 
milk 
and 
call UnrelEv_cake
it 
good 
. 
well 
, 
as 
there 
are UnrelEv_cake
very 
few 
gluten 
free 
baking 
premade 
box 
mixes 
, 
and 
even 
fewer 
that 
actually 
taste UnrelEv_cake
good 
, 
i 
have 
been 
teaching UnrelEv_cake
myself 
how 
to 
bake+from+scratch Evoking_cake
. 
all 
i 
really 
have 
to 
do UnrelEv_cake
is 
mix ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
and 
match ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
different 
flours 
. 
wheat 
flour 
is UnrelEv_cake
sticky 
and 
fluffy 
, 
but 
keeps UnrelEv_cake
moisture 
well 
. 
that 
is UnrelEv_cake
part 
of 
the 
reason 
so 
many 
bake Evoking_cake
with 
it 
. 
if 
i 
just 
use UnrelEv_cake
rice 
flour 
, 
that 
is 
top 
dry 
. 
if 
i 
just 
use UnrelEv_cake
coconut 
flour 
, 
well 
then 
it 
all 
crumbles UnrelEv_cake
. 
so 
, 
what 
i 
do UnrelEv_cake
is 
buy ScrEv_get_ingredients
several 
different 
kinds 
of 
flours 
so 
i 
can 
mix ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
and 
match ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
their 
properties 
and 
actually 
make 
tasty 
things 
that 
are UnrelEv_cake
extremely 
similar 
to 
the 
real 
deal 
. 
after 
i 
get 
the 
flours 
combined ScrEv_add_ingredients
, 
i 
just 
add ScrEv_add_ingredients
the 
regular 
ingredients 
, 
figure+out UnrelEv_cake
a 
baking 
temperature 
and 
stick ScrEv_put_cake_oven
it 
in 
. 
right 
now 
i 
keep UnrelEv_cake
a 
close 
eye 
on 
the 
food 
since 
there 
are UnrelEv_cake
n't 
a 
ton 
of 
good 
recipes

so

well 
! 
<end_of_story>_cake 
i 
grabbed ScrEv_get_utensils
a 
recipe 
book 
. 
i 
looked+up ScrEv_choose_recipe
a 
cake 
that 
i 
thought UnrelEv_cake
my 
wife 
might 
like 
. 
i 
thought UnrelEv_cake
a 
devil 
's 
food 
cake 
would 
be UnrelEv_cake
perfect 
. 
i 
started UnrelEv_cake
by 
preheating ScrEv_preheat
the 
oven 
to 
523 
degrees 
. 
i 
got+down ScrEv_get_ingredients
the 
dry 
ingredients 
- 
flour 
, 
sugar 
, 
baking 
powder 
, 
cocoa 
powder 
- 
measured+out ScrEv_other_cake
the 
quantities 
the 
recipe 
said UnrelEv_cake
and 
put ScrEv_add_ingredients
them 
in 
a 
bowl 
. 
then 
i 
got ScrEv_get_ingredients
the 
wet 
ingredients 
- 
eggs 
, 
oil 
, 
milk 
- 
and 
mixed ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
those 
up 
in 
a 
separate 
bowl 
. 
then 
i 
combined ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
the 
two 
bowls 
together 
and 
mixed ScrEv_make_dough
them 
thoroughly 
. 
i 
poured ScrEv_pour_dough
the 
contents 
into 
two 
pans 
and 
then 
put ScrEv_put_cake_oven
them 
in 
the 
oven 
. 
about 
a 
half 
hour 
later 
i 
took ScrEv_take_out_oven
the 
two 
pans 
out 
of 
the 
oven 
and 
let UnrelEv_cake
them 
cool ScrEv_cool_down
. 
when 
they 
were UnrelEv_cake
cool 
enough 
, 
i 
took ScrEv_get_ingredients
a 
can 
on 
frosting 
out 
of 
the 
cupboard 
and 
iced ScrEv_decorate
the 
two 
layers 
, 
stacking ScrEv_decorate
on 
on 
the 
other 
. 
i 
thought UnrelEv_cake
it 
looked UnrelEv_cake
pretty 
good 
. 
happy 
birthday 
, 
honey

<end_of_story>_cake 
baking+a+cake Evoking_cake
either 
for 
myself 
or 
for 
friends 
is UnrelEv_cake
a 
fun 
activity 
. 
i 
first 
plan ScrEv_other_cake
ahead 
, 
so 
i 
know UnrelEv_cake
what 
kind 
of 
cake 
i 
will 
be 
making Evoking_cake
and 
what 
supplies 
i 
will 
need UnrelEv_cake
for 
that 
cake 
. 
i 
prepare ScrEv_grease_cake_tin
my 
pans 
, 
so 
the 
cake 
wo 
n't 
stick UnrelEv_cake
to 
the 
sides 
or 
bottom 
and 
preheat ScrEv_preheat
my 
oven 
so 
that 
when 
my 
batter 
is 
mixed ScrEv_make_dough
it 
can 
go ScrEv_put_cake_oven
right 
into 
the 
oven 
. 
a 
simple 
cake 
will 
usually 
require UnrelEv_cake
eggs 
, 
flower 
, 
baking 
powder 
and 
a 
few 
other 
things 
. 
generally 
speaking UnrelEv_cake
i 
will 
mix ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
the 
wet 
ingredients 
in 
one 
bowl 
and 
the 
dry 
in 
another 
before 
mixing ScrEv_make_dough
them 
together 
. 
i 
like 
to 
use UnrelEv_cake
an 
industrial 
strength 
mixing 
bowl 
, 
as 
opposed UnrelEv_cake
to 
a 
hand 
mixer 
. 
i 
make+sure RelNScrEv_cake
that 
it 
is 
well 
mixed ScrEv_make_dough
with 
no 
lumps 
, 
but 
not 
overly 
mixed ScrEv_make_dough
, 
as 
that 
can 
ruin+the UnrelEv_cake
batter 
. 
once 
the 
batter 
is UnrelEv_cake
smooth 
and 
yummy 
i 
pour ScrEv_pour_dough
it 
into 
the 
prepared ScrEv_grease_cake_tin
pans 
and 
pop ScrEv_put_cake_oven
them 
in 
the 
over 
for 
about 
20-30 
minutes 
. 
while 
the 
actually 
baking ScrEv_wait
takes UnrelEv_cake
place 
, 
i 
can 
prepare RelNScrEv_cake
the 
frosting 
. 
<end_of_story>_cake 
my 
girlfriend 
's 
birthday 
was 
coming+up UnrelEv_cake
and 
instead 
of 
my 
usual 
buying UnrelEv_cake
a 
cake 
from 
the 
grocery 
store 
every 
year 
, 
i 
thought UnrelEv_cake
i 
would 
unleash UnrelEv_cake
my 
inner 
paula 
dean 
and 
bake+her+a+cake Evoking_cake
. 
i 
went ScrEv_get_ingredients
to 
the 
store 
and 
bought ScrEv_get_ingredients
an 
easy 
yellow 
cake 
mix 
, 
some 
eggs 
, 
butter 
and 
icing 
. 
i 
decided UnrelEv_cake
to 
do 
it 
this 
way 
because 
when 
it 
comes UnrelEv_cake
to 
me 
and 
cooking Evoking_cake
i 
am UnrelEv_cake
not 
the 
best 
so 
easy 
was UnrelEv_cake
the 
way 
to 
go 
. 
i 
went RelNScrEv_cake
home 
and 
got+out ScrEv_get_utensils
a 
mixing 
bowl 
and 
added ScrEv_add_ingredients
the 
cake 
box 
mix 
, 
two 
eggs 
, 
a 
stick 
of 
butter 
and 
a 
cup 
of 
water 
. 
i 
mixed ScrEv_make_dough
it 
up 
and 
then 
poured ScrEv_pour_dough
the 
batter 
into 
a 
large 
baking 
pan 
and 
licked UnrelEv_cake
the 
beaters 
. 
i 
baked ScrEv_wait
it 
at 
523 
for 
523 
minutes 
and 
it 
came+out ScrEv_take_out_oven
a 
perfect 
golden 
brown 
. 
after 
letting 
it 
cool ScrEv_cool_down
for 
a 
bit 
i 
put+on ScrEv_decorate
the 
chocolate 
icing 
that 
i 
bought ScrEv_get_ingredients
and 
needless 
to 
say 
the 
cake 
was UnrelEv_cake
a 
huge 
hit 
and 
she 
was UnrelEv_cake
very 
impressed 
with 
my 
baking 
skills 
. 
<end_of_story>_cake 
i 
like UnrelEv_cake
to 
help 
mom 
bake+cakes Evoking_cake
. 
it 
's 
something 
we 
enjoy UnrelEv_cake
doing 
together 
. 
mom 
decided UnrelEv_cake
she 
was 
going 
to 
make+a+chocolate+cake Evoking_cake
, 
and 
chocolate 
is UnrelEv_cake
my 
favorite 
! 
first 
, 
we 
washed RelNScrEv_cake
our 
hands 
carefully 
with 
plenty 
of 
soap 
. 
then 
we 
dried RelNScrEv_cake
our 
hands 
. 
the 
first 
thing 
we 
had 
to 
do UnrelEv_cake
was 
sift RelNScrEv_cake
the 
dry 
ingredients 
. 
mom 
got+out ScrEv_get_utensils
a 
really 
big 
mixing 
bowl 
made 
of 
aluminum 
. 
we 
put+in ScrEv_add_ingredients
the 
flour 
, 
sugar 
, 
salt 
, 
and 
baking 
powder 
. 
mom 
likes UnrelEv_cake
turbinado 
sugar 
the 
best 
because 
it 
's UnrelEv_cake
more 
healthy 
, 
so 
we 
used UnrelEv_cake
that 
. 
the 
four 
was UnrelEv_cake
king 
arthur 
cake 
flour 
. 
we 
blended ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
the 
dry 
ingredients 
carefully 
with 
a 
whip 
. 
then 
we 
got ScrEv_get_utensils
another 
bowl 
and 
mixed ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
the 
eggs 
, 
milk 
, 
and 
butter 
. 
mom 
took ScrEv_get_utensils
a 
little 
pan 
and 
melted ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
the 
chocolate 
on 
the 
stove 
on 
very 
low 
heat 
. 
we 
mixed ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
the 
chocolate 
with 
the 
liquids 
and 
then 
poured ScrEv_make_dough
it 
all 
into 
the 
big 
bowl 
. 
we 
baked ScrEv_wait
the 
cake 
for 
523 
minutes 
-- 
it 
seemed UnrelEv_cake
like 
a 
long 
time 
! 
-- 
and 
after 
it 
cooled ScrEv_cool_down
we 
iced ScrEv_decorate
it 
and 
ate ScrEv_eat
some 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_cake
delicious 
.

spray

<end_of_story>_cake 
i 
decided UnrelEv_cake

so 
i 
hopped UnrelEv_cake
into 
the 
car

i 
bought ScrEv_get_ingredients

home 
i 
got+out ScrEv_get_utensils
my 
big 
mixing 
bowl 
and 
measuring 
cups 
and 
spoons 
. 
i 
pre-heated ScrEv_preheat
the 
oven 
to 
523 
degrees 
and 
started 
pouring ScrEv_add_ingredients
ingredients 
into 
the 
mixing 
bowl 
. 
after 
all 
the 
ingredients 
were 
mixed ScrEv_make_dough
, 
i 
greased ScrEv_grease_cake_tin
a 
cake 
pan 
and 
poured ScrEv_pour_dough
in 
the 
batter 
. 
i 
put ScrEv_put_cake_oven
the

oven 
and 
started UnrelEv_cake
mixing ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
the 
ingredients 
for 
the 
frosting 
in 
a 
new 
bowl 
. 
after 
baking ScrEv_wait

while 
, 
i 
took ScrEv_take_out_oven

and 
stuck+in ScrEv_check
a 
toothpick 
to 
make+sure ScrEv_check
the 
center 
was 
done 
. 
i 
let UnrelEv_cake

<end_of_story>_cake 
in 
the 
early 
evening 
, 
my 
friend 
has UnrelEv_cake
a 
birthday 
party 
that 
he 
has 
invited UnrelEv_cake
me 
too 
. 
he 
knows UnrelEv_cake
that 
i 
am UnrelEv_cake
a 
good 
baker 
, 
and 
has 
asked UnrelEv_cake
me 
to 
bake+a+cake Evoking_cake
for 
him 
. 
i 
obliged UnrelEv_cake
, 
being UnrelEv_cake
very 
excited 
to 
make UnrelEv_cake
something 
for 
my 
friend 
. 
i 
went+out ScrEv_get_ingredients
to 
the 
gorcery 
store 
to 
pick+up ScrEv_get_ingredients
a 
few 
last 
ingredients 
that 
i 
would 
need UnrelEv_cake
, 
and 
after 
arriving RelNScrEv_cake
home 
, 
set+out ScrEv_get_utensils
all 
my 
tools 
necessary 
to 
complete UnrelEv_cake
the 
task 
. 
there 
was UnrelEv_cake
a 
good 
chance 
that 
some 
people 
would 
n't 
like UnrelEv_cake
the 
cake 
, 
but 
usually 
it 
's UnrelEv_cake
a 
great 
hit 
whenever 
i 
bake+something Evoking_cake
. 
after 
reviewing RelNScrEv_cake
the 
recipe 
and 
getting ScrEv_put_cake_oven
the 
cake 
in 
the 
oven 
at 
the 
correct 
temperature 
, 
i 
decided+taking UnrelEv_cake
a 
quick 
break 
would 
be UnrelEv_cake
a 
good 
idea 
. 
i 
heated UnrelEv_cake
leftovers 
from 
the 
night 
before 
, 
and 
had UnrelEv_cake
that 
for 
lunch 
while 
waiting ScrEv_wait
for 
my 
now 
baked ScrEv_wait
cakes 
to 
cool ScrEv_cool_down
. 
after 
that 
, 
building ScrEv_decorate
the 
cake 
was UnrelEv_cake

! 
it 
turned+out UnrelEv_cake
to 
my 
standards

<end_of_story>_cake

i 
wanted UnrelEv_cake

i 
decided UnrelEv_cake
to 
bake+a+cake Evoking_cake
from 
scratch 
. 
i 
preheated ScrEv_preheat
my 
oven 
so 
it 
was UnrelEv_cake
nice 
and 
warm 
by 
the 
time 
i 
was 
done UnrelEv_cake
preparing ScrEv_make_dough
the 
cake 
batter 
. 
then

all 
the 
necessary 
ingredients 
for 
baking+a+cake Evoking_cake
. 
there 
are UnrelEv_cake

so 
i 
wo 
n't 
get+into UnrelEv_cake

detail 
about 
what 
went+into UnrelEv_cake
it 
. 
after 
gathering ScrEv_get_ingredients
all 
the 
cake 
ingredients 
, 
now 
it 
was UnrelEv_cake
time 
to 
mix ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
them 
together 
. 
i 
got ScrEv_get_utensils
the 
largest 
bowl 
in 
my 
house 
and 
put ScrEv_add_ingredients
all 
of 
the 
dry 
ingredients 
in 
it 
. 
then 
, 
in 
a 
separate 
bowl 
, 
i 
mixed ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
together 
all 
of 
the 
wet 
ingredients 
. 
then 
i 
combined ScrEv_add_ingredients
the 
wet 
and 
dry 
ingredients 
into 
the 
large 
bowl 
, 
and 
began 
to 
beat ScrEv_make_dough
them 
until 
it 
was 
well 
blended ScrEv_make_dough
. 
i 
poured ScrEv_pour_dough
the 
cake 
batter 
into 
a 
cake 
pan 
and 
put ScrEv_put_cake_oven
the 
cake 
in 
the 
oven 
for 
523 
minutes 
. 
when 
it 
was 
done 
, 
i 
took ScrEv_take_out_oven
it 
out 
the 
oven 
and 
let UnrelEv_cake
it 
cool+off ScrEv_cool_down
. 
we 
had ScrEv_eat
the 
cake 
after 
dinner 
and 
it 
was UnrelEv_cake
a 
huge 
success 
! 
<end_of_story>_cake

butter 
. 
i 
also 
bought ScrEv_get_ingredients
some 
candles 
to 
put ScrEv_decorate
on 
top 
of 
the 
cake 
once 
it 
was 
done 
. 
then 
i 
went RelNScrEv_cake
home 
and 
headed RelNScrEv_cake
for 
the 
kitchen 
. 
i 
preheated ScrEv_preheat
the 
oven 
so 
it 
would 
be UnrelEv_cake
hot 
and 
ready 
for 
the 
cake 
and 
then 
got+out ScrEv_get_utensils
my 
bowls 
and 
measuring 
cups 
and 
spoons 
. 
i 
mixed ScrEv_make_dough
all 
the 
ingredients 
in 
a 
bowl 
then 
got+out ScrEv_get_utensils
a 
cake 
pan 
and 
greased ScrEv_grease_cake_tin
it 
with 
butter 
so 
the 
cake 
would 
not 
stick UnrelEv_cake
, 
poured ScrEv_pour_dough
the 
cake 
batter 
in 
the 
pan 
and 
put ScrEv_put_cake_oven
the 
pan 
in 
the 
oven 
to 
bake ScrEv_wait
. 
i 
set ScrEv_set_time
the 
timer 
on 
the 
oven 
so 
it 
would 
beep RelNScrEv_cake
when 
the 
cake 
was 
done 
, 
then 
cleaned RelNScrEv_cake
up 
the 
bowls 
and 
spoons 
i 
had 
used UnrelEv_cake
. 
when 
the 
cake 
was 
done 
i 
took ScrEv_take_out_oven
it 
out 
of 
the 
oven 
and 
let UnrelEv_cake
it 
cool ScrEv_cool_down
then 
decorated ScrEv_decorate
it 
with 
frosting 
and 
candles 
. 
when 
i 
saw UnrelEv_cake
my 
friend

that 
day 
, 
i 
lit UnrelEv_cake
the 
candles 
and 
sang UnrelEv_cake

, 
something 
simple 
and 
yet 
elegant 
. 
when 
i 
got RelNScrEv_cake

i 
preheated ScrEv_preheat
the 
oven 
to 
523 
degrees 
f 
and 
i 
grease+up ScrEv_grease_cake_tin
my 
pans 
, 
i 
was 
going 
to 
be 
working UnrelEv_cake
hard 
tonight 
. 
i 
then 
melted ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
1\/2 
cup 
of 
butter 
and 
523 
ounce 
of 
chocolate 
in 
a 
small 
pan 
, 
once 
it 
had 
melted ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
i 
set 
it 
aside 
to 
cool+down ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
. 
so 
far 
so 
good 
. 
next 
i 
mixed ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
523 
eggs 
with 
523 
cups 
of 
white 
sugar 
and 
i 
added ScrEv_add_ingredients

after 
that 
i 
added ScrEv_add_ingredients
523 
cup 
of 
boiled 
water

i 
made 
sure 
to 
blend ScrEv_prepare_ingredients

well

very 
liquid 
like 
, 
just 
like 
it 
needed 
to 
be UnrelEv_cake
. 
after 
that 
i 
mixed ScrEv_prepare_ingredients

<end_of_story>_cake 
i 
was 
watching ScrEv_choose_recipe
a 
cooking 
show 
yesterday 
on 
television 
about 
different 
recipes 
for 
cake 
mix 
cakes 
. 
i 
saw ScrEv_choose_recipe
a 
recipe 
that 
looked 
good 
. 
i 
had UnrelEv_cake
a 
red 
velvet 
chocolate 
cake 
mix 
in 
a 
box 
and 
the 
blueberries 
required UnrelEv_cake
. 
i 
'm UnrelEv_cake
too 
adventurous 
for 
my 
own 
good 
. 
i 
figured UnrelEv_cake
i 
'd 
try UnrelEv_cake
it 
. 
i 
tossed ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
the 
blueberries 
with 
sugar 
and 
put ScrEv_add_ingredients
them 
in 
the 
baking 
dish 
. 
i 
then 
mixed ScrEv_make_dough
butter 
and 
a 
little 
milk 
with 
the 
cake 
mix 
. 
i 
put ScrEv_pour_dough
it 
on 
top 
of 
the 
blueberries 
. 
i 
put ScrEv_put_cake_oven
it 
in 
the 
oven 
. 
it 
was 
supposed UnrelEv_cake
to 
be UnrelEv_cake
like 
a 
cobbler 
. 
the 
cake 
was UnrelEv_cake
pretty 
bad 
. 
the 
bottom 
was UnrelEv_cake
all 
watery 
and 
the 
cake 
mix 
was UnrelEv_cake
super 
mushy 
because 
of 
all 
the 
liquid 
. 
the 
first 
couple 
of 
bites 
were UnrelEv_cake
okay 
. 
that 
was UnrelEv_cake
about 
all 
anyone 
could 
eat ScrEv_eat
. 
i 
even 
tried UnrelEv_cake
to 
get UnrelEv_cake
the 
juice 
out 
. 
i 
'm 
tossing UnrelEv_cake
it 
this 
morning 
. 
<end_of_story>_cake 
i 
was 
living UnrelEv_cake
in 
austin 
texas 
and 
decided UnrelEv_cake
i 
was 
going 
to 
try UnrelEv_cake
my 
luck 
at 
making+a+cake Evoking_cake
. 
i 
researched ScrEv_choose_recipe
a 
few 
to 
try 
out 
. 
the 
first 
one 
that 
i 
made Evoking_cake
was 
a 
layered 
italian 
cake 
with 
white 
frosting 
and 
coconut 
flakes 
. 
this 
one 
took UnrelEv_cake
a 
lot 
of 
effort 
due 
to 
the 
multiple 
layers 
, 
but 
the 
taste 
ended+up UnrelEv_cake
being 
excellent 
. 
i 
thought UnrelEv_cake
i 
would 
try UnrelEv_cake
my 
luck 
next 
with 
a 
chocolate 
ganash 
frosting 
on 
top 
of 
a 
peanut 
butter 
cake 
. 
this 
cake 
came+out ScrEv_other_cake
better 
tasting ScrEv_eat
in 
my 
opinion 
and 
the 
in 
the 
opinion 
of 
others 
. 
for 
the 
peanut 
butter 
portion 
of 
it 
, 
it 
had UnrelEv_cake
peanut 
butter 
mixed ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
with 
actual 
butter 
baked ScrEv_other_cake
on 
top 
of 
a 
graham 
cracker 
compressed UnrelEv_cake
crust 
. 
the 
ganash 
was 
made UnrelEv_cake
from 
melting ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
chocolate 
in 
heavy 
whipping 
cream 
briefly 
in 
the 
microwave 
and 
spreading ScrEv_decorate
over 
. 
once 
cooled ScrEv_cool_down
it 
made UnrelEv_cake
kind 
of 
a 
shell 
on 
top 
of 
the 
peanut 
butter 
. 
<end_of_story>_cake 
yesterday 
, 
i 
decided UnrelEv_cake
to 
bake+a+cake Evoking_cake
for 
my 
friend 
's 
birthday 
. 
first 
, 
i 
preheated ScrEv_preheat
my 
oven 
to 
523 
degrees 
. 
i 
then 
took ScrEv_get_utensils
a 
square 
cake 
pan 
out 
of 
my 
cabinet 
and 
rubbed ScrEv_grease_cake_tin
butter 
all 
over 
the 
pan 
. 
i 
sprinkled ScrEv_grease_cake_tin
flour 
in 
the 
pan 
so 
that 
the 
cake 
would 
not 
stick UnrelEv_cake
to 
it 
. 
i 
then 
took ScrEv_get_ingredients
a 
chocolate 
cake 
mix 
that 
i 
purchased ScrEv_get_ingredients
yesterday 
at 
the 
grocery 
store 
out 
of 
my 
food 
pantry 
. 
i 
opened RelNScrEv_cake
the 
cake 
mix 
and 
poured ScrEv_add_ingredients
it 
into 
a 
large 
bowl 
. 
i 
measured RelNScrEv_cake
one 
cup 
of 
water 
in 
a 
measuring 
cup 
and 
poured ScrEv_add_ingredients
the 
water 
into 
the 
bowl 
with 
the 
cake 
mix 
. 
i 
then 
measured RelNScrEv_cake
one-third 
cups 
of 
vegetable 
oil 
and 
also 
poured ScrEv_add_ingredients
the 
oil 
into 
the 
cake 
mix 
bowl 
. 
i 
went ScrEv_get_ingredients
to 
my 
refrigerator 
and 
got ScrEv_get_ingredients
three 
eggs 
out 
of 
the 
carton 
. 
i 
cracked ScrEv_add_ingredients
all 
three 
eggs 
, 
one 
at 
a 
time 
, 
into 
the 
bowl 
. 
i 
turned+on UnrelEv_cake
my 
mixer 
and 
mixed ScrEv_make_dough
the 
cake 
mix 
, 
water 
, 
vegetable 
oil 
, 
and 
eggs 
all 
together 
in 
the 
bowl 
for 
about 
three 
minutes 
. 
when 
all 
the 
ingredients 
were 
fully 
mixed ScrEv_make_dough
together 
and 
formed ScrEv_make_dough
a 
batter 
, 
i 
poured ScrEv_pour_dough
the 
batter 
into 
the 
square 
cake 
pan 
. 
since 
i 
had 
already 
preheated ScrEv_preheat
the 
oven 
, 
i 
put ScrEv_put_cake_oven
the 
pan 
into 
the 
oven 
. 
i 
let UnrelEv_cake
the 
cake 
cook ScrEv_wait
for 
about 
twenty 
minutes 
until 
it 
was 
done 
. 
i 
took ScrEv_take_out_oven
the 
cake 
out 
of 
the 
oven 
and 
let 
it 
cool ScrEv_cool_down
. 
after 
about 
thirty 
minutes 
, 
i 
opened ScrEv_get_ingredients
a 
can 
of 
vanilla 
frosting 
and 
spread ScrEv_decorate
the 
frosting 
across 
the 
top 
of 
the 
cake 
. 
finally 
, 
i 
placed ScrEv_decorate
some 
birthday 
candles 
on 
the 
cake 
to 
celebrate UnrelEv_cake
my 
friend 
's 
birthday 
. 
today 
, 
we 
ate ScrEv_eat
the 
cake 
and 
it 
was UnrelEv_cake
delicious 
! 
<end_of_story>_cake 
it 
was UnrelEv_cake
a 
day 
before 
last 
christmas 
day 
. 
our 
house 
is 
filled UnrelEv_cake
with 
lights 
and 
joy 
. 
on 
every 
christmas 
day 
my 
wife 
makes+very+delicious+fruit+cake Evoking_cake
. 
it 
is UnrelEv_cake
her 
own 
recipe 
. 
everyone 
who 
had 
tasted ScrEv_eat
the 
cake 
before 
asked UnrelEv_cake
her 
the 
recipe 
. 
we 
like UnrelEv_cake
to 
have ScrEv_eat
the 
cake 
with 
red 
wine 
. 
she 
needs UnrelEv_cake
a 
lot 
of 
preparations 
beforehand 
to 
make+this+cake Evoking_cake
. 
she 
soaked ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
raisins 
, 
nuts 
, 
and 
some 
dried 
fruits 
in 
rum 
and 
kept UnrelEv_cake
in 
an 
airtight 
container 
for 
523 
days 
. 
after 
523 
days 
these 
fruits 
absorbed UnrelEv_cake
rum 
and 
adopted UnrelEv_cake
a 
good 
flavor 
. 
so 
she 
usually 
starts UnrelEv_cake
her 
cake 
preparation 
almost 
523 
days 
prior 
to 
christmas 
. 
on 
christmas 
eve 
she 
started UnrelEv_cake
baking Evoking_cake
process 
. 
she 
usually 
make UnrelEv_cake
5-6 
cakes 
for 
us 
and 
for 
some 
friends 
. 
first 
she 
prepared ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
caramel 
syrup 
to 
give UnrelEv_cake
the 
cake 
that 
dark 
color 
. 
after 
that 
she 
mixed ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
all 
purpose 
flour 
and 
baking 
soda 
. 
we 
need UnrelEv_cake
lots 
of 
eggs 
for 
preparing ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
the 
cake 
. 
i 
helped UnrelEv_cake
her 
in 
beating ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
the 
egg 
white 
for 
cake 
. 
after 
mixing ScrEv_make_dough
every 
contents 
well 
, 
she 
poured ScrEv_pour_dough
the 
mix 
into 
the 
baking 
pans 
and 
kept ScrEv_wait
it 
in 
to 
the 
oven 
and 
set ScrEv_set_time
temperature 
and 
time 
to 
get 
it 
done 
. 
when 
the 
oven 
beeped RelNScrEv_cake
, 
she 
took ScrEv_take_out_oven
the 
baking 
pan 
out 
and 
kept UnrelEv_cake
it 
aside 
. 
once 
it 
is 
cooled ScrEv_cool_down
she 
packed UnrelEv_cake
cakes 
for 
friends 
. 
then 
she 
cut ScrEv_eat
our 
cake 
and 
served ScrEv_eat
it 
with 
home 
made UnrelEv_cake
red 
wine 
. 
i 
can 
not 
imagine UnrelEv_cake
a 
christmas 
without 
this 
cake 
. 
after 
having ScrEv_eat
the 
cake 
, 
we 
went UnrelEv_cake
to 
our 
friends 
home 
and 
distributed UnrelEv_cake
the 
cakes 
. 
<end_of_story>_cake 
i 
love UnrelEv_cake
too 
cook Evoking_cake
. 
cooking Evoking_cake
is UnrelEv_cake
far 
easier 
than 
most 
people 
think UnrelEv_cake
, 
in 
fact 
, 
i 
believe UnrelEv_cake
that 
it 
is UnrelEv_cake
often 
as 
easy 
to 
make UnrelEv_cake
good 
food 
from 
scratch 
as 
it 
is UnrelEv_cake
to 
make UnrelEv_cake
something 
from 
a 
box 
, 
and 
it 
tastes UnrelEv_cake
a 
million 
times 
better 
. 
one 
of 
the 
best 
examples 
of 
this 
is UnrelEv_cake
a 
simple 
cake 
. 
a 
basic 
yellow 
cake 
takes UnrelEv_cake
only 
a 
few 
ingredients 
; 
flour 
, 
sugar 
, 
eggs 
milk 
, 
baking 
powder 
, 
salt 
, 
vanilla 
, 
and 
water 
. 
once 
a 
person 
sifts ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
the 
dry 
ingredients 
together 
it 
is UnrelEv_cake
the 
same 
a 
making+a+box+cake+mix Evoking_cake
. 
the 
time 
and 
directions 
are UnrelEv_cake
nearly 
identical 
, 
but 
the 
result 
is UnrelEv_cake
much 
cheaper 
and 
more 
delicious 
than 
anything 
out 
of 
a 
box 
. 
while 
the 
cake 
is 
baking ScrEv_wait
it 
is UnrelEv_cake
wise 
to 
make ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
a 
good 
frosting 
for 
the 
cake 
, 
once 
someone 
has UnrelEv_cake
home 
made 
frosting 
, 
the 
stuff 
in 
a 
can 
tastes UnrelEv_cake
only 
like 
chemicals 
. 
frosting 
is 
even 
easier 
than 
the 
cake 
to 
prepare ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
, 
vanilla 
butter 
cream 
frosting 
the 
just 
; 
powdered 
sugar 
, 
vanilla 
, 
butter 
and 
milk 
. 
when 
mixed ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
in 
the 
correct 
proportions 
and 
whipped+up ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
this 
is UnrelEv_cake
the 
perfect 
topping 
for 
any 
cake 
, 
and 
with 
food 
coloring 
is UnrelEv_cake
an 
excellent 
medium 
for 
any 
decorated 
cakes 
, 
because 
any 
color 
will 
take UnrelEv_cake
easily 
to 
the 
stark 
white 
base 
. 
once 
the 
cake 
is 
baked Unclear_cake
it 
is UnrelEv_cake
important 
to 
watch RelNScrEv_cake
it 
, 
to 
be 
sure 
it 
cools ScrEv_cool_down
enough 
before 
removing ScrEv_take_out_cake_tin
it 
from 
the 
pan 
to 
frost ScrEv_decorate
. 
a 
cake 
plate 
-lrb- 
the 
kind 
on 
a 
small 
pedestal 
-rrb- 
is UnrelEv_cake
the 
perfect 
thing 
to 
make 
guests 
fawn UnrelEv_cake
over 
this 
quick 
and 
easy 
dessert 
.

<end_of_story>_cake 
it 
was UnrelEv_cake
my 
mom 
's 
birthday 
, 
so 
i 
decided UnrelEv_cake
to 
bake+her+a+special+cake Evoking_cake
. 
i 
looked ScrEv_get_ingredients
in 
my 
cabinet 
and 
saw ScrEv_get_ingredients
that 
i 
had UnrelEv_cake
everything 
except 
vanilla 
and 
frosting 
. 
i 
drove ScrEv_get_ingredients
to 
the 
store 
and 
got ScrEv_get_ingredients
the 
ingredients 
i 
needed UnrelEv_cake
and 
went RelNScrEv_cake
back 
home 
. 
once 
i 
was UnrelEv_cake
home 
i 
began UnrelEv_cake
mixing ScrEv_make_dough
the 
cake 
ingredients 
together 
in 
a 
large 
bowl 
. 
then 
i 
took+out ScrEv_get_utensils
a 
cake 
sheet 
and 
poured ScrEv_pour_dough
the 
cake 
batter 
into 
it 
. 
i 
preheated ScrEv_preheat
the 
oven 
and 
placed ScrEv_put_cake_oven
the 
cake 
in 
the 
oven 
. 
i 
began UnrelEv_cake
working ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
on 
my 
frosting 
. 
i 
took+out ScrEv_get_ingredients
some 
butter 
and 
sugar 
and 
mixed ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
them 
together 
adding ScrEv_add_ingredients
a 
few 
more 
ingredients 
to 
taste 
as 
i 
went UnrelEv_cake
. 
i 
checked ScrEv_check
the 
cake 
and 
it 
was 
done 
. 
i 
took ScrEv_take_out_oven
the 
cake 
out 
of 
the 
oven 
and 
let UnrelEv_cake
it 
cool ScrEv_cool_down
. 
then 
i

as 
well 
. 
after

my 
mom

grandma 
june 
was 
making+a+cake Evoking_cake
for 
uncle 
max 
's 
birthday 
. 
uncle 
max 
was UnrelEv_cake
523 
years 
old 
! 
julia 
thought UnrelEv_cake
that 
was 
pretty 
old 
. 
she 
was UnrelEv_cake
excited 
because 
, 
grandma 
june 
agreed UnrelEv_cake
to 
let UnrelEv_cake
her 
help UnrelEv_cake
. 
they 
both 
washed RelNScrEv_cake
their 
hands 
grandma 
june 
said UnrelEv_cake
that 
is UnrelEv_cake
always 
the 
first 
step 
you 
take UnrelEv_cake
when 
cooking Evoking_cake
so 
you 
do 
n't 
spread UnrelEv_cake
germs 
. 
then 
grandma 
june 
picked ScrEv_get_utensils
two 
shiny 
round 
cake 
pans 
. 
she 
let UnrelEv_cake
julia 
grease ScrEv_grease_cake_tin
the 
whole 
inside 
of 
each 
pan 
with 
shortening 
and 
then 
grandma 
june 
dusted ScrEv_grease_cake_tin
each 
pan 
lightly 
with 
flour 
. 
this 
is 
so 
the 
cooked Unclear_cake
cakes 
would 
not 
stick UnrelEv_cake
. 
grandma 
june 
turned ScrEv_preheat
the 
oven 
on 
to 
heat+up ScrEv_preheat
to 
523 
degrees 
then 
she 
placed ScrEv_get_utensils
two 
bowl 
onto 
the 
counter 
one 
was UnrelEv_cake
for 
dry 
things 
such 
as 
flour 
, 
sugar 
, 
baking 
powder 
and 
salt 
. 
grandma 
june 
carefully 
measured RelNScrEv_cake
each 
one 
and 
let 
julia 
pour ScrEv_add_ingredients
them 
in 
. 
then 
she 
mixed ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
all 
the 
dry 
stuff 
really 
well 
. 
julia 
's 
grandma 
june 
told UnrelEv_cake
her 
to 
mix ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
well 
but 
carefully 
so 
the 
ingredients 
would 
not 
spill UnrelEv_cake
because 
baking Evoking_cake
is 
an 
exact 
science 
and 
the 
measurements 
had 
to 
be UnrelEv_cake
correct 
. 
in 
the 
next 
bowl 
they 
measured RelNScrEv_cake
all 
the 
wet 
things 
. 
in 
went ScrEv_add_ingredients
butter 
, 
milk 
, 
vanilla 
and 
eggs 
. 
grandma 
june 
mixed ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
them 
very 
smooth 
with 
a 
hand 
mixer 
. 
next 
they 
slowly 
added ScrEv_add_ingredients
the 
wet 
ingredients 
to 
the 
dry 
a 
bit 
at 
a 
time 
mixing ScrEv_make_dough
them 
well 
into 
a 
smooth 
batter 
. 
the 
batter 
get 
divided ScrEv_pour_dough
evenly 
between 
the 
two 
cake 
pans 
and 
placed ScrEv_put_cake_oven
in 
the 
hot 
oven 
to 
bake ScrEv_wait
. 
after 
thirty 
minutes 
grandma 
june 
poked ScrEv_check
each 
cake 
with 
a 
toothpick 
and 
it 
came+out ScrEv_check
with 
no 
cake 
on 
it 
. 
this 
meant UnrelEv_cake
the 
cakes 
were 
done 
. 
grandma 
june 
carefully 
flipped ScrEv_take_out_cake_tin
the 
cakes 
over 
onto 
a 
cooling 
rack 
leave ScrEv_cool_down
the 
cake 
there 
with 
no 
pan 
on 
it 
to 
cool ScrEv_cool_down
. 
julia 
waited ScrEv_wait
for 
what 
seemed 
like 
a 
very 
long 
time 
until 
grandma 
june 
said UnrelEv_cake
they 
were 
cool 
. 
she 
brought+out ScrEv_get_utensils
her 
cake 
stand 
and 
placed UnrelEv_cake
one 
cake 
on 
it 
. 
julia 
watched UnrelEv_cake
as 
grandma 
june 
frosted ScrEv_decorate
the 
layer 
lightly 
then 
placed ScrEv_decorate
the 
other 
cake 
on 
top 
. 
she 
made UnrelEv_cake
quick 
work 
of 
frosting ScrEv_decorate
both 
layers 
of 
stacked 
cakes 
with 
smooth 
fluffy 
white 
frosting 
. 
then 
came UnrelEv_cake
julias 
part 
. 
she 
placed ScrEv_decorate
the 
bid 
number 
four 
and 
five 
shaped 
candles 
next 
to 
each 
other 
on 
the 
cake 
. 
julia 
thought UnrelEv_cake
making+a+cake Evoking_cake
was 
lots 
of 
work 
but 
fun 
as 
well 
. 
especially 
when 
she 
did UnrelEv_cake
it 
with 
her 
grandma 
. 
<end_of_story>_cake 
today 
, 
i 
decided UnrelEv_cake
to 
bake+a+cake Evoking_cake
. 
first 
, 
i 
preheated ScrEv_preheat
the 
oven 
to 
523 
degrees 
. 
then 
, 
i 
gathered ScrEv_get_ingredients
all 
the 
ingredients 
i 
would 
need UnrelEv_cake
. 
i 
needed UnrelEv_cake
eggs 
, 
flour 
, 
water 
, 
sugar 
, 
oil 
, 
salt 
, 
and 
baking 
power 
. 
i 
took ScrEv_get_utensils
a 
mixing 
bowl 
and 
cracked ScrEv_add_ingredients
the 
eggs 
into 
the 
bowl 
. 
then 
i 
measured RelNScrEv_cake
out 
the 
water 
, 
followed 
by 
the 
oil 
. 
after 
that 
, 
i 
added ScrEv_add_ingredients
the 
dry 
ingredients 
. 
then 
i 
took ScrEv_get_utensils
a 
spoon 
and 
mixed ScrEv_make_dough
everything 
together 
until 
it 
was UnrelEv_cake
smooth 
and 
there 
were UnrelEv_cake
no 
more 
lumps 
. 
that 
's 
when 
the 
oven 
beeped RelNScrEv_cake
to 
indicate UnrelEv_cake
that 
the 
oven 
had 
reached RelNScrEv_cake
the 
correct 
temperature 
. 
i 
took+out ScrEv_get_utensils
a 
pan 
and 
greased ScrEv_grease_cake_tin
the 
bottom 
so 
that 
the 
cake 
would 
not 
stick UnrelEv_cake
to 
it 
. 
then 
i 
poured ScrEv_pour_dough
the 
mixture 
from 
the 
bowl 
into 
the 
pan 
. 
because 
the 
oven 
was UnrelEv_cake
ready 
, 
i 
put ScrEv_put_cake_oven
the 
pan 
on 
a 
rack 
in 
the 
center 
of 
the 
oven 
. 
then 
i 
set ScrEv_set_time
the 
timer 
to 
523 
minutes 
. 
when 
the 
timer 
went+off RelNScrEv_cake
, 
i 
put+on ScrEv_get_utensils
some 
oven 
mitts 
and 
took ScrEv_take_out_oven
the 
cake 
out 
of 
the 
oven 
. 
then 
i 
turned+off ScrEv_turn_off_oven
the 
oven 
and 
let UnrelEv_cake
the 
cake 
cool ScrEv_cool_down
. 
<end_of_story>_cake 
it 
was UnrelEv_cake
my 
sisters 
birthday 
recently 
and 
she 
wanted 
to 
have UnrelEv_cake
a 
cake 
, 
of 
course 
. 
she 
likes UnrelEv_cake
chocolate 
, 
so 
she 
chose UnrelEv_cake
a 
chocolate 
cake 
. 
we 
always 
bake+our+own+cakes Evoking_cake
rather 
than 
purchasing UnrelEv_cake
them 
, 
so 
i 
knew UnrelEv_cake
we 
needed UnrelEv_cake
to 
find ScrEv_choose_recipe
a 
tried 
and 
true 
recipe 
. 
we 
found ScrEv_choose_recipe
the 
recipe 
from 
a 
blog 
and 
made RelNScrEv_cake
a 
list 
of 
the 
ingredients 
that 
we 
did 
not 
already 
have UnrelEv_cake
. 
we 
had 
to 
do ScrEv_get_ingredients
a 
trip 
to 
the 
grocery 
store 
to 
pick+up ScrEv_get_ingredients
a 
few 
items 
that 
are UnrelEv_cake
essential 
to 
baking+a+chocolate+cake Evoking_cake
, 
one 
of 
which 
is UnrelEv_cake
baker 
's 
chocolate 
. 
once 
we 
got RelNScrEv_cake
home 
from 
the 
store 
, 
we 
followed UnrelEv_cake
the 
instructions 
included UnrelEv_cake
in 
the 
recipe 
. 
we 
started UnrelEv_cake
like 
always 
; 
by 
pre-heating ScrEv_preheat
the 
oven 
to 
the 
correct 
temperature 
. 
next 
, 
we 
began UnrelEv_cake
to 
make+the+cake Evoking_cake
. 
first 
, 
we 
make+sure UnrelEv_cake
dry 
ingredients 
are 
mixed ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
well 
and 
then 
we 
moved+on UnrelEv_cake
to 
the 
wet 
ingredients 
. 
this 
is UnrelEv_cake
so 
important 
for 
the 
distribution 
of 
things 
like 
the 
baking 
soda 
. 
it 
's UnrelEv_cake
what 
makes UnrelEv_cake
a 
cake 
a 
cake 
. 
when 
the 
cake 
batter 
was UnrelEv_cake
ready 
and 
the 
oven 
was UnrelEv_cake
hot 
, 
we 
poured ScrEv_pour_dough
the 
batter 
into 
a 
pan 
and 
slipped ScrEv_put_cake_oven
the 
pan 
in 
the 
oven 
. 
the 
timer 
was 
set ScrEv_set_time
for 
the 
correct 
amount 
of 
time 
given UnrelEv_cake
by 
the 
recipe 
, 
and 
then 
we 
just 
waited ScrEv_wait
. 
once 
the 
cake 
was 
done 
we 
took ScrEv_take_out_oven
it 
out 
of 
the 
oven 
and 
set UnrelEv_cake
it 
up 
to 
cool ScrEv_cool_down
before 
we 
put+on ScrEv_decorate
the 
icing 
. 
the 
cake 
turned+out UnrelEv_cake
beautiful 
and 
my 
sister 
had UnrelEv_cake
a 
very 
happy 
birthday 
. 
<end_of_story>_cake 
the 
church 
was 
having UnrelEv_cake
a 
bake 
sale 
. 
i 
decided UnrelEv_cake
to 
make+a+pineapple+upside+down+cake Evoking_cake
, 
as 
they 
are UnrelEv_cake
my 
favorite 
. 
i 
realized UnrelEv_cake
i 
needed UnrelEv_cake
a 
few 
ingredients 
so 
i 
made+sure UnrelEv_cake
to 
include RelNScrEv_cake
them 
in 
my 
shopping 
list 
when 
i 
went ScrEv_get_ingredients
to 
the 
store 
. 
after 
i 
got RelNScrEv_cake
home 
from 
shopping ScrEv_get_ingredients
i 
gathered ScrEv_get_ingredients
all 
the 
ingredients 
and 
equipment 
on 
the 
counter 
, 
opened UnrelEv_cake
the 
cookbook 
, 
and 
turned+on ScrEv_preheat
the 
oven 
. 
first 
i 
layered ScrEv_add_ingredients
the 
pineapple 
in 
the 
baking 
dish 
, 
placed ScrEv_add_ingredients
the 
cherries 
in 
the 
center 
of 
the 
rings 
and 
sprinkled ScrEv_add_ingredients
the 
brown 
sugar 
on 
. 
in 
the 
bowl 
i 
measured RelNScrEv_cake
and 
added ScrEv_add_ingredients
all 
the 
dry 
ingredients 
and 
mixed ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
them 
before 
adding ScrEv_add_ingredients
the 
wet 
ingredients 
in 
the 
order 
suggested UnrelEv_cake
by 
the 
recipe 
. 
after 
stirring ScrEv_make_dough
the 
appropriate 
amount 
of 
time 
i 
carefully 
poured ScrEv_pour_dough
the 
batter 
into 
the 
baking 
dish 
, 
over 
the 
pineapple 
. 
i 
placed ScrEv_put_cake_oven
the 
dish 
in 
the 
oven 
, 
set ScrEv_set_time
the 
timer 
, 
and 
when 
the 
timer 
rang RelNScrEv_cake
i 
checked ScrEv_check
it 
then 
removed ScrEv_take_out_oven
it 
. 
i 
took UnrelEv_cake
it 
to 
church 
in 
the 
pan 
and 
placed UnrelEv_cake
it 
on 
a 
tray 
there 
as 
it 
was UnrelEv_cake
easier 
to 
transport UnrelEv_cake
that 
way 
. 
it 
looked UnrelEv_cake
delicious 
and 
sold UnrelEv_cake
for 
more 
than 
any 
of 
the 
other 
cakes 
. 
<end_of_story>_cake 
last 
week 
was UnrelEv_cake
my 
friend 
's 
birthday 
. 
i 
asked UnrelEv_cake
him 
if 
he 
was 
going 
to 
do UnrelEv_cake
anything 
special 
and 
he 
said 
no UnrelEv_cake
. 
i 
felt UnrelEv_cake
bad 
for 
him 
, 
so 
i 
said UnrelEv_cake
i 
would 
at 
least 
bake+him+a+cake Evoking_cake
. 
maybe 
this 
was UnrelEv_cake
a 
hasty 
decision 
since 
i 
have UnrelEv_cake
no 
experience 
baking+cakes Evoking_cake
. 
so 
i 
looked ScrEv_choose_recipe
online 
to 
see UnrelEv_cake
what 
i 
needed 
to 
do UnrelEv_cake
. 
i 
found ScrEv_choose_recipe
a 
recipe 
that 
looked UnrelEv_cake
easy 
enough 
, 
so 
later 
that 
day 
i 
drove ScrEv_get_ingredients
over 
to 
the 
grocery 
store 
to 
buy ScrEv_get_ingredients
all 
the 
ingredients 
i 
would 
need UnrelEv_cake
to 
bake+the+cake Evoking_cake
. 
when 
i 
got+to ScrEv_get_ingredients
the 
store 
i 
started 
gathering ScrEv_get_ingredients
up 
everything 
i 
needed 
. 
once 
i 
almost 
had UnrelEv_cake
everything 
i 
turned+down UnrelEv_cake
an 
aisle 
and 
noticed UnrelEv_cake
there 
were UnrelEv_cake
boxed 
of 
pre-made ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
cake 
mix 
i 
could 
buy ScrEv_get_ingredients
. 
this 
seemed UnrelEv_cake
like 
an 
easy 
option 
, 
so 
i 
put UnrelEv_cake
all 
the 
ingredients 
back 
and 
bought ScrEv_get_ingredients
one 
of 
those 
mixes 
. 
i 
got RelNScrEv_cake
home 
and 
started UnrelEv_cake
baking Evoking_cake
. 
all 
i 
needed 
to 
add ScrEv_add_ingredients
to 
the 
mix 
was 
a 
couple 
eggs 
and 
some 
vegetable 
oil 
. 
after 
it 
was ScrEv_wait
in 
the 
oven 
for 
an 
hour 
the 
cake 
was UnrelEv_cake
ready 
. 
<end_of_story>_cake 
i 
decided UnrelEv_cake
to 
bake+a+chocolate+cake Evoking_cake
yesterday 
. 
first 
, 
i 
consulted ScrEv_choose_recipe
my 
recipe 
book 
and 
found ScrEv_choose_recipe
the 
recipe 
i 
wanted 
to 
use UnrelEv_cake
. 
next 
, 
i 
looked+through ScrEv_get_ingredients
my 
kitchen 
and 
made+sure ScrEv_get_ingredients
that 
i 
had UnrelEv_cake
all 
the 
ingredients 
that 
i 
needed UnrelEv_cake
for 
my 
cake 
. 
i 
did 
have UnrelEv_cake
them 
, 
so 
i 
began UnrelEv_cake
to 
pull ScrEv_get_ingredients
them 
all 
out 
. 
i 
preheated ScrEv_preheat
the 
oven 
, 
and 
greased ScrEv_grease_cake_tin
a 
cake 
pan 
. 
i 
mixed+up ScrEv_make_dough
all 
of 
the 
ingredients 
in 
a 
big 
mixing 
bowl 
. 
i 
poured ScrEv_pour_dough
the 
mixture 
carefully 
into 
the 
cake 
pan 
. 
i 
carefully 
placed ScrEv_put_cake_oven
it 
into 
the 
oven 
and 
set ScrEv_set_time
the 
timer 
according 
to 
the 
recipe 
. 
while 
the 
cake 
was 
baking ScrEv_wait
, 
i 
cleaned+up RelNScrEv_cake
the 
mess 
in 
the 
kitchen 
. 
then 
i 
made ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
chocolate 
frosting 
to 
go+on ScrEv_decorate
the 
cake 
. 
the 
timer 
buzzed RelNScrEv_cake
, 
i 
pulled ScrEv_take_out_oven
the 
cake 
out 
of 
the 
oven 
and 
saw ScrEv_check
that 
it 
was 
done 
. 
i 
set UnrelEv_cake
it 
out 
to 
cool ScrEv_cool_down
. 
once 
it 
was UnrelEv_cake
cool 
, 
i 
took ScrEv_get_ingredients
the 
frosting 
i 
had 
just 
made ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
and 
frosted ScrEv_decorate
the 
cake 
. 
the 
cake 
was UnrelEv_cake
complete 
and 
i 
served ScrEv_eat
it 
to 
my 
family 
for 
dessert 
after 
dinner 
that 
night 
. 
<end_of_story>_cake 
thursday 
was UnrelEv_cake
my 
friend 
tony 
's 
birthday 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_cake
also 
the 
day 
before 
passover 
, 
which 
starts UnrelEv_cake
an 
eight-day 
stretch 
when 
he 
wo 
n't 
be 
able 
to 
eat UnrelEv_cake
a 
lot 
of 
foods 
, 
including UnrelEv_cake
foods 
with 
leavening 
agents 
and 
confectioner 
's 
sugar 
. 
that 
meant UnrelEv_cake
no 
cake 
for 
tony 
after 
thursday 
, 
so 
i 
thought UnrelEv_cake
it 
would 
be UnrelEv_cake
a 
nice 
treat 
to 
make+him+a+cake Evoking_cake
for 
that 
day 
. 
he 
has UnrelEv_cake
very 
simple 
tastes 
, 
and 
likes UnrelEv_cake
white 
vanilla 
cake 
with 
butter 
cream 
frosting 
. 
i 
did 
n't 
have UnrelEv_cake
any 
of 
the 
ingredients 
on 
hand 
except 
for 
vanilla 
, 
eggs 
, 
baking 
soda 
, 
and 
baking 
powder 
, 
so 
i 
had 
to 
go+to ScrEv_get_ingredients
the 
store 
to 
get ScrEv_get_ingredients
flour 
, 
sugar 
, 
and 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
things 
that 
would 
go+into UnrelEv_cake
the 
cake 
. 
when 
i 
got RelNScrEv_cake
home 
, 
i 
mixed ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
the 
ingredients 
in 
a 
bowl 
, 
first 
sifting ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
the 
dry 
ingredients 
together 
, 
and 
then 
beating+in ScrEv_make_dough
the 
butter 
, 
eggs 
, 
and 
sugar 
. 
i 
baked ScrEv_wait
the 
cake 
at 
523 
degrees 
for 
523 
minutes 
, 
then 
took ScrEv_take_out_oven
it 
out 
of 
the 
oven 
, 
let UnrelEv_cake
it 
cool ScrEv_cool_down
, 
and 
frosted ScrEv_decorate
it 
. 
the 
cake 
was UnrelEv_cake
delicious 
, 
and 
tony 
was UnrelEv_cake
very 
touched UnrelEv_cake
by 
the 
effort 
. 
<end_of_story>_cake 
baking+a+cake Evoking_cake
can 
be UnrelEv_cake
a 
lot 
of 
fun 
. 
plus 
, 
at 
the 
end 
, 
you 
have UnrelEv_cake
a 
yummy 
cake 
to 
eat ScrEv_eat
! 
first 
, 
decide UnrelEv_cake
what 
kind 
of 
cake+to+make Evoking_cake
. 
do 
you 
have UnrelEv_cake
a 
recipe 
written+down UnrelEv_cake
? 
a 
recipe 
is UnrelEv_cake
a 
set 
of 
instructions 
for 
making+a+particular+cake Evoking_cake
. 
make 
sure 
to 
read RelNScrEv_cake
the 
recipe 
all 
the 
way 
through 
before 
you 
start UnrelEv_cake
, 
so 
there 
are UnrelEv_cake
no 
surprises 
! 
then 
gather ScrEv_get_ingredients
all 
your 
ingredients 
together 
: 
flour 
, 
sugar 
, 
eggs 
, 
and 
whatever 
else 
your 
recipe 
says UnrelEv_cake
. 
next 
, 
you 
need 
to 
pre-heat ScrEv_preheat
the 
oven 
. 
your 
recipe 
will 
tell UnrelEv_cake
you 
what 
temperature 
to 
use UnrelEv_cake
. 
while 
the 
oven 
heats+up ScrEv_preheat
, 
you 
mix ScrEv_make_dough
your 
ingredients 
in 
a 
big 
bowl 
. 
next 
, 
you 
need 
to 
prepare ScrEv_grease_cake_tin
the 
baking 
pans 
. 
look RelNScrEv_cake
again 
at 
the 
recipe 
. 
it 
will 
tell UnrelEv_cake
you 
what 
size 
pan 
to 
use UnrelEv_cake
, 
and 
whether 
it 
needs 
to 
be 
greased ScrEv_grease_cake_tin
. 
to 
grease ScrEv_grease_cake_tin
a 
pan 
means 
to 
put ScrEv_grease_cake_tin
a 
thin 
layer 
of 
shortening 
or 
butter 
on 
the 
bottom 
and 
sides 
, 
so 
the 
cake 
wo 
n't 
stick UnrelEv_cake
. 
you 
'll 
use UnrelEv_cake
two 
pans 
if 
you 
're 
making+a+layered+cake Evoking_cake
. 
when 
the 
pan 
or 
pans 
are UnrelEv_cake
ready 
, 
pour ScrEv_pour_dough
in 
the 
well-mixed ScrEv_make_dough
ingredients 
. 
check RelNScrEv_cake
if 
the 
oven 
is 
hot 
enough 
-- 
has 
it 
reached UnrelEv_cake
the 
temperature 
you 
set ScrEv_preheat
it 
to 
yet 
? 
if 
so 
, 
slide ScrEv_put_cake_oven
your 
pan 
right 
into 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
oven 
, 
and 
close ScrEv_put_cake_oven
it 
up 
. 
the 
recipe 
will 
say UnrelEv_cake
how 
many 
minutes 
it 
will 
take ScrEv_wait
for 
the 
cake 
to 
bake ScrEv_wait
. 
it 
's 
a 
good 
idea 
to 
set ScrEv_set_time
a 
timer 
, 
because 
you 
do 
n't 
want 
to 
forget UnrelEv_cake
about 
it 
, 
and 
have UnrelEv_cake
a 
burnt RelNScrEv_cake
cake 
, 
after 
all 
your 
hard 
work 
! 
while 
the 
cake 
cooks ScrEv_wait
, 
it 
's 
a 
good 
idea 
to 
clean+up RelNScrEv_cake
the 
kitchen 
. 
you 
're UnrelEv_cake
almost 
there 
! 
when 
your 
timer 
goes+off RelNScrEv_cake
, 
you 
can 
check ScrEv_check
if 
the 
cake 
is 
done 
by 
sticking ScrEv_check
a 
toothpick 
into 
the 
middle 
. 
if 
the 
toothpick 
comes+out ScrEv_check
dry 
, 
and 
not 
gooey 
, 
your 
cake 
is 
done 
. 
turn+off ScrEv_turn_off_oven
the 
oven 
, 
and 
carefully 
remove ScrEv_take_out_oven
the 
hot 
cake 
with 
oven 
mitts 
on 
. 
unfortunately 
, 
now 
you 
have 
to 
leave UnrelEv_cake
it 
alone 
until 
it 
cools ScrEv_cool_down
. 
when 
it 
's 
cooled ScrEv_cool_down
, 
turn ScrEv_take_out_cake_tin
it 
out 
of 
the 
pan 
, 
and 
put ScrEv_decorate
the 
frosting 
on 
, 
if 
your 
cake 
is UnrelEv_cake
a 
frosted ScrEv_decorate
cake 
. 
next 
is UnrelEv_cake
the 
best 
part 
: 
slice ScrEv_eat
that 
cake 
into 
eight 
, 
put ScrEv_eat
a 
slice 
on 
a 
plate 
, 
and 
enjoy ScrEv_eat
!

<end_of_story>_cake 
just 
the 
other 
day 
i 
baked+a+cake Evoking_cake
. 
i 
found ScrEv_choose_recipe
a 
recipe 
online 
for 
a 
chocolate 
cake 
that 
i 
really 
wanted 
to 
try UnrelEv_cake
, 
so 
i 
went ScrEv_get_ingredients
to 
the 
store 
and 
bought ScrEv_get_ingredients
all 
the 
ingredients 
. 
then 
i 
went RelNScrEv_cake
home 
and 
put ScrEv_get_ingredients
everything 
out 
onto 
the 
counter 
, 
including UnrelEv_cake
my 
mixing 
bowls 
, 
measuring 
cups 
, 
and 
baking 
dish 
. 
the 
first 
thing 
i 
did UnrelEv_cake
was 
to 
mix ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
the 
flour 
, 
water 
, 
sugar 
, 
butter 
, 
eggs 
and 
chocolate 
together 
in 
my 
big 
mixing 
bowl 
. 
i 
then 
greased ScrEv_grease_cake_tin
up 
my 
baking 
dish 
with 
oil 
, 
so 
the 
cake 
would 
n't 
stick UnrelEv_cake
to 
it 
while 
it 
was 
baking ScrEv_wait
. 
then 
i 
set ScrEv_preheat
the 
oven 
temperature 
to 
523 
degrees 
and 
let 
it 
preheat ScrEv_preheat
. 
after 
all 
my 
ingredients 
were UnrelEv_cake
in 
the 
bowl 
, 
i 
used UnrelEv_cake
a 
big 
spoon 
to 
stir ScrEv_make_dough
everything 
together 
until 
it 
was 
nice 
and 
mixed+up ScrEv_make_dough
. 
then 
i 
poured ScrEv_pour_dough
the 
batter 
into 
my 
baking 
dish 
, 
and 
put ScrEv_put_cake_oven
it 
into 
the 
oven 
. 
i 
let 
it 
bake ScrEv_wait
for 
an 
hour 
, 
then 
took+out ScrEv_take_out_oven
the 
cake 
and 
let 
it 
cool ScrEv_cool_down
. 
after 
it 
was UnrelEv_cake
cool 
i 
put ScrEv_decorate
icing 
on 
it 
, 
and 
cut ScrEv_eat
it 
into 
pieces 
to 
save UnrelEv_cake
for 
later 
. 
then 
i 
cleaned+up RelNScrEv_cake
my 
huge 
mess 
. 
<end_of_story>_cake 
my 
best 
friend 
was 
having UnrelEv_cake
a 
birthday 
party 
in 
a 
few 
days 
, 
so 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_cake
to 
make+her+cake Evoking_cake
that 
everyone 
would 
love UnrelEv_cake
. 
i 
looked+through ScrEv_choose_recipe
my 
book 
of 
recipes 
and 
found ScrEv_choose_recipe
a 
recipe 
for 
chocolate 
cake 
that 
looked UnrelEv_cake
delicious 
. 
the 
recipe 
had RelNScrEv_cake
a 
list 
of 
ingredients 
and 
steps 
for 
making+the+cake Evoking_cake
. 
i 
read ScrEv_other_cake
the 
whole 
thing 
to 
make+sure UnrelEv_cake
i 
did 
n't 
have 
to 
go RelNScrEv_cake
to 
the 
store 
to 
buy ScrEv_get_ingredients
any 
of 
the 
food 
or 
cooking 
supplies 
needed 
to 
make+the+cake Evoking_cake
. 
it 
said UnrelEv_cake
i 
needed RelNScrEv_cake
a 
big 
bowl 
, 
a 
mixer 
, 
a 
spatula 
, 
measuring 
cups 
, 
a 
pot 
, 
and 
a 
baking 
dish 
. 
i 
took ScrEv_get_utensils
each 
of 
these 
out 
of 
my 
cabinets 
and 
placed ScrEv_other_cake
them 
on 
the 
table 
so 
they 
were UnrelEv_cake
ready 
to 
use RelNScrEv_cake
. 
then 
it 
said UnrelEv_cake
i 
needed RelNScrEv_cake
two 
eggs 
, 
flour 
, 
sugar 
, 
milk 
, 
chocolate 
, 
and 
frosting 
. 
i 
took ScrEv_get_ingredients
these 
out 
of 
my 
cabinets 
and 
refrigerator 
so 
that 
they 
were UnrelEv_cake
ready 
as 
well 
. 
once 
i 
was UnrelEv_cake
sure 
i 
had UnrelEv_cake
everything 
i 
needed RelNScrEv_cake
, 
i 
started UnrelEv_cake
reading ScrEv_other_cake
the 
instructions 
again 
, 
one 
by 
one 
. 
on 
the 
first 
step 
, 
i 
had 
to 
preheat ScrEv_preheat
the 
oven 
by 
turning ScrEv_preheat
it 
to 
the 
right 
temperature 
early 
so 
that 
it 
is UnrelEv_cake
warm 
enough 
to 
bake RelNScrEv_cake
when 
i 
am UnrelEv_cake
ready 
to 
put ScrEv_put_cake_oven
the 
batter 
inside 
. 
then 
i 
had 
to 
start UnrelEv_cake
making ScrEv_make_dough
the 
batter 
. 
first 
i 
cracked ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
the 
eggs 
into 
the 
big 
bowl 
and 
threw+away ScrEv_other_cake
the 
shells 
. 
then 
i 
used UnrelEv_cake
my 
measuring 
cups 
to 
very 
carefully 
scoop RelNScrEv_cake
the 
exact 
amount 
of 
flour 
the 
recipe 
asked 
for 
and 
poured ScrEv_add_ingredients
it 
in 
the 
bowl 
. 
next 
i 
measured ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
and 
poured ScrEv_add_ingredients
the 
sugar 
and 
milk 
the 
same 
way 
. 
i 
put ScrEv_other_cake
the 
mixer 
into 
the 
bowl 
and 
turned ScrEv_make_dough
it 
on 
for 
a 
minute 
. 
when 
i 
turned ScrEv_other_cake
it 
off 
again 
, 
i 
could 
no 
longer 
see UnrelEv_cake
each 
ingredient 
, 
and 
the 
batter 
looked UnrelEv_cake
like 
sticky 
goop 
instead 
. 
the 
recipe 
then 
said UnrelEv_cake
to 
melt ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
the 
chocolate 
on 
the 
stove 
in 
the 
pot 
. 
i 
put ScrEv_other_cake
the 
chocolate 
in 
the 
pot 
on 
the 
stove 
, 
turned ScrEv_other_cake
it 
on 
, 
and 
watched UnrelEv_cake
it 
turn UnrelEv_cake
from 
solid 
to 
liquid 
. 
then 
i 
poured ScrEv_add_ingredients
it 
into 
the 
big 
bowl 
and 
mixed ScrEv_make_dough
it 
up 
again 
. 
once 
i 
had UnrelEv_cake
my 
chocolate 
batter 
, 
i 
gently 
poured ScrEv_pour_dough
it 
into 
my 
baking 
dish 
and 
was UnrelEv_cake
ready 
to 
put ScrEv_put_cake_oven
it 
into 
the 
oven 
. 
i 
put RelNScrEv_cake
on 
oven 
mitts 
to 
protect RelNScrEv_cake
my 
hands 
from 
the 
heat 
and 
carefully 
put ScrEv_put_cake_oven
the 
dish 
into 
the 
oven 
. 
following RelNScrEv_cake
the 
recipe 
's 
instructions 
, 
i 
set ScrEv_set_time
the 
oven 
timer 
for 
an 
hour 
and 
waited ScrEv_wait
for 
it 
to 
bake RelNScrEv_cake
. 
once 
i 
heard UnrelEv_cake
the 
timer 
chime ScrEv_other_cake
, 
i 
put RelNScrEv_cake
on 
the 
oven 
mitts 
again 
and 
took ScrEv_take_out_oven
the 
cake 
out 
to 
cool RelNScrEv_cake
. 
i 
turned ScrEv_other_cake
the 
oven 
off 
and 
waited ScrEv_wait
for 
the 
cake 
to 
cool+down ScrEv_cool_down
. 
the 
batter 
was UnrelEv_cake
now 
soft 
and 
firm 
instead 
of 
goop 
. 
once 
it 
was UnrelEv_cake
cool 
, 
i 
put ScrEv_take_out_cake_tin
it 
on 
a 
plate 
and 
spread 
the 
frosting 
all 
over 
it 
with 
my 
spatula 
. 
finally 
, 
the 
cake 
was 
done UnrelEv_cake

<end_of_story>_cake 
it 
was UnrelEv_cake
my 
little 
sister 
's 
birthday 
and 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_cake
to 
bake+her+a+cake Evoking_cake
. 
i 
found ScrEv_choose_recipe
a 
recipe 
for 
chocolate 
cake 
, 
which 
i 
knew+was UnrelEv_cake
her 
favorite 
. 
i 
gathered ScrEv_get_ingredients
together 
all 
of 
the 
ingredients 
along 
with 
a 
bowl 
and 
a 
mixer 
. 
i 
measured ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
out 
the 
flour 
, 
sugar 
, 
vanilla 
, 
chocolate 
, 
eggs 
, 
and 
water 
and 
put ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
them 
into 
the 
bowl 
. 
i 
used UnrelEv_cake
the 
electric 
mixer 
to 
mix ScrEv_make_dough
the 
batter 
until 
it 
was UnrelEv_cake
very 
smooth 
. 
i 
greased ScrEv_grease_cake_tin
a 
cake 
pan 
and 
put ScrEv_other_cake
a 
little 
flour 
into 
the 
bottom 
and 
shook RelNScrEv_cake
it 
around 
. 
this 
would 
keep UnrelEv_cake
the 
cake 
from 
sticking RelNScrEv_cake
to 
the 
pan 
while 
it 
cooked RelNScrEv_cake
. 
i 
poured ScrEv_pour_dough
the 
batter 
into 
the 
pan 
and 
placed ScrEv_put_cake_oven
it 
in 
the 
oven 
, 
which 
i 
had 
preheated ScrEv_preheat
to 
523 
degrees 
. 
i 
set ScrEv_set_time
a 
timer 
for 
523 
minutes 
. 
while 
the 
cake 
was 
baking RelNScrEv_cake
, 
i 
mixed ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
together 
some 
sugar 
, 
vanilla 
and 
milk 
to 
make RelNScrEv_cake
frosting 
. 
when 
the 
timer 
sounded ScrEv_other_cake
, 
i 
took ScrEv_take_out_oven
the 
cake 
out 
of 
the 
oven 
and 
let UnrelEv_cake
it 
cool ScrEv_cool_down
. 
i 
turned ScrEv_take_out_cake_tin
it 
upside 
down 
onto 
a 
serving 
platter 
and 
put ScrEv_decorate
the 
frosting 
on 
. 
i 
used UnrelEv_cake
a 
special 
frosting 
bag 
and 
tip 
to 
write ScrEv_decorate
'' 
`` 
happy 
birthday 
'' 
'' 
on 
the 
top 
. 
my 
sister 
loved UnrelEv_cake

ingredients 
all 
together 
until 
the 
consistency 
of 
the 
cake 
mix 
is UnrelEv_cake
smooth 
and 
there 
are UnrelEv_cake
no 
chunks 
. 
then 
i 
slowly 
pour ScrEv_pour_dough
the 
batter 
into 
a 
cake 
pan 
and 
ensure RelNScrEv_cake
that 
the 
batter 
is 
even 
in 
the 
pan 
. 
sometimes 
i 
use UnrelEv_cake
cooking 
spray 
to 
oil ScrEv_grease_cake_tin
the 
pan 
and 
sometimes 
i 
forget UnrelEv_cake
but 
honestly 
i 
feel UnrelEv_cake
like 
it 
does 
not 
make UnrelEv_cake
that 
big 
of 
a 
difference 
. 
then 
i 
cook ScrEv_put_cake_oven
the 
cake 
and 
wait ScrEv_wait
until 
it 
is 
done UnrelEv_cake
. 
sometimes 
i 
like UnrelEv_cake
to 
look+through UnrelEv_cake
the 
window 
on 
the 
oven 
door 
and 
watch UnrelEv_cake
how 
the 
cake 
will 
rise RelNScrEv_cake
in 
the 
cake 
pan 
. 
then 
i 
love UnrelEv_cake
to 
smell RelNScrEv_cake
the 
cake 
as 
the 
aroma 
fills RelNScrEv_cake
the 
entire 
house 
, 
oh 
i 
love UnrelEv_cake
this 
part 
so 
much 
. 
then 
the 
timer 
beeps ScrEv_other_cake
and 
i 
am UnrelEv_cake
so 
happy 
. 
the 
most 
important 
part 
of 
baking+a+cake Evoking_cake
, 
as 
my 
mother 
always 
told UnrelEv_cake
me 
, 
is UnrelEv_cake
to 
turn+off ScrEv_turn_off_oven
the 
oven 
when 
the 
cake 
is 
doing UnrelEv_cake
baking RelNScrEv_cake
. 
i 
pull ScrEv_take_out_oven
it 
out 
and 
use ScrEv_check
a 
toothpick 
to 
make+sure UnrelEv_cake
that 
the 
cake 
is 
done UnrelEv_cake
by 
making+sure UnrelEv_cake
that 
the 
toothpick 
comes+out RelNScrEv_cake
clean 
from 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
cake 
. 
then 
i 
wait ScrEv_wait
a 
while 
and 
then 
i 
mix ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
together 
some 
frosting 
. 
i 
spread ScrEv_decorate
the 
frosting 
on 
the 
cake 
and 
cut ScrEv_other_cake
myself 
a 
piece 
and 
i 
eat ScrEv_eat
it 
! 
it 
tastes UnrelEv_cake
so 
amazing 
! 
! 
<end_of_story>_cake 
i 
recently 
made+a+cake Evoking_cake
for 
a 
friend 
to 
thank UnrelEv_cake
them 
for 
helping UnrelEv_cake
me 
with 
something 
. 
since 
i 
knew UnrelEv_cake
that 
they 
liked UnrelEv_cake
chocolate 
cake 
the 
best 
, 
i 
looked ScrEv_choose_recipe
in 
my 
cookbook 
for 
a 
good 
recipe 
to 
follow RelNScrEv_cake
. 
i 
soon 
found ScrEv_choose_recipe
one 
that 
looked UnrelEv_cake
tasty 
and 
i 
had UnrelEv_cake
all 
of 
the 
ingredients 
on 
hand 
, 
since 
that 
's UnrelEv_cake
the 
first 
thing 
that 
i 
do UnrelEv_cake
before 
committing RelNScrEv_cake
to 
a 
recipe 
, 
since 
i 
do UnrelEv_cake
n't 
want 
to 
have 
to 
run RelNScrEv_cake
to 
the 
store 
in 
the 
middle 
of 
making RelNScrEv_cake
something 
. 
i 
set ScrEv_preheat
the 
oven 
to 
the 
appropriate 
temperature 
, 
after 
being UnrelEv_cake
sure 
to 
double 
check ScrEv_other_cake
it 
. 
from 
my 
cabinets 
i 
grabbed ScrEv_get_ingredients
out 
the 
flour 
, 
sugar 
and 
other 
dry 
ingredients 
that 
the 
recipe 
called 
for 
and 
measured ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
them 
out 
by 
using RelNScrEv_cake
my 
food 
scale 
. 
i 
grabbed ScrEv_get_ingredients
some 
eggs 
and 
butter 
out 
the 
fridge 
too 
. 
then 
i 
followed+along UnrelEv_cake
with 
the 
recipe 
and 
added ScrEv_add_ingredients
the 
ingredients 
, 
in 
order 
, 
to 
my 
mixer 
. 
i 
turned ScrEv_other_cake
it 
on 
its 
lowest 
setting 
and 
let UnrelEv_cake
it 
all 
mix ScrEv_make_dough
until 
it 
was 
well 
blended RelNScrEv_cake
. 
i 
next 
took+out ScrEv_take_out_cake_tin
the 
proper 
sized UnrelEv_cake
pan 
and 
greased ScrEv_grease_cake_tin
it 
with 
the 
butter 
wrapper 
. 
then 
i 
turned+off ScrEv_other_cake
the 
mixer 
and 
slowly 
added ScrEv_add_ingredients
the 
batter 
to 
my 
pan 
. 
the 
whole 
thing 
went ScrEv_put_cake_oven
in 
the 
preheated RelNScrEv_cake
over 
and 
i 
set ScrEv_set_time
a 
timer 
. 
when 
it 
went+off ScrEv_other_cake
later 
, 
i 
poked ScrEv_check
the 
cake 
with 
a 
toothpick 
and 
it 
came+out RelNScrEv_cake
clean 
, 
so 
that 
meant UnrelEv_cake
that 
the 
cake 
was 
done UnrelEv_cake
. 
i 
pulled ScrEv_take_out_oven
it 
out 
and 
set ScrEv_other_cake
it 
out 
to 
cool ScrEv_cool_down
for 
a 
while 
. 
later 
in 
the 
evening 
, 
i 
used ScrEv_add_ingredients
premade 
frosting 
, 
since 
that 
's 
what 
my 
friend 
likes 
the 
most 
, 
and 
frosted ScrEv_decorate
the 
cake 
. 
it 
came+out+looking UnrelEv_cake
pretty 
good 
. 
<end_of_story>_cake 
yesterday 
, 
i 
decided UnrelEv_cake
to 
bake+a+simple+white+cake Evoking_cake
for 
my 
friend 
's 
birthday 
. 
i 
went RelNScrEv_cake
the 
store 
to 
purchase ScrEv_get_ingredients
all 
the 
ingredients 
i 
would 
need+: RelNScrEv_cake
sugar 
, 
butter 
, 
eggs 
, 
all-purpose 
flour 
, 
baking 
soda 
, 
milk 
and 
vanilla 
extract 
for 
the 
cake 
, 
along 
with 
powdered UnrelEv_cake
sugar 
to 
make ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
a 
basic 
vanilla 
frosting 
. 
once 
i 
arrived RelNScrEv_cake
home 
, 
i 
preheat ScrEv_preheat
my 
oven 
to 
523 
degrees 
. 
i 
measured ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
the 
amount 
of 
each 
ingredient 
i 
would 
need RelNScrEv_cake
. 
in 
my 
mixer 
, 
i 
combined ScrEv_make_dough
all 
of 
the 
cake 
ingredients 
to 
form ScrEv_make_dough
a 
smooth 
batter 
. 
i 
poured ScrEv_pour_dough
the 
batter 
into 
a 
pan 
that 
was 
coated ScrEv_grease_cake_tin
with 
cooking 
spray 
. 
i 
baked RelNScrEv_cake
the 
cake 
for 
523 
minutes 
and 
turned+off ScrEv_turn_off_oven
the 
oven 
. 
i 
let UnrelEv_cake
the 
cake 
cool ScrEv_cool_down
for 
several 
hours 
. 
while 
waiting ScrEv_wait
, 
i 
used+powdered UnrelEv_cake
sugar 
, 
butter 
, 
milk 
and 
vanilla 
to 
make ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
the 
vanilla 
frosting 
. 
once 
the 
cake 
had 
cooked RelNScrEv_cake
, 
i 
decorated ScrEv_decorate
it 
with 
the 
frosting 
. 
i 
decided UnrelEv_cake
to 
add+a ScrEv_decorate
couple 
strawberries 
on 
top 
to 
make UnrelEv_cake
the 
cake 
look UnrelEv_cake
nicer 
. 
<end_of_story>_cake 
i 
decided UnrelEv_cake
to 
bake+a+cake Evoking_cake
the 
other 
day 
. 
i 
took ScrEv_other_cake
a 
look 
around 
my 
kitchen 
and 
i 
had UnrelEv_cake
everything 
i 
needed RelNScrEv_cake
, 
so 
i 
did 
n't 
need UnrelEv_cake
to 
go RelNScrEv_cake
to 
the 
store 
. 
i 
pulled ScrEv_choose_recipe
up 
a 
recipe 
on 
my 
tablet 
and 
started UnrelEv_cake
collecting ScrEv_get_ingredients
all 
the 
ingredients 
. 
once 
i 
had UnrelEv_cake
everything 
on 
the 
counter 
, 
i 
looked+at ScrEv_other_cake
what 
measures 
i 
would 
need UnrelEv_cake
and 
got+out ScrEv_get_utensils
the 
cups 
and 
teaspoons 
and 
all 
the 
bowls 
i 
'd 
need 
to 
mix RelNScrEv_cake
it 
in 
. 
i 
started UnrelEv_cake
by 
measuring ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
out 
the 
dry 
ingredients 
like 
flour 
and 
sugar 
and 
put ScrEv_add_ingredients
them 
in 
the 
bowl 
. 
then 
i 
added ScrEv_add_ingredients
things 
like 
the 
eggs 
and 
milk 
and 
mixed ScrEv_make_dough
it 
all 
up 
using UnrelEv_cake
my 
electric 
mixer 
. 
about 
halfway 
through 
i 
turned ScrEv_preheat
the 
oven 
on 
to 
preheat ScrEv_preheat
. 
i 
finished UnrelEv_cake
mixing ScrEv_make_dough
everything 
and 
got ScrEv_pour_dough
it 
into 
the 
cake 
pan 
. 
i 
set ScrEv_set_time
a 
timer 
and 
stated+putting UnrelEv_cake
the 
dirty 
dished 
in 
the 
sink 
to 
wash ScrEv_other_cake
. 
i 
decided+that UnrelEv_cake
they 
would 
keep UnrelEv_cake
for 
a 
little 
while 
and 
waited ScrEv_wait
until 
later 
that 
night 
. 
when 
the 
cake 
was 
done UnrelEv_cake
i 
let UnrelEv_cake
it 
cool+off ScrEv_cool_down
and 
put ScrEv_decorate
chocolate 
frosting 
on 
it 
. 
everyone 
agreed UnrelEv_cake
it 
was UnrelEv_cake
a 
really 
good 
cake 
, 
and 
washing RelNScrEv_cake
the 
dishes 
was UnrelEv_cake
n't 
that 
hard 
. 
i 
think UnrelEv_cake
i 
'll 
bake RelNScrEv_cake
a 
little 
more 
often 
. 
<end_of_story>_cake 
today 
, 
in 
rich 
's 
kitchen 
we 
'll 
learn UnrelEv_cake
about 
the 
fine 
attributes 
of 
baking+a+cake Evoking_cake
. 
since 
i 
am UnrelEv_cake
not 
a 
phenomenal 
baker 
we 
will 
be 
assisted UnrelEv_cake
by 
the 
use 
of 
little 
debbie 
in 
using RelNScrEv_cake
one 
of 
their 
fine 
cake 
mixes 
. 
in 
order 
to 
properly 
make+this+cake Evoking_cake
we 
will 
need RelNScrEv_cake
some 
vegetable 
oil 
and 
a 
couple 
of 
eggs 
. 
first 
thing 
to 
do UnrelEv_cake
is 
pre-heat ScrEv_preheat
our 
oven 
to 
the 
time 
listed UnrelEv_cake
on 
the 
box 
. 
then 
we 
will 
gather ScrEv_get_ingredients
the 
vegetable 
oil 
and 
eggs 
along 
with 
two 
round 
baking 
dishes 
and 
a 
bowl 
for 
mixing RelNScrEv_cake
. 
use ScrEv_grease_cake_tin
a 
cooking 
spray 
on 
your 
two 
round 
baking RelNScrEv_cake
dishes 
to 
prevent UnrelEv_cake
sticking RelNScrEv_cake
. 
next 
we 
will 
combine ScrEv_add_ingredients
the 
cake 
mix 
, 
vegetable 
oil 
, 
eggs 
and 
a 
little 
tap 
water 
and 
begin 
to 
mix ScrEv_make_dough
. 
once 
we 
have RelNScrEv_cake
the 
consistency 
we 
are 
looking+for UnrelEv_cake
pour ScrEv_pour_dough
the 
mix 
evenly 
in 
both 
baking RelNScrEv_cake
round 
dishes 
and 
put ScrEv_put_cake_oven
them 
into 
the 
oven 
for 
the 
time 
suggested UnrelEv_cake
on 
the 
box 
. 
make 
sure 
to 
taste ScrEv_other_cake
your 
cake 
mix 
for 
extra 
delicious 
value 
. 
while 
the 
cake 
is 
baking RelNScrEv_cake
clean+up ScrEv_other_cake
the 
mess 
. 
once 
baking RelNScrEv_cake
has 
completed+let UnrelEv_cake
the 
cake 
cool ScrEv_cool_down
and 
then 
you 
can 
remove ScrEv_take_out_cake_tin
the 
cakes 
and 
frost ScrEv_decorate
it 
with 
your 
favorite 
frosting 
. 
<end_of_story>_cake 
when 
i 
bake+a+cake Evoking_cake
, 
it 
is UnrelEv_cake
usually 
for 
a 
birthday 
. 
when 
i 
am 
baking+a+cake Evoking_cake
, 
i 
find ScrEv_choose_recipe
a 
good 
recipe 
online 
with 
good 
reviews 
and 
make+sure UnrelEv_cake
that 
i 
have RelNScrEv_cake
all 
of 
the 
ingredients 
needed UnrelEv_cake
. 
i 
take ScrEv_get_ingredients
all 
of 
the 
ingredients 
out 
and 
then 
i 
preheat ScrEv_preheat
the 
oven 
. 
i 
find ScrEv_get_utensils
the 
appropriate 
pans 
needed UnrelEv_cake
and 
make+sure RelNScrEv_cake
they 
are UnrelEv_cake
clean 
. 
then 
i 
grease ScrEv_grease_cake_tin
and 
flour ScrEv_other_cake
the 
pans 
and 
add ScrEv_other_cake
parchment 
paper 
to 
the 
bottom 
. 
next 
, 
i 
will 
measure ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
and 
combine ScrEv_make_dough
all 
of 
the 
dry 
ingredients 
, 
sifting RelNScrEv_cake
if 
necessary 
. 
then 
i 
combine ScrEv_make_dough
the 
wet 
ingredients 
after 
measuring ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
them 
and 
wisk RelNScrEv_cake
together 
. 
lastly 
, 
i 
combine ScrEv_make_dough
the 
wet 
and 
dry 
gently 
and 
stir ScrEv_other_cake
as 
little 
as 
possible 
before 
pouring ScrEv_pour_dough
into 
the 
pans 
and 
placing ScrEv_put_cake_oven
into 
the 
oven 
, 
taking ScrEv_set_time
note 
of 
the 
time 
i 
need 
to 
take ScrEv_take_out_oven
them 
back 
out 
. 
once 
baked RelNScrEv_cake
, 
i 
will 
cool ScrEv_cool_down
the 
cakes 
and 
frost ScrEv_decorate
, 
either 
with 
canned 
frosting 
or 
homemade 
frosting 
. 
at 
the 
very 
end 
i 
will 
decorate ScrEv_decorate
the 
cake 
since 
it 
is UnrelEv_cake
probably 
for 
a 
birthday 
. 
<end_of_story>_cake 
today 
i 
decided UnrelEv_cake
to 
bake+a+cake Evoking_cake
for 
my 
daughter 
's 
birthday 
. 
i 
knew UnrelEv_cake
she 
would 
want UnrelEv_cake
a 
chocolate 
cake 
, 
so 
i 
went RelNScrEv_cake
to 
the 
store 
to 
purchase ScrEv_get_ingredients
ingredients 
. 
i 
bought ScrEv_get_ingredients
cake 
mix 
and 
frosting 
, 
as 
well 
as 
ingredients 
necessary 
to 
make+the+cake Evoking_cake
such 
as 
eggs 
and 
oil 
. 
i 
came RelNScrEv_cake
home 
and 
made+sure ScrEv_other_cake
that 
my 
kitchen 
was UnrelEv_cake
clean 
and 
ready 
to 
bake RelNScrEv_cake
in 
. 
i 
set UnrelEv_cake
the 
oven 
to 
preheat ScrEv_preheat
and 
went+about UnrelEv_cake
mixing+up ScrEv_make_dough
the 
cake 
batter 
. 
while 
the 
oven 
was 
preheating ScrEv_preheat
, 
i 
greased ScrEv_grease_cake_tin
and 
floured ScrEv_other_cake
a 
cake 
pan 
and 
dumped ScrEv_pour_dough
the 
batter 
into 
it 
. 
finally 
, 
the 
oven 
beeped ScrEv_other_cake
which 
signaled UnrelEv_cake
that 
it 
was 
ready 
. 
i 
placed ScrEv_put_cake_oven
the 
cake 
on 
the 
middle 
rack 
in 
the 
oven 
and 
shut ScrEv_other_cake
the 
oven 
door 
. 
i 
checked ScrEv_other_cake
the 
back 
of 
the 
cake 
mix 
box 
to 
see 
timing 
instructions 
for 
the 
pan 
size 
i 
chose UnrelEv_cake
, 
and 
set ScrEv_set_time
the 
built-in 
timer 
on 
my 
oven 
accordingly 
. 
while 
the 
cake 
was 
baking RelNScrEv_cake
, 
i 
cleaned+up ScrEv_other_cake
my 
mess 
. 
i 
wiped+down ScrEv_other_cake
the 
counters 
, 
put ScrEv_other_cake
the 
mixer 
away 
, 
and 
loaded ScrEv_other_cake
the 
dishwasher 
. 
once 
the 
timer 
went+off ScrEv_other_cake
, 
i 
removed ScrEv_take_out_oven
the 
cake 
from 
the 
oven 
and 
set UnrelEv_cake
it 
aside 
to 
cool ScrEv_cool_down
. 
once 
it 
was UnrelEv_cake
cool 
, 
i 
frosted ScrEv_decorate
and 
decorated ScrEv_decorate
it 
. 
that 
's 
how 
i 
baked+my+cake Evoking_cake
. 
<end_of_story>_cake 
i 
am UnrelEv_cake
more 
of 
a 
cook 
rather 
than 
a 
baker Evoking_cake
of 
pastries 
and 
sweets 
. 
but 
with 
the 
internet 
and 
youtube 
anything 
can 
be 
found UnrelEv_cake
. 
i 
searched UnrelEv_cake
youtube 
to 
find ScrEv_choose_recipe
a 
good 
simple 
but 
interesting 
set 
of 
instructions 
. 
i 
decided+on+a+chocolate+cake Evoking_cake
as 
i 
am UnrelEv_cake
weak 
when 
it 
comes+to+resisting UnrelEv_cake
chocolate 
. 
i 
gathered ScrEv_get_ingredients
all 
of 
the 
ingredients 
and 
placed ScrEv_get_utensils
them 
on 
the 
counter 
along 
with 
measuring 
cups 
and 
spoons 
. 
i 
could 
not 
believe UnrelEv_cake
how 
much 
sugar 
goes 
into 
the 
baking+of+a+cake Evoking_cake
but 
that 
's UnrelEv_cake
why 
it 
's UnrelEv_cake
not 
a 
health 
food 
. 
all 
the 
ingredients 
went ScrEv_add_ingredients
into 
a 
bowl 
for 
me 
to 
mix ScrEv_make_dough
with 
a 
523 
's 
hand 
held 
electric 
mixer 
. 
while 
the 
over 
was 
preheating ScrEv_preheat
i 
scooped ScrEv_pour_dough
a 
the 
mixture 
into 
a 
well 
greased ScrEv_grease_cake_tin
baking 
pan 
. 
naturally 
my 
finger 
stole ScrEv_eat
a 
taste 
of 
the 
raw 
cake 
. 
after 
placing ScrEv_put_cake_oven
the 
bowl 
in 
the 
oven 
and 
and 
waiting ScrEv_wait
the 
proper 
time 
i 
removed ScrEv_take_out_oven
the 
cake 
and 
frosted ScrEv_decorate
it 
after 
it 
cooled ScrEv_cool_down
down 
. 
not 
too 
bad 
for 
a 
non 
baker 
but 
i 
'll 
stick UnrelEv_cake
to 
cooking UnrelEv_cake
. 
<end_of_story>_cake 
being UnrelEv_cake
pregnant 
with 
my 
first 
child 
all 
i 
ever 
craved UnrelEv_cake
was 
chocolate 
cake 
. 
every 
time 
i 
went UnrelEv_cake
outside 
i 
had 
to 
find UnrelEv_cake
somewhere 
to 
buy UnrelEv_cake
one 
. 
i 
was UnrelEv_cake
truly 
a 
chocolate 
cake 
addict 
but 
had UnrelEv_cake
no 
clue 
how 
to 
bake+a+cake Evoking_cake
. 
i 
decided UnrelEv_cake
to 
buy ScrEv_get_ingredients
one 
from 
the 
supermarket 
out 
of 
the 
box 
. 
the 
recipe 
called+for UnrelEv_cake
me 
to 
have RelNScrEv_cake
water 
, 
oil 
and 
eggs 
which 
i 
had UnrelEv_cake
at 
home 
. 
in 
a 
rush 
i 
quickly 
read ScrEv_other_cake
the 
directions 
and 
preheat ScrEv_preheat
my 
oven 
to 
523 
degrees 
. 
i 
poured ScrEv_add_ingredients
the 
eggs 
, 
water 
, 
oil 
and 
cake 
mix 
in 
the 
box 
and 
beat ScrEv_make_dough
it 
with 
my 
hand 
blender 
for 
about 
a 
minute 
. 
the 
smell 
of 
the 
gooey 
chocolate 
in 
the 
bowl 
make UnrelEv_cake
my 
little 
bundle 
of 
joy 
inside 
me 
kick UnrelEv_cake
for 
joy 
. 
when 
i 
was 
pouring ScrEv_pour_dough
it 
into 
the 
pan 
to 
bake RelNScrEv_cake
it 
was UnrelEv_cake
hard 
to 
resist UnrelEv_cake
temptation 
of 
a 
taste 
. 
but 
knowing UnrelEv_cake
that 
raw 
eggs 
are UnrelEv_cake
unhealthy 
i 
decided UnrelEv_cake
to 
to ScrEv_wait
the 
twenty 
five 
minutes 
until 
it 
was 
done RelNScrEv_cake
. 
when 
my 
timer 
went+off ScrEv_other_cake
i 
removed ScrEv_take_out_oven
it 
from 
the 
oven 
and 
tried ScrEv_eat
a 
small 
piece 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_cake
one 
of 
the 
most 
moist 
and 
delicious 
cakes 
i 
ever 
had ScrEv_eat
. 
<end_of_story>_cake 
i 
decided UnrelEv_cake
to 
bake+a+cake Evoking_cake
for 
my 
daughter 
's 
birthday 
. 
i 
had 
gone RelNScrEv_cake
to 
the 
grocery 
store 
to 
buy UnrelEv_cake
one 
, 
but 
nothing 
looked UnrelEv_cake
very 
good 
and 
they 
were UnrelEv_cake
really 
expensive 
for 
what 
i 
was 
getting UnrelEv_cake
. 
i 
figured UnrelEv_cake
that 
i 
could 
make+a+better+cake Evoking_cake
myself 
. 
i 
figured UnrelEv_cake
that 
i 
have 
seen UnrelEv_cake
cooking 
shows 
and 
said UnrelEv_cake
, 
'' 
`` 
how 
hard 
could 
it 
be UnrelEv_cake
? 
'' 
'' 
i 
bought ScrEv_get_ingredients
a 
betty 
crocker 
triple 
chocolate 
fudge 
cake 
mix 
and 
i 
thought UnrelEv_cake
it 
looked UnrelEv_cake
pretty 
good 
. 
i 
went UnrelEv_cake
to 
the 
frosting 
and 
found ScrEv_get_ingredients
some 
oreo 
frosting 
mix 
and 
thought UnrelEv_cake
it 
would 
be UnrelEv_cake
perfect 
because 
my 
daughter 
loves UnrelEv_cake
oreo 
cookies 
. 
then 
, 
i 
grabbed ScrEv_get_ingredients
a 
box 
of 
oreo 
cookies 
, 
some 
eggs 
, 
milk 
, 
and 
some 
oil 
. 
i 
did 
not 
know UnrelEv_cake
if 
i 
had UnrelEv_cake
all 
of 
that 
at 
home 
, 
but 
i 
figured UnrelEv_cake
they 
would 
not 
go UnrelEv_cake
to 
waste 
. 
i 
came ScrEv_other_cake
home 
and 
mixed ScrEv_make_dough
everything 
and 
put ScrEv_put_cake_oven
it 
in 
the 
oven 
. 
i 
tested ScrEv_check
the 
cake 
before 
taking ScrEv_take_out_oven
it 
out 
of 
the 
oven 
with 
a 
toothpick 
. 
coming+out RelNScrEv_cake
clean 
, 
i 
decided UnrelEv_cake
the 
cake 
was 
done RelNScrEv_cake
. 
i 
had 
pour ScrEv_pour_dough
the 
cake 
mix 
into 
two 
baking RelNScrEv_cake
pans 
because 
my 
plan 
was UnrelEv_cake
to 
make 
a 
two 
layered RelNScrEv_cake
cake 
. 
i 
saw 
on 
a 
cooking 
show 
that 
you 
are 
supposed+to UnrelEv_cake
cut RelNScrEv_cake
the 
top 
of 
one 
of 
the 
cakes 
so 
that 
the 
top 
was UnrelEv_cake
flat 
. 
i 
managed+to UnrelEv_cake
do ScrEv_other_cake
that 
pretty 
well 
and 
i 
ate ScrEv_eat
the 
cake 
with 
some 
milk 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_cake
pretty 
tasty 
. 
so 
, 
next 
, 
i 
got ScrEv_get_ingredients
the 
frosting 
and 
put ScrEv_decorate
it 
on 
the 
first 
layer 
, 
and 
then 
on 
the 
second 
. 
i 
thought 
it 
looked UnrelEv_cake
pretty 
good 
. 
i 
carefully 
chopped ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
some 
oreos 
up 
and 
sprinkled ScrEv_decorate
them 
on 
the 
top 
of 
the 
cake 
. 
to 
further 
top RelNScrEv_cake
it 
off 
, 
i 
cut ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
a 
few 
cookies 
in 
half 
and 
stuck ScrEv_decorate
them 
pointing+up UnrelEv_cake
in 
a 
circle 
around 
the 
outside 
of 
the 
cake 
. 
it 
looked UnrelEv_cake
really 
good 
. 
my 
wife 
was UnrelEv_cake
really 
surprised UnrelEv_cake
that 
i 
had 
made RelNScrEv_cake
it 
myself 
. 
my 
daughter 
was UnrelEv_cake
really 
happy 
and 
everyone 
liked UnrelEv_cake
the 
cake 
. 
<end_of_story>_cake 
last 
night 
, 
i 
had 
to 
bake+a+cake Evoking_cake
for 
my 
son 
's 
birthday 
party 
. 
i 
decided UnrelEv_cake
to 
go RelNScrEv_cake
online 
to 
find ScrEv_choose_recipe
a 
recipe 
to 
follow RelNScrEv_cake
that 
a 
lot 
of 
people 
seemed UnrelEv_cake
to 
like UnrelEv_cake
. 
i 
found ScrEv_choose_recipe
a 
great 
chocolate 
cake 
recipe 
and 
printed UnrelEv_cake
it 
out 
. 
once 
it 
was 
done UnrelEv_cake
being 
printed UnrelEv_cake
, 
i 
brought RelNScrEv_cake
it 
into 
the 
kitchen 
and 
started UnrelEv_cake
gathering ScrEv_get_ingredients
supplies 
. 
among 
the 
supplies 
were UnrelEv_cake
eggs 
, 
flour 
, 
sugar 
, 
and 
more 
. 
first 
thing 
's 
first 
: 
i 
had 
to 
set ScrEv_preheat
the 
oven 
for 
523 
degrees 
. 
the 
best 
way 
to 
follow RelNScrEv_cake
a 
baking RelNScrEv_cake
recipe 
is 
by 
adding ScrEv_add_ingredients
the 
dry 
ingredients 
like 
flour 
and 
baking 
powder 
together 
first 
. 
once 
those 
are 
mixed ScrEv_make_dough
together 
, 
the 
wet 
ingredients 
are 
mixed ScrEv_make_dough
together 
and 
added ScrEv_add_ingredients
to 
the 
dry 
ingredients 
. 
i 
followed RelNScrEv_cake
the 
measurements 
in 
the 
recipe 
and 
mixed ScrEv_make_dough
together 
the 
cake 
batter 
. 
i 
grabbed ScrEv_get_utensils
a 
rectangle 
cake 
pan 
, 
oiled ScrEv_grease_cake_tin
it 
and 
shook ScrEv_other_cake
some 
flour 
around 
the 
edges 
. 
i 
poured ScrEv_pour_dough
the 
cake 
into 
the 
pan 
and 
put ScrEv_put_cake_oven
it 
into 
the 
oven 
for 
about 
523 
minutes 
. 
when 
i 
thought UnrelEv_cake
it 
was 
done RelNScrEv_cake
, 
i 
checked ScrEv_check
the 
cake 
with 
a 
toothpick 
by 
putting UnrelEv_cake
it 
in 
the 
middle 
. 
the 
toothpick 
came+out RelNScrEv_cake
clean 
, 
without 
any 
batter 
on 
it 
, 
so 
i 
knew UnrelEv_cake
the 
cake 
was 
done RelNScrEv_cake
. 
i 
let UnrelEv_cake
it 
cool ScrEv_cool_down
for 
a 
few 
hours 
, 
added ScrEv_decorate
icing 
, 
and 
enjoyed ScrEv_eat
it 
at 
the 
birthday 
party 
.

<end_of_story>_cake

male 
i 
never 
envisioned UnrelEv_cake
myself 
baking+a+cake Evoking_cake
. 
of

i 
also 
did 
n't

whom 
preferred UnrelEv_cake
homemade 
gifts 
over 
anything 
else 
.

get ScrEv_get_ingredients
what 
i 
need

the 
first 
thing 
i 
get ScrEv_get_ingredients
is 
the 
cake 
mix 
, 
then 
i 
use RelNScrEv_cake
it 
to 
figure+out UnrelEv_cake
what 
exactly 
it 
is UnrelEv_cake
that 
i 
need UnrelEv_cake
for

<end_of_story>_cake 
last 
weekend 
my 
girlfriend 
and 
i 
decided UnrelEv_cake
we 
would 
like UnrelEv_cake
to 
make+a+special+treat Evoking_cake
for 
sunday 
dinner 
with 
our 
families 
. 
we 
decided UnrelEv_cake
we 
would 
make+a+special+dessert Evoking_cake
to 
have ScrEv_eat
after 
the 
meal 
. 
we 
went RelNScrEv_cake
to 
the 
grocery 
store 
to 
get 
some 
of 
the 
ingredients 
we 
thought 
we 
would 
need 
. 
once 
at 
the 
grocery 
store 
we 
chose RelNScrEv_cake
the 
dessert 
we 
were 
going 
to 
serve RelNScrEv_cake
as 
a 
treat 
for 
our 
guests 
. 
we 
picked ScrEv_get_ingredients
up 
flour 
, 
sugar 
, 
and 
several 
other 
ingredients 
needed 
to 
bake+a+cake Evoking_cake
. 
once 
we 
returned UnrelEv_cake
home 
we 
started UnrelEv_cake
to 
mix ScrEv_make_dough
together 
a 
batter 
for 
our 
cake 
. 
once 
the 
batter 
was UnrelEv_cake
just 
right 
we 
evenly 
spread ScrEv_pour_dough
it 
in 
a 
pan 
and 
placed ScrEv_put_cake_oven
it 
in 
the 
oven 
. 
after 
some 
time 
in 
the 
oven 
to 
bake RelNScrEv_cake
our 
cake 
was UnrelEv_cake
ready 
to 
take+out ScrEv_take_out_oven
so 
we 
could 
add ScrEv_add_ingredients
frosting 
. 
after 
the 
cake 
cooled ScrEv_cool_down
we 
added ScrEv_add_ingredients
the 
frosting 
and 
set ScrEv_other_cake
it 
aside 
to 
wait ScrEv_wait
for 
our 
guests 
to

some 
sprinkles 
on 
the 
top 
to 
make UnrelEv_cake

look UnrelEv_cake
nice 
. 
i 
then 
put ScrEv_other_cake
it 
in 
the 
fridge 
to 
save RelNScrEv_cake
for 
my 
grandmother 
. 
<end_of_story>_cake 
this 
weekend 
, 
i 
decided UnrelEv_cake
i 
wanted UnrelEv_cake
to 
try UnrelEv_cake
baking+my+first+cake Evoking_cake
. 
i 
found ScrEv_choose_recipe
a 
recipe 
online 
for 
an 
easy 
to 
make RelNScrEv_cake
cake 
, 
printed+out RelNScrEv_cake
a 
list 
of 
the 
ingredients 
, 
and 
went ScrEv_other_cake
to 
the 
grocery 
store 
to 
get ScrEv_get_ingredients
them 
. 
i 
knew UnrelEv_cake
about 
some 
of 
the 
common 
things 
, 
like 
eggs 
, 
flour 
, 
and 
sugar 
, 
but 
the 
list 
helped UnrelEv_cake
me 
get ScrEv_get_ingredients
a 
lot 
of 
things 
i 
did 
n't 
own UnrelEv_cake
and 
would 
n't 
know UnrelEv_cake
to 
get UnrelEv_cake
. 
when 
i 
got RelNScrEv_cake
home 
, 
i 
followed RelNScrEv_cake
the 
recipe 
as 
closely 
as 
i 
could 
, 
adding ScrEv_add_ingredients
each 
of 
the 
ingredients 
at 
the 
exact 
amount 
of 
the 
recipe 
asked+for UnrelEv_cake
. 
i 
mixed ScrEv_make_dough
them 
all 
up 
as 
described UnrelEv_cake
, 
and 
put ScrEv_pour_dough
them 
into 
a 
pan 
that 
i 
had 
borrowed UnrelEv_cake
from 
my 
mother 
. 
i 
put ScrEv_put_cake_oven
the 
pan 
in 
the 
oven 
and 
let UnrelEv_cake
the 
cake 
cook RelNScrEv_cake
. 
i 
checked+on ScrEv_check
it 
occasionally 
to 
see UnrelEv_cake
if 
it 
was 
looking UnrelEv_cake
ok 
, 
and 
because 
i 
was UnrelEv_cake
really 
excited UnrelEv_cake
to 
see UnrelEv_cake
how 
it 
was 
turning+out UnrelEv_cake
. 
when 
it 
was 
done UnrelEv_cake
in 
the 
oven 
i 
removed ScrEv_take_out_oven
it 
, 
and 
applied ScrEv_decorate
an 
extra 
thick 
coat 
of 
frosting 
. 
i 
was+supposed+to UnrelEv_cake
wait ScrEv_wait
for 
the 
cake 
to 
cook RelNScrEv_cake
, 
but 
i 
was UnrelEv_cake
too 
excited 
to 
try UnrelEv_cake
it 
out 
and 
ate ScrEv_eat
it 
much 
sooner 
than 
recommended UnrelEv_cake
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_cake
delicious 
! 
<end_of_story>_cake 
when 
i 
baked+a+cake Evoking_cake
, 
i 
got ScrEv_get_utensils
my 
dishes 
out 
from 
the 
cupboard 
in 
my 
kitchen 
. 
i 
laid+out ScrEv_other_cake
all 
the 
dishes 
and 
ingredients 
needed UnrelEv_cake
to 
bake+my+cake Evoking_cake
. 
after 
preheating UnrelEv_cake
the 
dishes 
and 
preheating ScrEv_preheat
the 
oven 
to 
a 
set UnrelEv_cake
temperature 
, 
i 
started UnrelEv_cake
on 
making ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
my 
frosting 
. 
i 
broke ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
the 
eggs 
and 
separated ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
the 
yolks 
and 
the 
whites 
, 
and 
i 
set ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
up 
my 
flour 
in 
my 
pans 
. 
i 
then 
went+on UnrelEv_cake
to 
making ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
and 
mixing ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
my 
frosting 
and 
my 
batter 
in 
their 
respective 
bowls 
. 
the 
batter 
was 
finished ScrEv_make_dough
and 
then 
placed ScrEv_pour_dough
into 
the 
baking 
pan 
for 
about 
the 
next 
half 
hour 
. 
after 
the 
oven 
timer 
went+off ScrEv_other_cake
, 
i 
checked ScrEv_check
on 
the 
way 
the 
batter 
had 
risen RelNScrEv_cake
and 
settled RelNScrEv_cake
, 
and 
found UnrelEv_cake
that 
my 
cake 
was UnrelEv_cake
ready 
to 
be 
decorated ScrEv_decorate
with 
the 
frosting 
. 
this 
was 
meant UnrelEv_cake
to 
be UnrelEv_cake
a 
birthday 
cake 
, 
so 
i 
bought ScrEv_get_ingredients
festive 
frosting 
add-ons 
to 
go UnrelEv_cake
with 
my 
original 
homemade UnrelEv_cake
frosting 
. 
i 
applied ScrEv_decorate
the 
homemade UnrelEv_cake
frosting 
to 
the 
cake 
first 
, 
then 
squirted ScrEv_decorate
the 
store-bought UnrelEv_cake
frosting 
onto 
the 
cake 
through 
the 
funnel 
. 
i 
wrote ScrEv_decorate
several 
words 
on 
the 
cake 
as 
well 
to 
make UnrelEv_cake
it 
more 
personalized UnrelEv_cake
for 
the 
person 
whom 
the 
birthday 
was 
happening UnrelEv_cake
for 
. 
i 
also 
set+aside UnrelEv_cake
several 
candles 
for 
the 
birthday 
boy 
to 
blow+out UnrelEv_cake
later 
on 
.

so 
, 
first 
i 
went UnrelEv_cake

to 
get ScrEv_get_ingredients
the 
necessary

spread+out ScrEv_other_cake
all 
the 
ingredients 
on 
the

i 
mixed ScrEv_prepare_ingredients

i 
took ScrEv_add_ingredients
all 
the 
eggs 
and 
liquid 
ingredients 
and 
blended ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
them 
in 
another 
bowl 
. 
then 
i 
took ScrEv_get_utensils

bowls 
and 
blended ScrEv_make_dough

then 
i 
preheated ScrEv_preheat
the

and 
put ScrEv_pour_dough
the 
mixture 
in 
a 
glass 
pan 
with 
a 
buttered RelNScrEv_cake
bottom 
. 
then 
i 
baked RelNScrEv_cake
it 
. 
<end_of_story>_cake 
for 
my 
sons 
birthday 
we 
decided UnrelEv_cake
to 
cut UnrelEv_cake
costs 
in 
order 
to 
splurge UnrelEv_cake
on 
more 
expensive 
electronic 
gifts 
by

just 
some 
of 
the 
decisions 
i 
was 
faced UnrelEv_cake
with 
. 
we 
chose UnrelEv_cake

my 
recipie 
i 
headed ScrEv_other_cake

my 
list 
of

did 
not 
have RelNScrEv_cake

of 
$ 
523 
, 
not

smelled UnrelEv_cake
of

delicious 
fall 
afternoon

cinnamon 
bringing UnrelEv_cake
all 
the 
kids 
out 
of 
the

<end_of_story>_cake 
one 
day 
, 
a 
friend 
and 
i 
decided UnrelEv_cake
to 
bake+a+cake Evoking_cake
. 
we 
first 
looked+up ScrEv_choose_recipe
ingredients 
online 
to 
make RelNScrEv_cake
the 
type 
of 
cake 
we 
wanted UnrelEv_cake
. 
then 
we 
went ScrEv_other_cake
to 
the 
supermarket 
and 
bought ScrEv_get_ingredients
all 
of 
them 
. 
after 
bringing ScrEv_other_cake
all 
of 
our 
ingredients 
home 
, 
we 
followed RelNScrEv_cake
the 
recipe 
instructions 
closely 
to 
ensure UnrelEv_cake
we 
were 
not 
doing UnrelEv_cake
anything 
wrong 
. 
we 
put ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
our 
ingredients 
together 
to 
make+sure UnrelEv_cake
they 
were 
at 
the 
right 
temperature 
, 
preheated ScrEv_preheat
the 
oven 
, 
and 
pulled+out ScrEv_get_utensils
the 
proper 
utensils 
. 
we 
then 
prepared ScrEv_make_dough
the 
batter 
using UnrelEv_cake
eggs 
and 
some 
other 
materials 
we 
purchased UnrelEv_cake
and 
then 
poured ScrEv_pour_dough
them 
into 
a 
pan 
. 
we 
then 
put ScrEv_put_cake_oven
the 
pan 
in 
the 
oven 
and 
baked RelNScrEv_cake
it 
according 
to 
the 
instructions 
. 
after 
baking+the+cake Evoking_cake
in 
the 
oven 
for 
the 
time 
the 
recipe 
told UnrelEv_cake
us 
too 
, 
we 
then 
double 
checked ScrEv_check
to 
make+sure UnrelEv_cake
it 
was 
done UnrelEv_cake
by 
pushing ScrEv_check
a 
knife 
into 
the 
center 
. 
we 
saw UnrelEv_cake
some 
crumbs 
sticking 
to 
the 
knife 
when 
we 
pulled UnrelEv_cake
it 
out 
so 
we 
knew 
it 
was UnrelEv_cake
ready 
to 
eat ScrEv_eat
! 
<end_of_story>_cake 
me 
and 
my 
friend 
decided UnrelEv_cake
we 
would 
bake+a+cake Evoking_cake
for 
our 
best 
friends 
birthday 
as 
opposed UnrelEv_cake
to 
purchasing UnrelEv_cake
it 
from 
a 
bakery 
like 
we 
usually 
do UnrelEv_cake
. 
first 
we 
headed+out ScrEv_other_cake
to 
the 
grocery 
store 
to 
pick+up ScrEv_get_ingredients
our 
baking 
supplies 
. 
my 
friend 
took ScrEv_get_utensils
care 
of 
the 
appliances 
and 
pans 
while 
i 
handle ScrEv_get_ingredients
the 
flour 
, 
sugar 
, 
frosting 
, 
and 
eggs 
. 
when 
we 
arrived RelNScrEv_cake
home 
we 
cleaned ScrEv_other_cake
our 
utensils 
and 
began UnrelEv_cake
to 
bake+the+cake Evoking_cake
. 
first 
we 
started UnrelEv_cake
by 
pouring ScrEv_add_ingredients
the 
cake 
batter 
in 
the 
bowl 
and 
cracking ScrEv_add_ingredients
two 
eggs 
into 
the 
powder 
. 
next 
we 
beat ScrEv_make_dough
the 
mixture 
with 
a 
mixer 
until 
it 
was UnrelEv_cake
a 
creamy 
texture 
. 
we 
added ScrEv_add_ingredients
the 
sugar 
, 
the 
flour 
, 
and 
the 
chocolate 
for 
an 
extra 
boost 
of 
flavor 
. 
finally 
our 
cake 
was UnrelEv_cake
nice 
and 
mixed RelNScrEv_cake
so 
we 
set ScrEv_preheat
the 
oven 
to 
three 
hundred 
fifty 
degrees 
and 
baked RelNScrEv_cake
the 
cake 
. 
while 
the 
cake 
was 
baking RelNScrEv_cake
my 
friend 
prepared ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
the 
homemade RelNScrEv_cake
vanilla 
frosting 
. 
after 
an 
hour 
we 
took ScrEv_take_out_oven
the 
cake 
out 
of 
the 
oven 
and 
were 
met UnrelEv_cake
with 
an 
amazing 
aroma 
. 
we 
decorated ScrEv_decorate
the 
cake 
with 
our 
homemade RelNScrEv_cake
vanilla 
frosting 
and 
placed ScrEv_other_cake
the 
cake 
in 
a 
glass 
cover 
so 
that 
it 
would 
remain UnrelEv_cake
fresh 
for 
our 
friend 
that 
night 
. 
<end_of_story>_cake 
the 
easiest 
cake+for+me+to+make Evoking_cake
is 
cheesecake 
. 
throw ScrEv_add_ingredients
eggs 
, 
sugar 
, 
cream 
cheese 
and 
flavor 
in 
a 
bowl 
and 
you 
have UnrelEv_cake
the 
filling 
. 
pour ScrEv_pour_dough

filling 
in 
a 
cookie 
crust 
, 
bake RelNScrEv_cake
at 
523 
for 
one 
hour 
, 
remove ScrEv_take_out_oven
and 
freeze ScrEv_other_cake

a 
few 
strawberries 
, 
pour ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
sugar 
over 
them 
add ScrEv_prepare_ingredients
a

my 
love 
of 
cooking RelNScrEv_cake
came+from UnrelEv_cake
my 
mother 
. 
she 
used+let UnrelEv_cake
me 
help UnrelEv_cake
her 
in 
the 
kitchen 
. 
when 
she 
made RelNScrEv_cake
cakes 
and 
pies 
and 
used UnrelEv_cake
the 
mixer 
, 
she 
would 
let UnrelEv_cake
me 
lick RelNScrEv_cake
the 
bowl 
. 
i 
would 
get RelNScrEv_cake
frosting 
, 
cake 
batter 
and 
pie 
filling 
on 
my 
jaws 
and 
face 
. 
but 
i 
didn 
' 
t 
care UnrelEv_cake
about 
that 
. 
those 
times 
were UnrelEv_cake
the 
few 
times 
that 
my 
siblings 
and 
i 
didn 
' 
t 
complain UnrelEv_cake
about 
cleaning+up RelNScrEv_cake
the 
kitchen 
. 
i 
wish UnrelEv_cake
i 
could 
have UnrelEv_cake
a 
day 
like 
one 
of 
those 
days 
just 
once 
again 
.

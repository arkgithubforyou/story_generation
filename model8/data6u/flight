'' 
before 
you 
board+the+plane Evoking_flight
you 
should 
consider UnrelEv_flight
picking+up RelNScrEv_flight
a 
bottle 
of 
water 
and 
a 
snack 
in 
case 
they 
do 
n't 
have UnrelEv_flight
anything 
you 
'd 
like UnrelEv_flight
to 
drink ScrEv_spend_time_flight
or 
eat ScrEv_spend_time_flight
on 
the 
flight 
. 
you 
should 
also 
stop RelNScrEv_flight
at 
the 
restroom 
so 
, 
hopefully 
, 
you 
wo 
n't 
have 
to 
go RelNScrEv_flight
to 
the 
bathroom 
during 
the 
flight 
. 
if 
you 
have UnrelEv_flight
an 
assigned RelNScrEv_flight
seat 
for 
your 
flight 
do 
n't 
rush UnrelEv_flight
to 
get+on ScrEv_board_plane
because 
it 
'll 
just 
mean+sitting ScrEv_wait_boarding
there 
for 
a 
longer 
period 
of 
time 
. 
once 
you 
are UnrelEv_flight
ready 
to 
board ScrEv_board_plane
just 
be UnrelEv_flight
patient 
with 
everyone 
else 
who 
is 
flying RelNScrEv_flight
and 
with 
the 
flight 
attendants 
. 
once 
you 
have 
found ScrEv_take_seat
your 
seat 
store ScrEv_stow_away_luggage
any 
large 
items 
overhead 
and 
keep RelNScrEv_flight
whatever 
you 
might 
want UnrelEv_flight
during 
the 
flight 
in 
the 
seat-back 
. 
i 
suggest UnrelEv_flight
putting RelNScrEv_flight
your 
electronic 
devices 
there 
, 
headphones 
, 
books 
etc. 
. 
i 
also 
like UnrelEv_flight
to 
make+sure UnrelEv_flight
to 
have RelNScrEv_flight
gum 
, 
my 
snack 
and 
my 
water 
readily 
available 
. 
if 
you 
have UnrelEv_flight
a 
smaller 
item 
you 
can 
put RelNScrEv_flight
that 
underneath 
the 
seat 
in 
front 
of 
you 
. 
it 
is UnrelEv_flight
a 
good 
idea 
to 
chew ScrEv_other_flight
gum 
at 
least 
at 
the 
start 
of 
the 
flight 
so 
you 
avoid UnrelEv_flight
having 
your 
ears 
pop RelNScrEv_flight
. 
try 
to 
stay+hydrated UnrelEv_flight
during 
your 
flight 
, 
and 
keep RelNScrEv_flight
your 
seat-belt 
on 
whenever 
you 
are 
sitting+down UnrelEv_flight
. 
<end_of_story>_flight 
i 
was+excited UnrelEv_flight
to 
go UnrelEv_flight
home 
for 
the 
holidays 
last 
december 
, 
but 
i 
was 
less 
excited UnrelEv_flight
about 
having+to+take+an+airplane Evoking_flight
! 
i 
normally 
would 
drive UnrelEv_flight
, 
but 
my 
mother 
persuaded UnrelEv_flight
me 
to 
take+a+plane Evoking_flight
because 
she 
was UnrelEv_flight
afraid 
i 
would 
have 
to 
drive UnrelEv_flight
through 
snow 
. 
i 
filled ScrEv_pack_luggage
a 
single 
suitcase 
with 
as 
many 
necessities 
i 
could 
fit UnrelEv_flight
, 
because 
i 
did 
not 
want+to UnrelEv_flight
have 
to 
deal+with UnrelEv_flight
putting RelNScrEv_flight
multiple 
suitcases 
through 
the 
luggage 
handler 
. 
i 
arrived ScrEv_get_airport
at 
the 
airport 
and 
waited ScrEv_wait
in 
line 
to 
check+in ScrEv_check_in
. 
i 
let UnrelEv_flight
the 
tsa 
search+me ScrEv_go_security_checks
for 
any 
contraband 
that 
would 
not 
be 
allowed UnrelEv_flight
on 
the 
plane 
, 
and 
then 
waited ScrEv_wait_boarding
to 
be 
allowed UnrelEv_flight
to 
board ScrEv_board_plane
. 
once 
we 
were 
let+on ScrEv_board_plane
the 
plane 
, 
i 
walked+over ScrEv_take_seat
to 
my 
seat 
and 
shoved ScrEv_stow_away_luggage
my 
suitcase 
into 
the 
overhead 
compartment 
. 
luckily 
it 
fit RelNScrEv_flight
, 
so 
i 
would 
be UnrelEv_flight
able 
to 
keep RelNScrEv_flight
it 
with 
me 
. 
i 
snuggled RelNScrEv_flight
into 
my 
seat 
and 
tried UnrelEv_flight
to 
ignore UnrelEv_flight
the 
butterflies 
in 
my 
stomach 
. 
flying RelNScrEv_flight
always 
makes RelNScrEv_flight
me 
nervous 
. 
the 
person 
seated RelNScrEv_flight
directly 
next 
to 
me 
was 
a 
middle 
aged 
woman 
flying RelNScrEv_flight
alone 
. 
she 
gave UnrelEv_flight
me 
a 
sympathetic 
smile 
and 
asked UnrelEv_flight
me 
if 
i 
was UnrelEv_flight
as 
nervous 
as 
she 
was UnrelEv_flight
. 
i 
said UnrelEv_flight
yes 
, 
and 
i 
think UnrelEv_flight
we 
both 
felt UnrelEv_flight
better 
that 
at 
least 
we 
would 
be UnrelEv_flight
good 
seatmates 
. 
the 
plane 
ride 
was UnrelEv_flight
uneventful 
; 
after 
five 
hours 
in 
the 
air 
, 
we 
landed ScrEv_landing
at 
our 
destination 
in 
one 
piece 
. 
<end_of_story>_flight 
i 
flew Evoking_flight
to 
iceland 
one 
year 
on 
vacation 
. 
i 
left RelNScrEv_flight
jfk 
airport 
in 
new 
york 
and 
flew Evoking_flight
to 
keflavik 
in 
iceland 
. 
jfk 
is UnrelEv_flight
an 
enormous 
airport 
. 
i 
parked ScrEv_get_airport
in 
long 
term 
parking 
and 
then 
took ScrEv_other_flight
a 
shuttle 
to 
actual 
terminals 
. 
i 
felt UnrelEv_flight
so 
nervous 
that 
i 
would 
n't 
make RelNScrEv_flight
my 
flight 
! 
i 
was UnrelEv_flight
so 
afraid 
beforehand 
of 
getting UnrelEv_flight
my 
bag 
lost RelNScrEv_flight
that 
i 
just 
packed ScrEv_pack_luggage
everything 
i 
needed UnrelEv_flight
into 
a 
small 
carry 
on 
bag 
. 
i 
checked+in ScrEv_check_in
and 
then 
went ScrEv_go_security_checks
to 
security 
. 
security 
moved+along ScrEv_go_security_checks
quickly 
and 
i 
was 
waiting ScrEv_wait_boarding
at 
my 
gate 
to 
catch RelNScrEv_flight
my 
flight 
. 
jfk 
airport 
is UnrelEv_flight
pretty 
gross 
! 
while 
i 
was 
waiting ScrEv_wait_boarding
, 
i 
had UnrelEv_flight
a 
beer 
at 
a 
restaurant 
. 
a 
roach 
fell UnrelEv_flight
on 
my 
husband 
who 
was UnrelEv_flight
with 
me 
! 
we 
quietly 
called UnrelEv_flight
our 
server 
over 
and 
she 
stepped+on UnrelEv_flight
it 
and 
told UnrelEv_flight
us 
it 
happens UnrelEv_flight
all 
the 
time 
! 
we 
were UnrelEv_flight
so 
disgusted 
. 
it 
actually 
made UnrelEv_flight
us 
want 
to 
get+on ScrEv_board_plane
the 
plane 
even 
quicker 
and 
get UnrelEv_flight
out 
of 
there 
. 
finally 
, 
we 
boarded ScrEv_board_plane
the 
plane 
and 
were 
seated ScrEv_take_seat
next 
to 
some 
nice 
people 
from 
oregon 
. 
we 
chatted UnrelEv_flight
a 
bit 
with 
them 
and 
i 
watched UnrelEv_flight
an 
in-flight 
movie 
of 
jane 
eyre 
. 
finally 
we 
got UnrelEv_flight
to 
iceland 
. 
i 
loved UnrelEv_flight
flying RelNScrEv_flight
! 
<end_of_story>_flight 
we 
had UnrelEv_flight
finally 
earned UnrelEv_flight
enough 
points 
to 
travel RelNScrEv_flight
to 
portland 
. 
husband 
bought ScrEv_get_ticket
the 
tickets 
a 
few 
months 
before 
our 
trip 
. 
as 
the 
date 
of 
departure 
neared UnrelEv_flight
, 
i 
began UnrelEv_flight
to 
prepare ScrEv_other_flight
for 
the 
flight 
and 
trip 
. 
i 
packed ScrEv_pack_luggage
our 
clothes 
and 
planned ScrEv_other_flight
things 
to 
do UnrelEv_flight
. 
his 
parents 
drove ScrEv_get_airport
us 
to 
the 
fly 
away 
and 
we 
took ScrEv_other_flight
a 
bus 
from 
there 
to 
the 
airport 
. 
we 
walked ScrEv_go_check_in
up 
to 
the 
airline 
counter 
and 
checked+in ScrEv_check_in
for 
the 
flight 
. 
we 
decided UnrelEv_flight
to 
carry RelNScrEv_flight
our 
luggage 
on 
, 
since 
it 
was 
n't 
over 
sized UnrelEv_flight
. 
the 
lady 
gave ScrEv_other_flight
us 
our 
boarding 
passes 
and 
we 
walked+over ScrEv_other_flight
to 
the 
line 
to 
get+through ScrEv_go_security_checks
the 
security 
checkpoint 
. 
the 
line 
was UnrelEv_flight
pretty 
short 
, 
so 
we 
made ScrEv_wait
it 
to 
the 
front 
rather 
quickly 
. 
the 
attendant 
check ScrEv_present_ID/ticket
our 
ids 
. 
we 
took+off ScrEv_go_security_checks
our 
shoes 
, 
husband 
took+off ScrEv_go_security_checks
his 
belt 
, 
and 
we 
placed ScrEv_go_security_checks
our 
luggage 
on 
the 
x-ray 
belt 
. 
he 
emptied RelNScrEv_flight
his 
pockets 
and 
we 
walked+through ScrEv_go_security_checks
the 
metal 
detector 
. 
everything 
went UnrelEv_flight
without 
a 
hitch 
and 
we 
grabbed RelNScrEv_flight
our 
belongings 
and 
put RelNScrEv_flight
our 
shoes 
back 
on 
. 
we 
walked ScrEv_find_terminal
to 
our 
gate 
and 
soon 
they 
called ScrEv_listen_call
for 
boarding ScrEv_board_plane
. 
we 
walked ScrEv_board_plane
out 
the 
door 
, 
onto 
the 
tarmac 
, 
up 
the 
stairs 
to 
the 
airplane 
, 
into 
the 
airplane 
, 
put ScrEv_stow_away_luggage
our 
baggage 
up 
in 
the 
compartments 
, 
and 
took ScrEv_take_seat
our 
seats 
. 
we 
held UnrelEv_flight
hands 
as 
they 
went+over ScrEv_listen_crew
the 
safety 
protocol 
and 
the 
plane 
taxied ScrEv_take_off_preparations
to 
take+off ScrEv_take_off
. 
when 
it 
took+off ScrEv_take_off
, 
i 
closed UnrelEv_flight
my 
eyes 
and 
soon 
we 
were 
soaring RelNScrEv_flight
in 
the 
air 
. 
we 
flew RelNScrEv_flight
over 
for 
a 
few 
hours 
and 
then 
had UnrelEv_flight
a 
gentle 
landing ScrEv_landing
. 
we 
deplaned ScrEv_exit_plane
and 
walked ScrEv_get_destination_airport
into 
the 
terminal 
. 
<end_of_story>_flight 
last 
week 
, 
i 
flew+in+an+airplane Evoking_flight
to 
visit UnrelEv_flight
a 
different 
state 
. 
after 
i 
parked RelNScrEv_flight
my 
car 
in 
the 
parking 
lot 
, 
i 
found ScrEv_go_check_in
the 
right 
ticket 
counter 
for 
my 
airline 
and 
then 
turned+in ScrEv_check_in
my 
suitcase 
so 
it 
could 
travel RelNScrEv_flight
in 
the 
cargo 
of 
the 
plane 
. 
then 
i 
went ScrEv_find_terminal
to 
a 
place 
called UnrelEv_flight
a 
gate 
which 
is UnrelEv_flight
really 
just 
an 
indoor 
place 
to 
wait ScrEv_wait_boarding
for 
my 
plane 
to 
arrive ScrEv_other_flight
. 
it 
has UnrelEv_flight
a 
big 
window 
where 
i 
watched UnrelEv_flight
the 
planes 
and 
waited+for ScrEv_wait_boarding
my 
turn 
to 
get+on ScrEv_board_plane
one 
. 
once 
my 
plane 
arrived ScrEv_other_flight
, 
a 
nice 
flight 
attendant 
showed RelNScrEv_flight
me 
to 
my 
seat 
and 
i 
sat+down ScrEv_take_seat
to 
wait ScrEv_wait
. 
my 
seat 
was UnrelEv_flight
comfortable 
, 
but 
small 
, 
and 
there 
were UnrelEv_flight
people 
sitting UnrelEv_flight
on 
each 
side 
of 
me 
. 
once 
everyone 
settled+in RelNScrEv_flight
, 
the 
plane 
started ScrEv_take_off_preparations
and 
then 
drove+down ScrEv_take_off_preparations
the 
runway 
to 
wait ScrEv_take_off_preparations
its 
turn 
to 
take+off ScrEv_take_off
. 
when 
we 
took+off ScrEv_take_off
, 
it 
rose ScrEv_take_off
into 
the 
air 
and 
then 
leveled+off RelNScrEv_flight
to 
what 
the 
pilot 
called UnrelEv_flight
cruising 
speed 
. 
then 
the 
flight 
attendants 
brought+around ScrEv_other_flight
food 
and 
drinks 
. 
the 
plane 
was UnrelEv_flight
a 
little 
noisy 
, 
but 
it 
was UnrelEv_flight
fun 
to 
watch ScrEv_spend_time_flight
the 
people 
and 
the 
food 
was UnrelEv_flight
pretty 
good 
. 
the 
plane 
ride 
was UnrelEv_flight
short 
and 
we 
had UnrelEv_flight
barely 
finished ScrEv_spend_time_flight
our 
food 
and 
drinks 
before 
the 
pilot 
said ScrEv_listen_crew
it 
was UnrelEv_flight
time 
to 
land RelNScrEv_flight
in 
the 
next 
town 
. 
the 
flight 
attendants 
came+back UnrelEv_flight
around 
to 
pick+up RelNScrEv_flight
our 
trash 
and 
then 
we 
had 
to 
buckle ScrEv_buckle_seat_belt
our 
seat 
belts 
again 
for 
the 
plane 
to 
land ScrEv_landing
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_flight
a 
fun 
trip 
and 
i 
hope UnrelEv_flight
i 
get UnrelEv_flight
to 
do UnrelEv_flight
it 
again 
sometime 
. 
<end_of_story>_flight 
a 
month 
ago 
, 
i 
bought+a+plane+ticket Evoking_flight
online 
. 
i 
chose ScrEv_get_ticket
a 
round-trip 
ticket 
and 
was 
able 
to 
pick RelNScrEv_flight
a 
window 
seat 
. 
the 
day 
of 
my 
flight 
, 
i 
arrived ScrEv_get_airport
at 
the 
airport 
523 
hours 
early 
to 
be 
able 
to 
check+in ScrEv_check_in
and 
go+through ScrEv_go_security_checks
security 
with 
plenty 
of 
time 
to 
spare UnrelEv_flight
to 
make RelNScrEv_flight
my 
flight 
on 
time 
. 
i 
boarded ScrEv_board_plane
the 
plane 
. 
i 
placed ScrEv_stow_away_luggage
my 
baggage 
in 
the 
overhead 
bin 
and 
took ScrEv_take_seat
my 
seat 
near 
the 
window 
. 
two 
people 
sat RelNScrEv_flight
next 
to 
me 
, 
filling UnrelEv_flight
out 
the 
row 
. 
i 
put ScrEv_buckle_seat_belt
on 
my 
seat 
belt 
. 
the 
stewardess 
informed ScrEv_listen_crew
everyone 
about 
safety 
precautions 
. 
everyone 
put ScrEv_take_off_preparations
their 
seats 
in 
the 
upright 
position 
and 
locked+up ScrEv_take_off_preparations
their 
tray 
tables 
. 
the 
pilot 
spoke ScrEv_listen_crew
to 
us 
over 
the 
intercom 
, 
telling ScrEv_listen_crew
us 
to 
sit+back UnrelEv_flight
and 
relax UnrelEv_flight
, 
and 
that 
we 
will 
reach RelNScrEv_flight
our 
destination 
in 
a 
short 
time 
. 
the 
plane 
rumbled ScrEv_take_off_preparations
to 
life 
, 
sped ScrEv_take_off_preparations
forward 
, 
and 
off 
we 
soared ScrEv_take_off
into 
the 
sky 
. 
my 
ears 
popped RelNScrEv_flight
from 
the 
change 
in 
air 
pressure 
but 
it 
only 
took UnrelEv_flight
a 
few 
moments 
for 
my 
body 
to 
acclimate RelNScrEv_flight
itself 
to 
its 
new 
, 
airborne 
environment 
. 
the 
stewardess 
served ScrEv_other_flight
the 
passengers 
drinks 
and 
peanuts 
. 
i 
took ScrEv_spend_time_flight
a 
nap 
. 
once 
i 
awoke ScrEv_spend_time_flight
, 
we 
were 
landing ScrEv_landing
. 
we 
were 
told UnrelEv_flight
to 
put RelNScrEv_flight
our 
seats 
back 
in 
the 
upright 
position 
and 
to 
lock RelNScrEv_flight
back 
up 
our 
tray 
tables 
. 
we 
glided ScrEv_landing
to 
the 
ground 
and 
landed ScrEv_landing
with 
a 
bit 
of 
a 
bump 
and 
jolt 
. 
the 
plane 
pulled+up ScrEv_other_flight
to 
the 
gate 
and 
we 
were 
let+off ScrEv_exit_plane

<end_of_story>_flight 
i 
flew+from+amsterdam+to+new+york+city Evoking_flight
last 
week 
. 
i 
had 
purchased ScrEv_get_ticket
and 
reserved ScrEv_get_ticket
my 
ticket 
a 
week 
in 
advance 
. 
i 
left UnrelEv_flight
the 
hostel 
i 
was 
staying UnrelEv_flight
and 
arrived ScrEv_get_airport
at 
schiphol 
airport 
at 
about 
21:00 
. 
after 
waiting ScrEv_wait
about 
523 
hours 
for 
the 
flight 
check-in ScrEv_check_in
, 
i 
boarded ScrEv_board_plane
the 
plane 
. 
i 
went ScrEv_other_flight
to 
and 
found ScrEv_take_seat
my 
seat 
, 
located UnrelEv_flight
on 
the 
left-hand 
side 
near 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
plane 
. 
i 
placed ScrEv_stow_away_luggage
some 
of 
my 
hand 
luggage 
in 
an 
overhead 
compartment 
and 
sat ScrEv_take_seat
down 
next 
to 
another 
passenger 
who 
was 
seated RelNScrEv_flight
to 
my 
right 
. 
i 
watched UnrelEv_flight
the 
rest 
of 
remaining 
passengers 
who 
were 
heading UnrelEv_flight
to 
their 
seats 
. 
about 
523 
minutes 
later 
, 
once 
everyone 
was 
seated RelNScrEv_flight
and 
were 
given ScrEv_listen_crew
basic 
safety 
instructions 
by 
the 
flight 
attendants

announced ScrEv_listen_crew

we

the

engines 
then

, 
and 
we 
were UnrelEv_flight
soon 
airborne 
with 
amsterdam 
soon 
far 
below 
us 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_flight
a 
evening 
flight 
, 
so 
i 
slept ScrEv_spend_time_flight
on 
and 
off 
for 
a 
little 
while 
, 
then 
began UnrelEv_flight
watching ScrEv_spend_time_flight
an 
in-flight 
movie 
. 
after 
about 
523 
hours 
, 
we 
were 
served ScrEv_spend_time_flight
a 
light 
dinner 
of 
a 
chicken 
entree 
, 
bread 
, 
and 
juice 
. 
the 
food 
was UnrelEv_flight
surprisingly 
tasty 
and 
i 
enjoyed UnrelEv_flight
it 
. 
after 
finishing UnrelEv_flight
my 
meal 
, 
i 
relaxed UnrelEv_flight
and 
occasionally 
looked ScrEv_spend_time_flight
out 
the 
window 
at 
the 
night 
sky 
, 
as 
well 
as 
occasionally 
chatting ScrEv_spend_time_flight
with 
the 
person 
sitting 
next 
to 
me 
. 
finally 
, 
the 
pilot 
announced ScrEv_listen_crew
that 
we 
were 
approaching ScrEv_get_destination_airport
jfk 
airport 
. 
the 
plane 
touched ScrEv_landing
down 
shortly 
afterwards 
, 
and 
we 
safely 
landed ScrEv_landing
in 
new 
york 
.

, 
i 
got ScrEv_get_airport

523 
hours 
early 
. 
i 
checked+in ScrEv_check_in
at 
a 
big 
desk 
where 
they 
give ScrEv_get_ticket
me 
my 
ticket 
, 
weighed ScrEv_other_flight
my 
suitcase 
, 
and 
put ScrEv_other_flight
my 
suitcase 
on 
a 
big 
conveyor 
belt 
to 
take RelNScrEv_flight
it 
to 
my 
plane 
. 
i 
went+over ScrEv_other_flight
to 
a 
big 
line 
of 
people 
and 
waited ScrEv_wait
my 
turn 
to 
go+through ScrEv_go_security_checks
security 
. 
when 
i 
was UnrelEv_flight
safely 
through

i 
waited ScrEv_wait_boarding
until 
they 
called ScrEv_listen_call
my 
seat 
number 
and 
i 
boarded ScrEv_board_plane
the 
plane 
. 
i 
found ScrEv_take_seat
my

in 
my 
row 
. 
i 
got RelNScrEv_flight
a 
window 
seat 
! 
we 
all 
fastened ScrEv_buckle_seat_belt
our 
seat 
belts 
and 
listened ScrEv_listen_crew
to 
the 
flight 
attendants 
give RelNScrEv_flight
us 
safety 
information 
about 
flying RelNScrEv_flight
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_flight
short 
flight 
, 
but 
the 
flight 
attendants 
still 
brought ScrEv_other_flight
us 
snacks 
and 
drinks 
on 
a 
little 
cart 
that 
they 
rolled UnrelEv_flight
down 
the 
aisle 
. 
when 
the 
plane 
landed ScrEv_landing
, 
we 
all 
lined+up ScrEv_other_flight
and 
walked+out ScrEv_exit_plane
of 
the 
plane 
door 
. 
the 
pilot 
was UnrelEv_flight
there 
waving+goodbye RelNScrEv_flight
to 
us 
all 
! 
<end_of_story>_flight 
last 
summer 
, 
i 
decided UnrelEv_flight
to 
visit UnrelEv_flight
my 
friend 
emily 
. 
she 
lives UnrelEv_flight
very 
far 
from 
me 
: 
i 
live UnrelEv_flight
in 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
country 
, 
and 
she 
lives UnrelEv_flight
on 
the 
coast 
. 
so 
, 
i 
had UnrelEv_flight
to 
visit UnrelEv_flight
by 
flying+there+in+an+airplane Evoking_flight
. 
i 
got+up UnrelEv_flight
very 
early 
in 
the 
morning 
so 
that 
i 
could 
drive ScrEv_get_airport
to 
the 
airport 
- 
it 
was UnrelEv_flight
still 
dark 
outside 
when 
i 
left UnrelEv_flight
my 
house 
. 
i 
parked RelNScrEv_flight
in 
the 
lot 
, 
picked+up UnrelEv_flight
my 
duffle 
bag 
and 
slung UnrelEv_flight
it 
across 
my 
shoulders 
, 
and 
walked ScrEv_get_airport
into 
the 
airport 
. 
i 
went ScrEv_go_check_in
to 
the 
ticket 
counter 
to 
check ScrEv_check_in
in 
at 
one 
of 
the 
kiosks 
, 
so 
that 
the 
airline 
knew UnrelEv_flight
i 
would 
be 
flying Evoking_flight
that 
day 
, 
and 
then 
i 
had 
to 
go+through ScrEv_go_security_checks
the 
security 
line 
. 
i 
was 
flying RelNScrEv_flight
on 
a 
weekday 
, 
so 
the 
line 
was ScrEv_wait
very 
long 
with 
people 
who 
were 
flying RelNScrEv_flight
for 
work 
, 
even 
though 
it 
was UnrelEv_flight
still 
early 
in 
the 
morning 
. 
i 
checked UnrelEv_flight
my 
email 
while 
i 
waited ScrEv_wait
, 
sent ScrEv_other_flight
my 
bags 
through 
the 
x-ray 
machine 
, 
and 
finally 
stepped+out ScrEv_find_terminal
into 
the 
main 
terminal 
of 
the 
airport 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_flight
bright 
and 
sunny 
, 
with 
lots 
of 
people 
rushing UnrelEv_flight
everywhere 
. 
i 
walked+over ScrEv_find_terminal
to 
my 
gate 
, 
and 
waited ScrEv_wait_boarding
for 
my 
section 
of 
the 
plane 
to 
be 
called ScrEv_listen_call
to 
board ScrEv_board_plane
. 
the 
flight 
crew 
got UnrelEv_flight
to 
my 
section 
, 
and 
i 
walked ScrEv_board_plane
onto 
my 
plane 
, 
being UnrelEv_flight
careful 
to 
hold RelNScrEv_flight
my 
bags 
so 
that 
they 
would 
n't 
bump RelNScrEv_flight
into 
the 
people 
who 
were 
already 
sitting RelNScrEv_flight
down 
. 
i 
put ScrEv_stow_away_luggage
my 
luggage 
in 
the 
overhead 
compartments 
and 
made+sure UnrelEv_flight
it 
was UnrelEv_flight
secure 
so 
that 
it 
would 
n't 
fall RelNScrEv_flight
on 
anyone 
, 
and 
then 
i 
sat+down ScrEv_take_seat
in 
my 
assigned RelNScrEv_flight
seat 
and 
put ScrEv_buckle_seat_belt
my 
seatbelt 
on 
. 
i 
pulled+out UnrelEv_flight
a 
book 
i 
brought UnrelEv_flight
with 
me 
, 
and 
read ScrEv_spend_time_flight
until 
the 
plane 
was UnrelEv_flight
ready 
to 
take+off ScrEv_take_off
. 
i 
listened ScrEv_listen_crew
to 
the 
flight 
attendant 
's 
safety 
instructions 
, 
and 
then 
the 
plane 
started UnrelEv_flight
to 
move RelNScrEv_flight
- 
with 
a 
mighty 
jerk 
, 
the 
wheels 
left ScrEv_take_off
the 
ground 
and 
we 
were UnrelEv_flight
flying RelNScrEv_flight
. 
it 
was RelNScrEv_flight
very 
loud 
with 
the 
noise 
of 
the 
engine 
. 
a 
few 
minutes 
after 
we 
took+off ScrEv_take_off
, 
the 
pilot 
came ScrEv_listen_crew
on 
the 
intercom 
and 
gave ScrEv_leave_airport
us 
some 
details 
about 
the 
weather 
and 
our 
flight 
time 
. 
then 
, 
the 
flight 
attendants 
walked+past ScrEv_other_flight
in 
the 
aisles 
with 
their 
cart 
, 
and 
offered ScrEv_other_flight
me 
a 
drink 
. 
i 
got ScrEv_other_flight
a 
cup 
of 
coffee 
, 
and 
drank ScrEv_spend_time_flight
it 
while 
i 
read ScrEv_spend_time_flight
my 
book 
. 
a 
few 
hours 
later 
, 
the 
pilot 
came ScrEv_listen_crew
on 
the 
intercom 
and 
let UnrelEv_flight
us 
know UnrelEv_flight
we 
were 
getting RelNScrEv_flight
ready 
to 
land ScrEv_landing
. 
i 
put RelNScrEv_flight
my 
book 
away 
, 
turned+off ScrEv_other_flight
my 
phone 
like 
the 
flight 
attendants 
asked UnrelEv_flight
, 
and 
made+sure ScrEv_other_flight
everything 
was 
secure 
. 
the 
plane 
landed ScrEv_landing
with 
a 
bump 
. 
after 
a 
few 
minutes 
of 
waiting ScrEv_other_flight
on 
the 
ground 
, 
a 
gate 
opened+up ScrEv_other_flight
, 
and 
we 
were 
allowed UnrelEv_flight
to 
get+up ScrEv_other_flight
and 
stretch RelNScrEv_flight
, 
and 
get ScrEv_other_flight
our 
bags 
out 
of 
the 
compartments 
. 
a 
few 
minutes 
later 
, 
i 
walked+off ScrEv_exit_plane
the 
plane 
with 
my 
bags 
, 
and 
walked+out ScrEv_exit_plane
to 
the 
waiting 
area 
to 
meet ScrEv_meet_people
my 
friend 
. 
flying+in+a+plane Evoking_flight
was UnrelEv_flight
an 
interesting 
experience 
. 
<end_of_story>_flight 
two 
years 
ago 
was UnrelEv_flight
my 
first 
and 
only 
airplane+flight Evoking_flight
. 
i 
was 
moving UnrelEv_flight
from 
the 
state 
of 
kansas 
to 
the 
state 
of 
washington 
, 
permanently 
. 
i 
had 
ordered ScrEv_get_ticket
my 
tickets 
three 
months 
in 
advance 
, 
with 
a 
little 
bit 
of 
hassle 
due 
to 
rescheduling RelNScrEv_flight
-lrb- 
it 
was UnrelEv_flight
free 
, 
thankfully 
, 
-rrb- 
and 
met RelNScrEv_flight
with 
my 
parents 
at 
the 
airport 
. 
after 
they 
wished UnrelEv_flight
me 
goodbye 
i 
took ScrEv_go_security_checks
my 
luggage 
to 
the 
security 
area 
, 
got 
cleared ScrEv_go_security_checks
ten 
minutes 
in 
advance 
, 
and 
waited ScrEv_wait_boarding
for 
my 
plane 
, 
listening ScrEv_listen_call
carefully 
for 
my 
number 
while 
i 
played UnrelEv_flight
my 
nintendo 
ds 
. 
after 
that 
, 
we 
were 
all 
filed ScrEv_board_plane
single 
line 
into 
my 
plane 
, 
and 
i 
took ScrEv_take_seat
a 
seat 
- 
it 
was UnrelEv_flight
an 
open+seated RelNScrEv_flight
plane 
- 
and 
i 
waited ScrEv_wait_boarding
to 
take+off ScrEv_take_off
! 
it 
was RelNScrEv_flight
super 
shaky 
due 
to 
turbulence 
but 
the 
flight 
was UnrelEv_flight
otherwise 
a 
very 
boring 
two 
hours 
- 
i 
fell+asleep ScrEv_spend_time_flight
several 
times 
waiting ScrEv_spend_time_flight
for 
us 
to 
get RelNScrEv_flight
there 
, 
and 
also 
ordered ScrEv_spend_time_flight
soda 
and 
a 
few 
snacks 
. 
i 
was 
allowed UnrelEv_flight
to 
play ScrEv_spend_time_flight
my 
games 
on 
the 
plane 
as 
long 
as 
it 
did 
n't 
use UnrelEv_flight
any 
wireless 
networks 
, 
but 
they 
got UnrelEv_flight
boring 
after 
a 
while 
. 
when 
i 
got+off ScrEv_exit_plane
, 
i 
made+sure UnrelEv_flight
to 
grab ScrEv_other_flight
my 
carry-on 
and 
meet ScrEv_meet_people
my 
ride 
to 
the 
new

<end_of_story>_flight 
in 
september 
523

i 
rode+and+flew+in+an+airplane Evoking_flight
on 
my 
way 
back 
home 
from 
my 
parents 
' 
country 
of 
birth 
, 
the 
philippines 
. 
i 
rode+two+different+planes Evoking_flight
, 
but 
this 
one 
will 
be UnrelEv_flight
about 
the 
second 
one 
, 
the 
trip 
on 
the 
way 
back 
to 
the 
united 
states 
. 
i 
was ScrEv_get_airport
in 
narita 
international 
airport 
and 
boarding ScrEv_board_plane
my 
second 
flight 
. 
i 
forgot UnrelEv_flight
which 
airline 
it 
was UnrelEv_flight
. 
but 
like 
one 
would 
normally 
do UnrelEv_flight
, 
i 
waited ScrEv_wait
in 
line 
, 
showed ScrEv_present_ID/ticket
the 
boarding 
attendant 
my 
ticket 
and 
passport 
, 
and 
headed ScrEv_get_plane
to 
the 
tunnel 
connecting RelNScrEv_flight
the 
building 
and 
the 
plane 
. 
as 
i 
headed ScrEv_other_flight
for 
my 
seat 
, 
i 
tried UnrelEv_flight
looking+at RelNScrEv_flight
the 
seat 
numbers 
on 
the 
compartments 
above 
them 
. 
i 
found ScrEv_take_seat
mine 
, 
and 
opened ScrEv_other_flight
the 
compartment 
to 
put ScrEv_stow_away_luggage
my 
carry-on 
in 
. 
i 
sat+down ScrEv_take_seat
and 
tried UnrelEv_flight
to 
make UnrelEv_flight
myself 
comfortable 
. 
in 
about 
523 
minutes 
, 
we 
were ScrEv_take_off_preparations
ready 
for 
take-off 
. 
the 
flight 
attendant 
made ScrEv_listen_crew
some 
announcements 
, 
and 
we 
were 
set UnrelEv_flight
. 
i 
was 
seated RelNScrEv_flight
by 
the 
window 
, 
as 
i 
always 
do UnrelEv_flight
. 
i 
love+sitting UnrelEv_flight
by 
the 
window 
. 
the 
view 
is UnrelEv_flight
awe-inspiring 
when 
you 
' 
re UnrelEv_flight
that 
high 
. 
i 
decided UnrelEv_flight
to 
open+up ScrEv_spend_time_flight
a 
fresh 
set 
of 
earphones 
and 
browsed ScrEv_spend_time_flight
the 
media 
player 
in 
front 
of 
me 
, 
and 
watched ScrEv_spend_time_flight
avengers 
. 
my 
viewing ScrEv_spend_time_flight
was 
interrupted UnrelEv_flight
when 
dinner 
was 
being 
served ScrEv_spend_time_flight
. 
i 
love UnrelEv_flight
airport 
food 
as 
well 
, 
for 
the 
most 
part 
. 
it 
' 
s UnrelEv_flight
not 
always 
the 
best 
, 
but 
most 
of 
the 
time 
i 
like UnrelEv_flight
it 
. 
after 
eating ScrEv_spend_time_flight
, 
i 
finished ScrEv_spend_time_flight
the 
movie 
and 
fell+asleep ScrEv_spend_time_flight
. 
for 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
flight 
, 
i 
saw UnrelEv_flight
clouds 
, 
sunshine 
, 
and 
other 
planes 
, 
and 
by 
nighttime 
, 
we 
landed ScrEv_landing
in 
new 
york 
, 
at 
the 
jfk 
international 
airport 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_flight
a 
great 
flight 
. 
<end_of_story>_flight 
several 
months 
ago 
i 
had 
to 
travel UnrelEv_flight
to 
a 
city 
in 
the 
midwest 
for 
a 
business 
conference 
. 
i 
needed 
to 
take+a+plane Evoking_flight
to 
get UnrelEv_flight
there 
. 
i 
had 
to 
purchase ScrEv_get_ticket
a 
ticket 
, 
so 
i 
went UnrelEv_flight
online 
to 
a 
travel 
website 
. 
there 
were UnrelEv_flight
a 
lot 
of 
options 
to 
choose RelNScrEv_flight
from 
. 
i 
first 
picked UnrelEv_flight
the 
day 
i 
wanted 
to 
travel RelNScrEv_flight
, 
and 
what 
airport 
i 
was 
leaving RelNScrEv_flight
from 
, 
and 
where 
i 
was 
going UnrelEv_flight
to 
. 
i 
then 
had 
to 
choose UnrelEv_flight
when 
i 
wanted 
to 
leave UnrelEv_flight
, 
in 
the 
morning 
or 
the 
afternoon 
. 
i 
chose UnrelEv_flight
everything 
i 
needed UnrelEv_flight
and 
purchased ScrEv_get_ticket
my 
ticket 
with 
my 
credit 
card 
. 
the 
day 
of 
my 
flight 
, 
i 
drove ScrEv_get_airport
to 
the 
airport 
and 
parked RelNScrEv_flight
in 
the 
parking 
garage 
. 
i 
took ScrEv_go_check_in
my 
luggage 
inside 
to 
the 
ticketing 
counter 
. 
i 
told UnrelEv_flight
the 
attendant 
i 
where 
i 
was 
flying RelNScrEv_flight
to 
and 
the 
flight 
number 
, 
and 
that 
i 
had UnrelEv_flight
a 
bag 
to 
check RelNScrEv_flight
. 
she 
took ScrEv_present_ID/ticket
my 
identification 
card 
and 
the 
flight 
information 
, 
and 
checked ScrEv_check_in
me 
in 
for 
the 
flight 
. 
she 
put ScrEv_other_flight
a 
big 
tag 
on 
my 
bag 
, 
and 
put UnrelEv_flight
it 
on 
a 
moving UnrelEv_flight
conveyor 
belt 
behind 
her 
and 
it 
disappeared UnrelEv_flight
. 
i 
knew UnrelEv_flight
it 
would 
be 
safe 
and 
arrive RelNScrEv_flight
when 
i 
did UnrelEv_flight
, 
but 
it 
did 
seem UnrelEv_flight
kind 
of 
mysterious 
. 
i 
then 
took ScrEv_other_flight
my 
ticket 
and 
went+to ScrEv_go_security_checks
the 
security 
checkpoint 
. 
i 
went+through ScrEv_go_security_checks
a 
large 
machine 
, 
but 
i 
was UnrelEv_flight
n't 
nervous 
. 
i 
then 
went ScrEv_find_terminal
to 
my 
gate 
to 
wait ScrEv_wait_boarding
for 
my 
flight 
. 
eventually 
we 
were 
told ScrEv_listen_call
that 
we 
could 
board ScrEv_board_plane
. 
we 
all 
got+on ScrEv_board_plane
the 
plane 
and 
took ScrEv_take_seat
our 
seats 
. 
when 
everyone 
was UnrelEv_flight
on 
, 
we 
fastened ScrEv_buckle_seat_belt
our 
seatbelts 
and 
began UnrelEv_flight
to 
move RelNScrEv_flight
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_flight
fun 
looking+out ScrEv_spend_time_flight
the 
window 
. 
all 
of 
sudden 
we 
were 
speeding RelNScrEv_flight
very 
fast 
down 
the 
runway 
, 
and 
then 
lifted ScrEv_take_off
into 
the 
air 
. 
it 
's UnrelEv_flight
surprising 
such 
a 
big 
plane 
can 
fly RelNScrEv_flight
so 
easily 
. 
i 
watched ScrEv_spend_time_flight
as 
the 
world 
seemed UnrelEv_flight
to 
get UnrelEv_flight
smaller 
. 
we 
then 
leveled+off ScrEv_other_flight
and 
flew RelNScrEv_flight
straight 
to 
our 
destination 
. 
i 
slept ScrEv_spend_time_flight
a 
bit 
on 
the 
plane 
, 
and 
read ScrEv_spend_time_flight
a 
book 
that 
i 
brought UnrelEv_flight
. 
they 
did UnrelEv_flight
offer ScrEv_other_flight
us 
some 
snacks 
and 
drinks 
. 
a 
short 
time 
later 
, 
the 
captain 
announced ScrEv_listen_crew
we 
were 
going 
to 
land ScrEv_landing
. 
everyone 
put ScrEv_other_flight
their 
items 
away 
, 
and 
we 
landed ScrEv_landing
soon 
after 
. 
when 
we 
got ScrEv_get_destination_airport
to 
the 
gate 
, 
everyone 
undid ScrEv_other_flight
their 
seat 
belts 
and 
started UnrelEv_flight
to 
exit ScrEv_exit_plane
the 
plane 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_flight
a 
very 
good 
and 
smooth 
flight 
in 
the 
airplane 
. 
<end_of_story>_flight 
my 
first 
flight+out+of+the+united+states+was+to+myanmar Evoking_flight
. 
i 
was+excited UnrelEv_flight
but 
very 
nervous 
all 
at 
the 
same 
time 
. 
going+through ScrEv_go_security_checks
security 
checks 
and 
all 
that 
comes UnrelEv_flight
with 
it 
is 
nerve 
racking UnrelEv_flight
. 
but 
once 
i 
finished UnrelEv_flight
with 
that 
part 
, 
the 
next 
thing 
was 
understand RelNScrEv_flight
the 
time 
change 
and 
how 
that 
affects RelNScrEv_flight
my 
flights 
and 
connections 
was UnrelEv_flight
a 
real 
hassle 
. 
once 
we 
got ScrEv_board_plane
on 
the 
plane 
it 
was UnrelEv_flight
absolutely 
wonderful 
. 
the 
flight 
attendants 
took RelNScrEv_flight
great 
care 
of 
us 
never 
stopping UnrelEv_flight
to 
rest UnrelEv_flight
for 
the 
entire 
523 
hours 
flight 
. 
they 
brought ScrEv_other_flight
food 
, 
warm 
face 
towels 
, 
drinks 
and 
snacks 
and 
all 
this 
was 
included RelNScrEv_flight
in 
the 
price 
of 
the 
ticket 
. 
i 
am UnrelEv_flight
very 
afraid 
of 
flying RelNScrEv_flight
the 
take+off ScrEv_take_off
the 
landing ScrEv_landing
are 
the 
worst 
parts 
for 
me 
. 
true 
to 
my 
phobia 
i 
was UnrelEv_flight
in 
near 
tears 
and 
gripping UnrelEv_flight
the 
seats 
but 
once 
the 
flight 
was UnrelEv_flight
off 
the 
ground 
i 
was UnrelEv_flight
happy 
. 
the 
flight 
came UnrelEv_flight
with 
a 
tv 
in 
the 
back 
of 
the 
set 
in 
front 
of 
you 
and 
there 
was UnrelEv_flight
so 
many 
choices 
of 
what 
to 
watch ScrEv_spend_time_flight
. 
i 
love UnrelEv_flight
documentaries 
and 
there 
were UnrelEv_flight
numerous 
ones 
. 
i 
almost 
hated UnrelEv_flight
when 
the 
flight 
was UnrelEv_flight
over 
. 
the 
only 
part 
that 
i 
found UnrelEv_flight
difficult 
was 
that 
, 
i 
did 
not 
have UnrelEv_flight
an 
end 
seat 
and 
so 
i 
hesitated UnrelEv_flight
to 
use RelNScrEv_flight
the 
bathroom 
and 
did 
n't 
do UnrelEv_flight
so 
until 
i 
was UnrelEv_flight
in 
extreme 
discomfort 
because 
i 
did 
n't 
want 
to 
bother UnrelEv_flight
the 
person 
on 
the 
end 
seat 
. 
so 
, 
next 
time 
i 
decide UnrelEv_flight
to 
travel RelNScrEv_flight
the 
only 
change 
i 
would 
make UnrelEv_flight
is 
to 
select RelNScrEv_flight
an 
end 
seat 
that 
way 
bathroom 
use UnrelEv_flight
is 
not 
an 
issue 
. 
<end_of_story>_flight 
my 
sons 
and 
i 
were 
invited UnrelEv_flight
by 
their 
grandmother 
to 
come UnrelEv_flight
for 
a 
visit 
. 
we 
decided UnrelEv_flight
to 
fly+across+the+country Evoking_flight
. 
we 
went ScrEv_get_airport
to 
the 
airport 
and 
purchased ScrEv_get_ticket
plane 
tickets 
. 
then 
we 
went UnrelEv_flight
home 
and 
packed ScrEv_pack_luggage
our 
suitcases 
. 
the 
next 
day 
we 
took ScrEv_get_airport
a 
cab 
to 
the 
airport 
and 
hour 
early 
. 
we 
went ScrEv_go_check_in
to 
the 
airlines 
check 
in 
area 
an 
waited ScrEv_wait
in 
line 
to 
show ScrEv_present_ID/ticket
our 
tickets 
, 
get ScrEv_other_flight
our 
seat 
assignments 
and 
check+out ScrEv_other_flight
bags 
. 
the 
we 
headed ScrEv_find_terminal
upstairs 
to 
the 
airplane 
gate 
. 
there 
were UnrelEv_flight
many 
people 
flying+on+this+plane Evoking_flight
and 
the 
waiting 
room 
was 
crowded UnrelEv_flight
. 
then 
the 
plane 
pulled+in ScrEv_other_flight
next 
to 
the 
gate 
and 
the 
flight 
attendant 
started UnrelEv_flight
calling ScrEv_listen_call
people 
over 
to 
board ScrEv_board_plane
the 
plane 
. 
we 
were UnrelEv_flight
near 
last 
to 
get+on ScrEv_board_plane
the 
plane 
. 
once 
on 
the 
plane 
we 
found ScrEv_other_flight
our 
seats 
and 
sat+down ScrEv_take_seat
. 
after 
the 
plane 
took+off ScrEv_take_off
the 
stewardess 
did RelNScrEv_flight
a 
demonstration 
about 
how 
to 
use RelNScrEv_flight
the 
emergency 
exits 
. 
then 
we 
sat+back UnrelEv_flight
and 
flew RelNScrEv_flight
all 
the 
way 
to 
reno 
, 
nv 
where 
we 
were 
picked+up ScrEv_meet_people
from 
the 
airport 
by 
grandma 
. 
<end_of_story>_flight 
i 
wanted 
to 
go UnrelEv_flight
to 
atlanta 
to 
visit UnrelEv_flight
my 
daughter 
, 
son-in-law 
and 
granddaughter 
. 
i 
went RelNScrEv_flight
on-line 
and 
searched ScrEv_other_flight
for 
the 
cheapest 
flights 
for 
the 
weekend 
on 
which 
i 
wanted 
to 
go UnrelEv_flight
. 
i 
saw UnrelEv_flight
that 
frontier 
airlines 
had UnrelEv_flight
a 
really 
reasonable 
rate 
so 
i 
purchased ScrEv_get_ticket
a 
ticket 
for 
friday 
, 
march 
13th 
through 
sunday 
, 
march 
15th 
. 
several 
hours 
before 
my 
flight 
was RelNScrEv_flight
due 
, 
i 
drove ScrEv_get_airport
to 
national 
airport 
and 
parked RelNScrEv_flight
in 
the 
daily-rate 
lot 
. 
i 
went ScrEv_other_flight
into 
the 
airport 
and 
passed+through ScrEv_go_security_checks
the 
security 
checkpoint 
, 
showing ScrEv_present_ID/ticket
the 
tsa 
agent 
my 
electronic 
ticket\/boarding 
pass 
and 
my 
driver 
's 
license 
. 
once 
through 
security 
i 
waited ScrEv_wait_boarding
at 
the 
gate 
until 
the 
plane 
had 
landed RelNScrEv_flight
for 
my 
flight 
. 
once 
boarding ScrEv_board_plane
started UnrelEv_flight
, 
i 
got ScrEv_wait_boarding
in 
line 
with 
my 
boarding 
pass 
and 
entered ScrEv_board_plane
the 
plane 
. 
i 
found RelNScrEv_flight
my 
seat 
, 
the 
aisle 
seat 
in 
row 
523 
, 
and 
sat+down ScrEv_take_seat
. 
after 
the 
safety 
instructions 
had 
been 
given ScrEv_listen_crew
, 
the 
flight 
taxied ScrEv_take_off_preparations
to 
the 
end 
of 
the 
runway 
and 
then 
took+off ScrEv_take_off
. 
in 
just 
a 
few 
short 
hours 
we 
had 
safely 
touched+down ScrEv_landing
at 
the 
atlanta 
airport 
where 
my 
daughter 
was 
waiting ScrEv_meet_people
for 
me 
. 
<end_of_story>_flight 
when 
i 
was UnrelEv_flight
a 
kid 
, 
my 
dad 
was UnrelEv_flight
a 
licensed RelNScrEv_flight
pilot 
and 
he 
had+a+small+plane Evoking_flight
. 
it 
seated RelNScrEv_flight
523 
. 
he 
lived UnrelEv_flight
in 
a 
small 
town 
about 
523 
hours 
by 
car 
north 
of 
the 
larger 
town 
when 
we 
kids 
lived UnrelEv_flight
with 
our 
mom 
. 
we 
would 
go+visit UnrelEv_flight
my 
dad 
every 
other 
weekend 
. 
my 
grandfather 
was RelNScrEv_flight
a 
pilot 
too 
and 
had RelNScrEv_flight
a 
small 
plane 
. 
his 
was UnrelEv_flight
smaller 
, 
though 
, 
and 
only 
seated RelNScrEv_flight
523 
people 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_flight
fun 
to 
fly RelNScrEv_flight
in 
because 
i 
got UnrelEv_flight
to 
sit ScrEv_take_seat
in 
front 
and 
see UnrelEv_flight
out 
the 
front 
and 
watch ScrEv_spend_time_flight
him 
work RelNScrEv_flight
the 
controls 
. 
when 
we 
flew RelNScrEv_flight
with 
my 
dad 
, 
my 
stepmother 
sat ScrEv_take_seat
in 
the 
front 
seat 
and 
all 
three 
of 
us 
kids 
sat ScrEv_take_seat
in 
the 
back 
seat 
. 
we 
were UnrelEv_flight
small 
, 
so 
we 
all 
fit RelNScrEv_flight
. 
there 
was UnrelEv_flight
n't 
much 
room 
for 
luggage 
, 
but 
my 
dad 
would 
load RelNScrEv_flight
the 
luggage 
behind 
the 
back 
seat 
. 
then 
he 
would 
do ScrEv_take_off_preparations
the 
preflight 
checks 
. 
some 
of 
these 
were UnrelEv_flight
outside 
the 
plane 
, 
but 
most 
of 
them 
were 
done UnrelEv_flight
from 
the 
inside 
. 
he 
would 
radio ScrEv_other_flight
the 
tower 
and 
ask RelNScrEv_flight
for 
permission 
to 
take+off ScrEv_take_off
. 
this 
was UnrelEv_flight
always 
very 
exciting UnrelEv_flight
. 
the 
takeoff ScrEv_take_off
was UnrelEv_flight
a 
little 
scary 
because 
in 
a 
plane 
that 
small 
you 
could 
really 
feel UnrelEv_flight
the 
wind 
and 
the 
forces 
of 
the 
take+off ScrEv_take_off
. 
the 
flight 
itself 
was UnrelEv_flight
fairly 
boring 
because 
you 
could 
n't 
really 
see UnrelEv_flight
anything 
from 
the 
back 
. 
sadly 
, 
i 
had UnrelEv_flight
bad 
motion 
sickness 
, 
and 
my 
main 
memory 
of 
the 
landings ScrEv_landing
is 
throwing+up RelNScrEv_flight
down 
the 
back 
of 
my 
dad 
's 
neck 
. 
<end_of_story>_flight 
i 
made+sure UnrelEv_flight
that 
the 
doors 
to 
the 
airplane 
were UnrelEv_flight
all 
closed ScrEv_other_flight
and 
all 
the 
passengers 
were 
seated ScrEv_take_seat
and 
buckled ScrEv_buckle_seat_belt
in 
. 
after 
i 
went ScrEv_listen_crew
on 
the 
speaker 
and 
told ScrEv_take_off_preparations
everybody 
we 
were UnrelEv_flight
ready 
to 
depart ScrEv_take_off
, 
i 
carefully 
increased ScrEv_take_off_preparations
the 
speed 
of 
the 
plane 
as 
it 
bolted RelNScrEv_flight
down 
the 
runway 
. 
as 
the 
plane 
reached RelNScrEv_flight
maximum 
speed 
on 
the 
driveway 
, 
i 
slowly 
pulled ScrEv_take_off_preparations
on 
the 
lever 
to+lift ScrEv_take_off
the 
plane 
off 
the 
ground 
slowly 
. 
the 
plane 
eventually 
came UnrelEv_flight
completely 
off 
the 
runway 
and 
was RelNScrEv_flight
in 
flight 
. 
i 
pulled ScrEv_other_flight
the 
lever 
to 
lift ScrEv_other_flight
the 
wheels 
into 
the 
plane 
. 
i 
manuveured ScrEv_other_flight
the 
plane 
's 
direction 
with 
the 
pilot 
wheel 
to 
aim RelNScrEv_flight
it 
at 
the 
direction 
i 
wanted 
to 
go RelNScrEv_flight
. 
as 
soon 
as 
the 
plane 
was UnrelEv_flight
at 
a 
maximum 
flying 
height 
i 
put ScrEv_other_flight
the 
autopilot 
on 
and 
let UnrelEv_flight
the 
plane 
's 
computer 
fly 
it 
automatically 
. 
i 
sat+back ScrEv_spend_time_flight
and 
kept RelNScrEv_flight
watched 
over 
the 
data 
on 
the 
plane 
's 
dashboard 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
flight 
until 
we 
got RelNScrEv_flight
to 
where 
we 
were 
going UnrelEv_flight
. 
<end_of_story>_flight 
my 
cousin 
wanted UnrelEv_flight
me 
to 
visit UnrelEv_flight
him 
in 
florida 
over 
the 
summer 
and 
i 
needed 
to 
make UnrelEv_flight
a 
plan 
and 
book+a+flight Evoking_flight
to 
get RelNScrEv_flight
there 
. 
after 
searching RelNScrEv_flight
on 
the 
internet 
for 
a 
great 
price 
, 
i 
found UnrelEv_flight
one 
and 
booked ScrEv_get_ticket
it 
. 
the 
day 
of 
the 
flight 
i 
was UnrelEv_flight
a 
bit 
nervous 
as 
it 
had 
been UnrelEv_flight
a 
long 
time 
since 
i 
had 
flown+on+an+airplane Evoking_flight
. 
i 
boarded ScrEv_board_plane
along 
with 
the 
other 
passengers 
and 
realized UnrelEv_flight
that 
i 
had ScrEv_take_seat
a 
great 
window 
seat 
in 
a 
good 
location 
so 
i 
was 
n't 
crowded RelNScrEv_flight
in 
. 
after 
a 
very 
smooth 
take+off ScrEv_take_off
, 
the 
flight 
attendants 
brought ScrEv_other_flight
me 
something 
to 
drink ScrEv_spend_time_flight
and 
a 
snack 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_flight
a 
very 
smooth 
flight 
and 
about 
523 
hours 
later 
, 
i 
ended+up RelNScrEv_flight
at 
my 
destination 
. 
it 
all 
went RelNScrEv_flight
very 
nicely 
and 
i 
was UnrelEv_flight
happy 
to 
be RelNScrEv_flight
back 
on 
the 
ground 
. 
after 
we 
parked ScrEv_other_flight
at 
our 
terminal 
, 
we 
all 
orderly 
departed ScrEv_exit_plane
the 
airplane 
. 
after 
walking+down ScrEv_get_destination_airport
the 
tunnel 
leading UnrelEv_flight
into 
the 
airport 
, 
i 
saw ScrEv_meet_people
my 
family 
members 
waiting RelNScrEv_flight
for 
me 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_flight
a 
very 
pleasurable 
experience 
. 
<end_of_story>_flight 
i 
flew+in+an+airplane Evoking_flight
for 
the 
first 
time 
when 
i 
was UnrelEv_flight
eight 
years 
old 
. 
i 
was UnrelEv_flight
on 
my 
way 
to 
disney 
world 
. 
i 
was UnrelEv_flight
very 
nervous 
and 
was UnrelEv_flight
n't 
sure 
what 
to 
expect UnrelEv_flight
! 
i 
sat+down ScrEv_take_seat
next 
to 
my 
mom 
and 
she 
explained UnrelEv_flight
what 
would 
happen UnrelEv_flight
. 
she 
told UnrelEv_flight
me 
the 
flight 
attendant 
would 
talk ScrEv_listen_crew
to 
us 
about 
safety 
but 
that 
air 
travel 
was UnrelEv_flight
very 
safe 
and 
i 
should 
worry UnrelEv_flight
. 
then 
she 
told UnrelEv_flight
me 
that 
we 
were 
getting+ready ScrEv_take_off_preparations
to 
take+off ScrEv_take_off
! 
she 
told UnrelEv_flight
me 
we 
'd 
go+up UnrelEv_flight
in 
the 
air 
and 
then 
the 
wheels 
would 
retract ScrEv_other_flight
. 
i 
was+relieved UnrelEv_flight
to 
know UnrelEv_flight
what 
that 
sound 
was 
when 
i 
heard RelNScrEv_flight
it 
, 
otherwise 
i 
would 
have 
been UnrelEv_flight
nervous 
! 
it 
was UnrelEv_flight
a 
smooth 
flight 
and 
soon 
we 
were UnrelEv_flight
in 
florida 
! 
i 
noticed UnrelEv_flight
we 
were 
starting UnrelEv_flight
to 
go ScrEv_other_flight
lower 
. 
my 
mom 
gave UnrelEv_flight
me 
some 
gum 
to 
help UnrelEv_flight
relieve RelNScrEv_flight
the 
pressure 
in 
my 
ears 
. 
i 
heard UnrelEv_flight
the 
wheels 
come ScrEv_other_flight
back 
down 
and 
soon 
we 
had 
landed ScrEv_landing
! 
<end_of_story>_flight 
i 
was+excited UnrelEv_flight
to 
be 
going+to+cancun Evoking_flight
in 
two 
weeks 
. 
i 
brought ScrEv_get_ticket
my 
tickets 
a 
few 
months 
before 
, 
and 
when 
the 
day 
arrived UnrelEv_flight
, 
i 
simply 
printed+out RelNScrEv_flight
the 
ticket 
from 
my 
computer 
. 
i 
brought RelNScrEv_flight
my 
two 
suitcases 
filled ScrEv_pack_luggage
with 
clothes 
and 
necessities 
, 
along 
with 
my 
visa

other 
important

once 
i 
got ScrEv_get_airport
to 
the 
airport 
, 
i 
passed+by ScrEv_go_security_checks
security 
and 
they 
checked ScrEv_other_flight
my 
bags 
for 
anything 
that 
was UnrelEv_flight

dangerous 
.

i 
waited ScrEv_wait_boarding
at 
a 
terminal 
for 
an 
hour 
. 
they 
began UnrelEv_flight
to 
call 
for 
my 
plane 
and 
i 
got ScrEv_wait_boarding
on 
line 
. 
i 
gave ScrEv_present_ID/ticket
the 
lady 
my 
visa 
and 
ticket 
and 
i 
boarded ScrEv_board_plane
the 
airplane 
. 
i 
put ScrEv_stow_away_luggage
the 
luggage 
above 
my 
head 
in 
the 
luggage 
department 
and 
sat ScrEv_take_seat
down 
. 
my 
seat 
was UnrelEv_flight
next 
to 
a 
window 
so 
i 
was UnrelEv_flight
very 
happy 
about 
that 
. 
soon 
a 
person 
sat+down ScrEv_take_seat
next 
to 
me 
. 
we 
were 
told ScrEv_listen_crew
to 
eventually 
put ScrEv_buckle_seat_belt
our 
seat 
belts 
on 
as 
we 
were ScrEv_take_off_preparations
ready 
to 
fly RelNScrEv_flight
. 
we 
watched RelNScrEv_flight
a 
short 
video 
on 
what 
to 
do RelNScrEv_flight
in 
case 
we 
felt RelNScrEv_flight
some 
turbulence 
and 
what 
to 
do RelNScrEv_flight
in 
case 
of 
emergency 
. 
then 
the 
airplane 
lifted+off ScrEv_take_off
and 
i 
was UnrelEv_flight
scared RelNScrEv_flight
at 
first 
, 
i 
felt UnrelEv_flight
some 
shaking RelNScrEv_flight
but 
eventually 
we 
were ScrEv_take_off
in 
the 
air 
and 
everything 
was UnrelEv_flight
okay 
. 
eventually 
they 
began 
to 
serve ScrEv_other_flight
food 
. 
that 
was UnrelEv_flight
my 
favorite 
part 
. 
i 
love UnrelEv_flight
airplane 
food 
! 
<end_of_story>_flight 
last 
october 
i 
had UnrelEv_flight
the 
chance 
to 
fly Evoking_flight
from 
the 
usa 
back 
to 
england 
where 
i 
come+from UnrelEv_flight
to 
visit UnrelEv_flight
my 
mother 
and 
my 
brothers 
. 
there 
is UnrelEv_flight
an 
airport 
quite 
close 
to 
where 
i 
live UnrelEv_flight
so 
i 
purchased ScrEv_get_ticket
a 
ticket 
online 
to 
leave UnrelEv_flight
from 
that 
airport 
. 
when 
i 
got ScrEv_get_airport
to 
the 
airport 
i 
had 
to 
check+in ScrEv_check_in
first 
. 
that 
meant UnrelEv_flight
going ScrEv_go_check_in
to 
the 
line 
of 
check 
in 
desks 
so 
the 
personnel 
there 
could 
give ScrEv_get_ticket
me 
my 
boarding 
tickets 
-lrb- 
which 
allow UnrelEv_flight
me 
onto 
the 
plane 
-rrb- 
, 
and 
take RelNScrEv_flight
my 
suitcases 
off 
me 
to 
put RelNScrEv_flight
on 
the 
plane 
. 
the 
suitcases 
were 
weighed ScrEv_check_luggage
first 
to 
make+sure UnrelEv_flight
they 
were UnrelEv_flight
not 
too 
heavy 
and 
were 
sent+back RelNScrEv_flight
behind 
the 
check 
in 
desks 
on 
a 
long 
conveyor 
belt 
. 
once 
they 
had 
gone UnrelEv_flight
all 
i 
could 
do UnrelEv_flight
was 
hope UnrelEv_flight
they 
ended+up RelNScrEv_flight
on 
the 
same 
plane 
as 
me 
! 
when 
i 
had UnrelEv_flight
my 
boarding 
pass 
i 
was 
told UnrelEv_flight
to 
go+through ScrEv_go_security_checks
security 
where 
you 
are 
screened ScrEv_go_security_checks
to 
make+sure UnrelEv_flight
you 
are 
not 
carrying RelNScrEv_flight
anything 
illegal 
such 
as 
weapons 
or 
sharp 
objects 
. 
in 
some 
airports 
now 
, 
like 
the 
one 
near 
me 
, 
they 
use RelNScrEv_flight
a 
body 
scanning 
machine 
that 
you 
walk+into RelNScrEv_flight
, 
a 
bit 
like 
a 
shower 
cubicle 
. 
i 
was 
called RelNScrEv_flight
into 
this 
scanner 
and 
told UnrelEv_flight
to 
place RelNScrEv_flight
my 
feet 
on 
some 
footprints 
painted UnrelEv_flight
in 
the 
cubicle 
, 
and 
then 
i 
had 
to 
raise RelNScrEv_flight
my 
arms 
above 
my 
head 
. 
when 
i 
was UnrelEv_flight
in 
position 
the 
machine 
turned+on UnrelEv_flight
and 
scanned RelNScrEv_flight
me 
quickly 
and 
then 
i 
was 
told UnrelEv_flight
i 
could 
step+out RelNScrEv_flight
. 
while 
this 
was 
going+on UnrelEv_flight
, 
my 
hand 
luggage 
-lrb- 
the 
bag 
i 
took RelNScrEv_flight
on 
the 
plane 
with 
me 
-rrb- 
was 
placed ScrEv_check_luggage
on 
a 
conveyor 
belt 
and 
was 
x-rayed ScrEv_check_luggage
by 
airport 
security 
people 
. 
when 
they 
were 
satisfied UnrelEv_flight
everything 
i 
had+was UnrelEv_flight
legal 
and 
safe 
i 
was 
allowed UnrelEv_flight
to 
proceed ScrEv_find_terminal
to 
the 
gate 
, 
which 
is UnrelEv_flight
where 
the 
plane 
leaves ScrEv_take_off
from 
. 
at 
the 
gate 
i 
waited ScrEv_wait_boarding
to 
be 
called ScrEv_listen_call
onto 
the 
airplane 
and 
finally 
walked ScrEv_get_plane
down 
a 
long 
gangway 
and 
into 
the 
plane 
. 
my 
seat 
was UnrelEv_flight
next 
to 
the 
window 
and 
i 
had UnrelEv_flight
my 
own 
television 
screen 
in 
front 
of 
me 
which 
was 
showing ScrEv_spend_time_flight
movies 
, 
or 
i 
could 
turn UnrelEv_flight
it 
to 
a 
map 
which 
showed RelNScrEv_flight
where 
the 
plane 
was 
flying+over RelNScrEv_flight
. 
there 
was UnrelEv_flight
a 
bright 
red 
blanket 
and 
a 
white 
pillow 
on 
the 
seat 
as 
it 
is UnrelEv_flight
a 
very 
long 
flight 
, 
523 
hours 
, 
and 
people 
generally 
go UnrelEv_flight
to 
sleep ScrEv_spend_time_flight
. 
the 
steward 
brought RelNScrEv_flight
everyone 
headphones 
so 
we 
could 
listen ScrEv_spend_time_flight
to 
the 
television 
, 
we 
had 
to 
watch RelNScrEv_flight
the 
stewards 
give ScrEv_other_flight
a 
safety 
demonstration 
so 
we 
knew UnrelEv_flight
what 
to 
do RelNScrEv_flight
in 
an 
emergency 
, 
and 
then 
we 
all 
buckled ScrEv_buckle_seat_belt
our 
seat 
belts 
to 
get 
ready 
for 
take+off ScrEv_take_off
. 
take+off ScrEv_take_off
was UnrelEv_flight
noisy 
but 
fast 
and 
it 
was UnrelEv_flight
very 
exciting UnrelEv_flight
to 
look ScrEv_spend_time_flight
out 
of 
the 
window 
and 
see UnrelEv_flight
the 
ground 
getting UnrelEv_flight
further 
and 
further 
away 
until 
all 
i 
could 
see UnrelEv_flight
was 
clouds 
. 
<end_of_story>_flight 
i 
was RelNScrEv_flight
a 
little 
nervous 
about 
my 
plane 
trip 
, 
but 
my 
friend 
was 
coming UnrelEv_flight
with 
me 
, 
and 
that 
made UnrelEv_flight
me 
feel UnrelEv_flight
a 
little 
better 
. 
we 
went ScrEv_get_airport
to 
the 
airport 
, 
and 
gave ScrEv_check_in
our 
bags 
to 
an 
attendant 
to 
be 
checked ScrEv_check_luggage
onto 
the 
plane 
. 
we 
went+through ScrEv_go_security_checks
the 
security 
station 
to 
make+sure UnrelEv_flight
everything 
was UnrelEv_flight
safe 
, 
then 
we 
were UnrelEv_flight
ready 
to 
go ScrEv_find_terminal
to 
our 
terminal 
. 
we 
were UnrelEv_flight
there 
a 
little 
early 
, 
so 
we 
grabbed UnrelEv_flight
a 
bite 
to 
eat RelNScrEv_flight
at 
the 
restaurant 
while 
we 
waited ScrEv_wait_boarding
. 
when 
the 
plane 
arrived ScrEv_other_flight
, 
we 
gave ScrEv_present_ID/ticket
the 
attendant 
our 
tickets 
and 
got ScrEv_board_plane
on 
the 
plane 
. 
once 
we 
were 
all 
seated ScrEv_take_seat
, 
the 
flight 
attendant 
went ScrEv_listen_crew
over 
some 
safety 
rules 
with 
us 
before 
we 
took+off ScrEv_take_off
. 
i 
watched ScrEv_spend_time_flight
out 
the 
window 
as 
we 
got RelNScrEv_flight
higher 
and 
higher 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_flight
a 
little 
scary 
, 
but 
kind 
of 
fun 
, 
too 
. 
the 
flight 
attendant 
came UnrelEv_flight
by 
and 
gave ScrEv_spend_time_flight
us 
all 
a 
little 
snack 
during 
the 
flight 
. 
by 
the 
time 
we 
landed ScrEv_landing
, 
i 
was UnrelEv_flight
n't 
scared RelNScrEv_flight
anymore 
. 
we 
went UnrelEv_flight
to 
get ScrEv_retrieve_luggage
our 
bags 
from 
the 
big 
conveyer 
belt 
and 
were ScrEv_leave_airport
soon 
on 
our 
way 
from 
the 
airport 
. 
<end_of_story>_flight 
the 
other 
day 
i 
went+for+a+ride+in+an+airplane Evoking_flight
. 
i 
drove ScrEv_get_airport
to 
the 
airport 
with 
my 
significant 
other 
and 
we 
took RelNScrEv_flight
our 
bags 
. 
we 
stood ScrEv_wait
in 
line 
to 
check ScrEv_check_in
our 
bags 
and 
receive ScrEv_get_ticket
our 
tickets 
. 
we 
also 
had 
to 
go+through ScrEv_go_security_checks
a 
security 
checkpoint 
. 
once 
on 
the 
plane 
you 
wait RelNScrEv_flight
a 
little 
while 
for 
everyone 
to 
be 
seated ScrEv_take_seat
and 
then 
the 
pilot 
announces ScrEv_listen_crew
that 
the 
plain 
will 
be 
taking ScrEv_take_off
off 
. 
when 
the 
plane 
is 
going+up RelNScrEv_flight
into 
the 
air 
it 
can 
feel 
kind 
of 
funny 
but 
once 
the 
plane 
reaches RelNScrEv_flight
a 
certain 
height 
it 
is UnrelEv_flight
usually 
smooth 
sailing RelNScrEv_flight
. 
there 
can 
sometimes 
be RelNScrEv_flight
some 
turbulence 
but 
there 
is UnrelEv_flight
usually 
just 
a 
smooth 
ride 
. 
sometimes 
a 
flight 
attendant 
asks RelNScrEv_flight
you 
if 
you 
want UnrelEv_flight
anything 
like 
something 
to 
drink ScrEv_spend_time_flight
or 
eat ScrEv_spend_time_flight
. 
there 
is UnrelEv_flight
a 
bathroom 
on 
the 
plane 
if 
you 
have 
to 
go UnrelEv_flight
and 
you 
can 
even 
shave UnrelEv_flight
in 
there 
. 
once 
you 
get+off ScrEv_exit_plane
the 
plane 
you 
grab ScrEv_retrieve_luggage
your 
bags 
and 
off 
you 
can 
go ScrEv_leave_airport
safely 
. 
<end_of_story>_flight 
i 
like UnrelEv_flight
traveling+by+plane Evoking_flight
. 
i 
love UnrelEv_flight
the 
sound 
of 
the 
big 
metal 
bird 
racing+off RelNScrEv_flight
the 
runway 
. 
i 
have 
flown RelNScrEv_flight
when 
the 
skies 
have 
been UnrelEv_flight
blue 
and 
other 
times 
the 
sky 
has 
been UnrelEv_flight
gray 
. 
i 
' 
ve 
met UnrelEv_flight
many 
people 
traveling UnrelEv_flight
from 
different 
places 
on 
the 
globe 
. 
the 
one 
thing 
i 
will 
never 
understand UnrelEv_flight
is 
why 
the 
flight 
attendants 
only 
give RelNScrEv_flight
you 
a 
half 
a 
can 
of 
soda 
and 
small 
bag 
of 
peanuts 
. 
i 
love UnrelEv_flight
the 
safety 
show 
the 
flight 
attendants 
put+on ScrEv_other_flight
in 
case 
there 
' 
s RelNScrEv_flight
an 
emergency 
. 
however 
, 
i 
hate UnrelEv_flight
turbulence 
because 
it 
sounds RelNScrEv_flight
like 
the 
plane 
is 
banging RelNScrEv_flight
into 
other 
planes 
in 
the 
sky 
. 
one 
time 
i 
flew RelNScrEv_flight
on 
a 
plane 
with 
only 
nine 
other 
passengers 
. 
i 
had RelNScrEv_flight
a 
seat 
to 
myself 
. 
i 
stretched+out ScrEv_spend_time_flight
like 
i 
was UnrelEv_flight
at 
home 
and 
watched ScrEv_spend_time_flight
a 
movie 
. 
undisturbed 
! 
one 
day 
i 
hope UnrelEv_flight
to 
have UnrelEv_flight
a 
concession 
stand 
in 
an 
airport 
. 
they 
seemed UnrelEv_flight
to 
make RelNScrEv_flight
a 
lot 
of 
money 
off 
people 
flying RelNScrEv_flight
. 
<end_of_story>_flight 
the 
last 
time 
that 
i 
flew+in+an+airplane Evoking_flight
i 
bought ScrEv_get_ticket
a 
ticket 
to 
new 
orleans 
. 
i 
bought ScrEv_get_ticket
the 
ticket 
early 
to 
make+sure UnrelEv_flight
it 
was UnrelEv_flight
as 
cheap 
as 
possible 
. 
then 
i 
started UnrelEv_flight
packing ScrEv_pack_luggage
my 
bags 
to 
make+sure UnrelEv_flight
i 
had UnrelEv_flight
everything 
that 
i 
needed UnrelEv_flight
for 
my 
trip 
. 
i 
also 
planned UnrelEv_flight
to 
figure RelNScrEv_flight
out 
how 
i 
was 
going 
to 
arrive ScrEv_get_airport
at 
the 
airport 
. 
on 
the 
day 
of 
the 
flight 
, 
once 
i 
arrived ScrEv_get_airport
at 
the 
airport 
, 
i 
checked ScrEv_check_luggage
one 
of 
my 
bags 
and 
proceeded ScrEv_go_security_checks
to 
the 
tsa 
terminal 
. 
at 
the 
tsa 
the 
check ScrEv_present_ID/ticket
your 
id 
and 
make+sure UnrelEv_flight
you 
do 
n't 
bring RelNScrEv_flight
anything 
that 
is 
not 
allowed RelNScrEv_flight
on 
the 
plane 
. 
i 
was 
not 
bringing RelNScrEv_flight
anything 
that 
was 
not 
allowed RelNScrEv_flight
so 
i 
got+in RelNScrEv_flight
with 
no 
problems 
. 
after 
that 
i 
found ScrEv_find_terminal
my 
gate 
, 
waited ScrEv_wait_boarding
a 
bit 
and 
boarded ScrEv_board_plane
the 
plane 
. 
on 
the 
plane 
i 
looked+out ScrEv_spend_time_flight
of 
the 
window 
and 
took ScrEv_spend_time_flight
some 
naps 
. 
<end_of_story>_flight 
i 
waited ScrEv_wait
in 
the 
airport 
until 
it 
was 
time 
for 
the 
passengers 
to 
board+the+plane Evoking_flight
. 
i 
went+up ScrEv_board_plane
with 
the 
other 
passengers 
and 
stood ScrEv_wait_boarding
in 
line 
. 
we 
all 
had 
to 
show ScrEv_present_boarding_pass
our 
boarding 
passes 
at 
the 
gate 
. 
once 
we 
'd 
done ScrEv_present_boarding_pass
that 
, 
we 
were 
allowed RelNScrEv_flight
to 
board ScrEv_board_plane
a 
plane 
. 
we 
all 
walked+down ScrEv_get_plane
a 
short 
hallway 
that 
connected RelNScrEv_flight
the 
airport 
to 
the 
plane 
itself 
. 
as 
we 
walked+in ScrEv_board_plane
the 
door 
of 
the 
plane 
, 
a 
stewardess 
and 
a 
pilot 
both 
said RelNScrEv_flight
hello 
to 
us 
. 
i 
walked+down ScrEv_other_flight
the 
narrow 
aisle 
of 
the 
plane 
until 
i 
found RelNScrEv_flight
my 
seat 
number 
, 
which 
was UnrelEv_flight
near 
the 
plane 
's 
right 
wing 
. 
i 
put ScrEv_stow_away_luggage
the 
bag 
i 
was 
carrying UnrelEv_flight
in 
an 
overhead 
compartment 
near 
my 
seat 
and 
sat+down ScrEv_take_seat
next 
to 
the 
window 
. 
soon 
the 
plane 
was 
taxiing ScrEv_take_off_preparations
to 
take+off ScrEv_take_off
, 
which 
means UnrelEv_flight
that 
it 
was UnrelEv_flight
essentially 
driving ScrEv_take_off_preparations
to 
the 
runway 
. 
once 
there 
, 
the 
plane 
got ScrEv_take_off_preparations
the 
go 
ahead 
to 
take+off ScrEv_take_off
. 
it 
started UnrelEv_flight
going ScrEv_take_off_preparations
really 
, 
really 
fast 
, 
and 
then 
suddenly 
it 
was ScrEv_take_off
off 
the 
ground 
and 
quickly 
gaining RelNScrEv_flight
elevation 
. 
i 
looked ScrEv_spend_time_flight
out 
the 
window 
and 
saw UnrelEv_flight
the 
airport 
and 
the 
neighborhood 
nearby 
, 
the 
streets 
and 
cars 
and 
fields 
all 
get UnrelEv_flight
smaller 
and 
smaller 
, 
until 
they 
did 
n't 
look UnrelEv_flight
real 
anymore 
. 
my 
flight 
lasted RelNScrEv_flight
a 
few 
hours 
. 
during 
that 
time 
the 
stewardesses 
passed ScrEv_other_flight
around 
sodas 
, 
and 
people 
who 
wanted UnrelEv_flight
to 
eat ScrEv_spend_time_flight
ordered RelNScrEv_flight
things 
like 
bags 
of 
peanuts 
. 
i 
ate ScrEv_spend_time_flight
a 
granola 
bar 
i 
'd 
taken UnrelEv_flight
with 
me 
and 
watched ScrEv_spend_time_flight
part 
of 
a 
movie 
that 
they 
were 
showing RelNScrEv_flight
. 
finally 
it 
was UnrelEv_flight
time 
to 
land ScrEv_landing
. 
the 
plane 
started UnrelEv_flight
to 
descend ScrEv_landing
, 
more 
and 
more 
. 
finally 
its 
wheels 
touched RelNScrEv_flight
the 
runway 
. 
it 
taxied ScrEv_landing
for 
a 
while 
and 
then 
finally 
came ScrEv_landing
to 
a 
stop 
. 
people 
got+up ScrEv_other_flight
and 
got ScrEv_other_flight
their 
bags 
from 
the 
overhead 
compartments 
. 
the 
aisle 
was UnrelEv_flight
very 
crowded RelNScrEv_flight
at 
this 
point 
. 
when 
the 
doors 
were 
opened ScrEv_other_flight
we 
all 
got+out ScrEv_exit_plane
of 
the 
plane 
and 
made ScrEv_get_destination_airport
our 
way 
to 
the 
airport 
and 
, 
from 
there 
, 
to 
wherever 
we 
all 
were 
going UnrelEv_flight
. 
<end_of_story>_flight 
i 
took+a+trip+to+the+beach+by+plane Evoking_flight
. 
i 
arrived ScrEv_get_airport
at 
the 
airport 
early 
to 
go+through ScrEv_check_in
the 
checkout 
process 
. 
i 
decided UnrelEv_flight
not 
to 
check ScrEv_check_luggage
any 
bags 
, 
so 
i 
simply 
got ScrEv_get_ticket
my 
ticket 
and 
then 
went+through ScrEv_go_security_checks
the 
security 
line 
. 
after 
security 
i 
went ScrEv_find_terminal
to 
my 
terminal 
to 
wait ScrEv_wait_boarding
for 
the 
plane 
to 
board ScrEv_board_plane
. 
once 
we 
went+through UnrelEv_flight
the 
boarding ScrEv_board_plane
procedure 
i 
sat ScrEv_take_seat
at 
my 
seat 
next 
to 
the 
window 
. 
beside 
me 
was UnrelEv_flight
an 
older 
lady 
who 
made UnrelEv_flight
small 
talk 
with 
me 
until 
the 
plane 
took+off ScrEv_take_off
-lrb- 
even 
talking UnrelEv_flight
through 
the 
safety 
speech 
given ScrEv_listen_crew
by 
the 
flight 
attendants 
before 
we 
took+off ScrEv_take_off
-rrb- 
. 
she 
quickly 
fell+asleep ScrEv_spend_time_flight
once 
we 
were RelNScrEv_flight
in 
the 
air 
though 
. 
i 
observed ScrEv_spend_time_flight
the 
land 
below 
and 
the 
clouds 
for 
awhile 
before 
i 
too 
fell+asleep ScrEv_spend_time_flight
. 
i 
awoke ScrEv_spend_time_flight
to 
the 
sound 
of 
the 
flight 
attendant 
informing ScrEv_listen_crew
us 
the 
plane 
would 
soon 
be 
landing ScrEv_landing
. 
i 
almost 
barfed RelNScrEv_flight
as 
we 
made 
our 
decent 
, 
but 
managed UnrelEv_flight
to 
hold RelNScrEv_flight
it 
in 
. 
once 
we 
landed ScrEv_landing
i 
departed ScrEv_exit_plane
the 
plane 
with 
the 
other 
passengers 
. 
<end_of_story>_flight 
i 
buy ScrEv_get_ticket
tickets 
far 
ahead 
, 
to 
save UnrelEv_flight
money 
. 
when 
the 
day 
approaches UnrelEv_flight
, 
i 
pack ScrEv_pack_luggage
carefully 
, 
excluding UnrelEv_flight
oversized 
toiletries 
, 
liquids 
, 
explosives 
and 
anything 
else 
likely 
to 
be 
viewed RelNScrEv_flight
as 
contraband 
. 
i 
also 
remind UnrelEv_flight
myself 
not 
to 
joke UnrelEv_flight
about 
this 
stuff 
at 
the 
airport 
, 
and 
to 
be UnrelEv_flight
absolutely 
cooperative 
. 
i 
wear UnrelEv_flight
slip-on 
shoes 
, 
arrive ScrEv_get_airport
an 
hour 
early 
, 
get ScrEv_wait
in 
line 
and 
do UnrelEv_flight
as 
i 
am 
told UnrelEv_flight
. 
usually 
this 
means UnrelEv_flight
a 
brief 
scan 
and 
luggage 
overlook ScrEv_check_luggage
. 
it 
's UnrelEv_flight
much 
like 
crossing UnrelEv_flight
a 
border 
, 
and 
only 
slightly 
more 
intense 
. 
then 
i 
wait ScrEv_wait_boarding
on 
the 
other 
side 
of 
the 
checkpoint 
, 
with 
everyone 
else 
. 
i 
am 
careful 
to 
bring RelNScrEv_flight
snacks 
and 
slippers 
in 
my 
carry 
on 
luggage 
, 
and 
i 
read ScrEv_spend_time_flight
rather 
than 
paying RelNScrEv_flight
for 
entertainment 
. 
the 
flying RelNScrEv_flight
etiquette 
of 
coach 
class 
is UnrelEv_flight
to 
leave RelNScrEv_flight
fellow 
passengers 
alone 
, 
and 
i 
do UnrelEv_flight
that 
. 
i 
also 
avoid RelNScrEv_flight
those 
tiny 
bathrooms 
if 
i 
can 
, 
because 
i 
feel UnrelEv_flight
confined RelNScrEv_flight
enough 
just 
being UnrelEv_flight
on 
the 
plane 
. 
<end_of_story>_flight 
i 
was UnrelEv_flight
so 
excited UnrelEv_flight
to 
go+on+my+first+trip+to+florida+by+airplane Evoking_flight
. 
i 
made+sure UnrelEv_flight
to 
buy ScrEv_get_ticket
a 
window 
seat 
so 
i 
could 
see RelNScrEv_flight
the 
beautiful 
view 
from 
high 
up 
in 
the 
sky 
. 
i 
listened ScrEv_listen_crew
carefully 
to 
the 
flight 
attendant 
as 
she 
gave ScrEv_listen_crew
her 
speech 
about 
safety 
precautions 
. 
after 
she 
finished UnrelEv_flight
the 
pilot 
got+on RelNScrEv_flight
the 
loud 
speaker 
and 
informed ScrEv_listen_crew
us 
that 
we 
will 
be 
taking+off ScrEv_take_off
shortly 
. 
he 
told ScrEv_listen_crew
us 
what 
time 
we 
will 
be 
landing ScrEv_landing
in 
florida 
and 
even 
the 
temperature 
it 
will 
be UnrelEv_flight
when 
we 
landed ScrEv_landing
. 
he 
then 
told ScrEv_listen_crew
us 
to 
buckle ScrEv_buckle_seat_belt
our 
seat 
belt 
and 
turn+off ScrEv_other_flight
any 
electronic 
devices 
we 
may 
have UnrelEv_flight
with 
us 
. 
a 
couple 
minutes 
later 
the 
engine 
came ScrEv_take_off_preparations
to 
life 
and 
the 
plane 
started UnrelEv_flight
moving ScrEv_take_off_preparations
towards 
the 
runway 
. 
when 
it 
reach ScrEv_take_off_preparations
the 
runway 
it 
started UnrelEv_flight
to 
speed+up ScrEv_take_off_preparations
very 
fast 
and 
after 
a 
minute 
i 
felt UnrelEv_flight
the 
plane 
lift+off ScrEv_take_off
of 
the 
ground 
. 
i 
looked ScrEv_spend_time_flight
out 
the 
window 
and 
saw 
us 
leaving RelNScrEv_flight
the 
ground 
. 
when 
we 
reach RelNScrEv_flight
our 
cruising 
altitude 
the 
pilot 
informed ScrEv_listen_crew
us 
it 
was UnrelEv_flight
now 
safe 
for 
us 
to 
take+off ScrEv_other_flight
our 
seat 
belts 
. 
i 
looked ScrEv_spend_time_flight
out 
the 
window 
and 
found UnrelEv_flight
myself 
amazed UnrelEv_flight
as 
we 
soared RelNScrEv_flight
over 
the 
clouds 
. 
<end_of_story>_flight 
after 
a 
couple 
days 
from 
ordering+the+plane+tickets+online Evoking_flight
. 
i 
drove+over ScrEv_get_airport
to 
the 
airport 
which 
took UnrelEv_flight
about 
523 
minutes 
. 
upon 
arriving UnrelEv_flight
there 
i 
parked ScrEv_other_flight
my 
car 
and 
walked ScrEv_get_airport
inside 
the 
airport 
. 
i 
had 
to 
go+through ScrEv_go_security_checks
security 
first 
which 
checked ScrEv_go_security_checks
everything 
, 
and 
i 
walked ScrEv_find_terminal
to 
find 
the 
wing 
where 
my 
assigned RelNScrEv_flight
airplane 
was 
at 
. 
once 
i 
found ScrEv_find_terminal
it 
, 
i 
drop+off ScrEv_other_flight
my 
luggage 
and 
go UnrelEv_flight
to 
the 
clerk 
with 
my 
plane 
ticket 
. 
after 
she 
inspects ScrEv_present_ID/ticket
it 
, 
i 
go ScrEv_board_plane
on 
the 
airplane 
and 
sit ScrEv_take_seat
onto 
my 
assigned RelNScrEv_flight
seat 
. 
since 
this 
was UnrelEv_flight
my 
first 
ride 
, 
i 
decided UnrelEv_flight
to 
not 
sit UnrelEv_flight
near 
the 
window 
in 
order 
to 
prevent UnrelEv_flight
getting+sick RelNScrEv_flight
. 
after 
the 
plane 
filled+up RelNScrEv_flight
with 
more 
people 
, 
we 
ended+up UnrelEv_flight
taking+off ScrEv_take_off
. 
during 
the 
ride 
everyone 
was UnrelEv_flight
very 
quite 
and 
there 
was UnrelEv_flight
a 
movie 
playing ScrEv_spend_time_flight
during 
the 
ride 
. 
after 
523 
hours 
the 
plane 
arrived ScrEv_get_destination_airport
to 
the 
next 
airport 
and 
i 
got+off ScrEv_exit_plane
. 
i 
picked+up ScrEv_retrieve_luggage
my 
luggage 
, 
and 
met+up ScrEv_meet_people
with 
my 
friend 
who 
met ScrEv_meet_people
me 
there 
. 
<end_of_story>_flight 
i 
made+sure UnrelEv_flight
i 
had UnrelEv_flight
my 
ticket 
in 
advance 
and 
checked RelNScrEv_flight
to 
make+sure UnrelEv_flight
my 
flight 
was 
not 
canceled RelNScrEv_flight
. 
i 
had 
pre-packed ScrEv_pack_luggage
what 
i 
needed UnrelEv_flight
and 
doubled 
checked RelNScrEv_flight
the 
list 
to 
make 
sure 
that 
all 
my 
items 
were 
approved UnrelEv_flight
. 
then 
, 
i 
arrived ScrEv_get_airport
at 
the 
airport 
about 
one 
and 
a 
half 
hours 
early 
. 
i 
made+sure UnrelEv_flight
to 
go+through ScrEv_go_security_checks
security 
first 
, 
since 
there 
were UnrelEv_flight
long 
lines 
for 
that 
. 
i 
had 
to 
take+off ScrEv_go_security_checks
my 
shoes 
and 
put ScrEv_go_security_checks
my 
bags 
through 
an 
x-ray 
. 
after 
i 
was 
done UnrelEv_flight
, 
i 
put ScrEv_check_luggage
my 
luggage 
in 
the 
correct 
area 
so 
it 
could 
be 
loaded RelNScrEv_flight
on 
the 
plane 
. 
i 
waited ScrEv_wait_boarding
until 
my 
plane 
was 
ready 
to 
board ScrEv_board_plane
and 
showed ScrEv_present_boarding_pass
the 
flight 
attendant 
my 
boarding 
pass 
. 
i 
stayed UnrelEv_flight
quietly 
on 
the 
plane 
and 
made+sure UnrelEv_flight
i 
was UnrelEv_flight
in 
my 
assigned RelNScrEv_flight
seat 
. 
it 
can 
be UnrelEv_flight
crowded 
and 
boring 
, 
so 
i 
read ScrEv_spend_time_flight
my 
book 
on 
the 
flight 
. 
i 
made 
sure 
to 
listen ScrEv_listen_crew
to 
the 
flight 
attendants 
when 
they 
had UnrelEv_flight
an 
announcement 
to 
make UnrelEv_flight
. 
<end_of_story>_flight 
flying+in+an+airplane Evoking_flight
for 
the 
first 
time 
can 
be UnrelEv_flight
a 
wonderful 
experience 
. 
once 
you 
are 
all 
settled ScrEv_take_seat
into 
your 
seat 
you 
will 
hear ScrEv_listen_crew
all 
the 
safety 
messages 
. 
these 
tend 
to 
be UnrelEv_flight
pretty 
boring 
but 
every 
now 
and 
then 
an 
airline 
will 
give UnrelEv_flight
the 
safety 
messages 
some 
new 
twist 
or 
humor 
. 
during 
the 
safety 
briefing 
, 
the 
plane 
will 
be 
heading ScrEv_take_off_preparations
towards 
the 
runaway 
for 
takeoff ScrEv_take_off
. 
once 
the 
plane 
is UnrelEv_flight
ready 
for 
takeoff ScrEv_take_off
, 
all 
the 
flight 
attendants 
will 
sit ScrEv_take_seat
and 
buckle ScrEv_buckle_seat_belt
themselves 
in 
. 
next 
comes UnrelEv_flight
the 
best 
part 
- 
the 
plane 
will 
accelerate ScrEv_take_off
very 
quickly 
from 
sitting UnrelEv_flight
to 
flying ScrEv_other_flight
in 
the 
air 
. 
the 
process 
barely 
takes UnrelEv_flight
a 
minute 
but 
you 
'll 
feel UnrelEv_flight
the 
rush 
from 
going 
so 
fast 
. 
you 
'll 
continue 
feeling UnrelEv_flight
the 
effects 
until 
the 
plane 
gets ScrEv_other_flight
high 
enough 
into 
the 
air 
to 
reach ScrEv_other_flight
a 
cruising 
altitude 
. 
once 
this 
height 
is 
reached ScrEv_other_flight
, 
you 
will 
barely 
notice UnrelEv_flight
you 
're UnrelEv_flight
in 
the 
air 
unless 
you 
look ScrEv_spend_time_flight
outside 
the 
window 
. 
<end_of_story>_flight 
i 
waited ScrEv_wait_boarding
in 
a 
seating 
area 
near 
the 
gate 
at 
the 
airport 
. 
i 
could 
see UnrelEv_flight
the 
huge 
jetliner 
out 
the 
window 
. 
i 
looked RelNScrEv_flight
at 
my 
ticket 
and 
saw UnrelEv_flight
that 
i 
was UnrelEv_flight
in 
group 
523 
. 
when 
the 
gate 
attendant 
called ScrEv_listen_call
my 
number 
i 
showed ScrEv_present_boarding_pass
her 
my 
ticket 
and 
boarded ScrEv_board_plane
the 
plane 
. 
i 
found RelNScrEv_flight
my 
seat 
, 
22d 
, 
and 
sat+down ScrEv_take_seat
, 
putting ScrEv_stow_away_luggage
the 
small 
bag 
i 
had 
packed ScrEv_pack_luggage
under 
the 
seat 
in 
front 
of 
me 
. 
after 
everyone 
was UnrelEv_flight
on 
the 
plane 
they 
shut RelNScrEv_flight
the 
door 
. 
the 
flight 
attendant 
made ScrEv_listen_crew
a 
few 
announcements 
and 
i 
buckled ScrEv_buckle_seat_belt
myself 
in 
. 
the 
plane 
pulled ScrEv_take_off_preparations
away 
from 
the 
gate 
and 
taxied ScrEv_take_off_preparations
to 
a 
runway 
. 
we 
sat ScrEv_take_off_preparations
on 
the 
runway 
for 
a 
few 
minutes 
before 
we 
were 
given UnrelEv_flight
approval 
to 
take+off ScrEv_take_off
. 
i 
was 
pushed+back UnrelEv_flight
in 
my 
seat 
and 
we 
accelerated ScrEv_take_off
down 
the 
runway 
. 
the 
nose 
lifted ScrEv_take_off
and 
we 
were UnrelEv_flight
in 
the 
air 
. 
during 
the 
flight 
i 
got ScrEv_spend_time_flight
a 
drink 
. 
one 
hour 
later 
, 
the 
plane 
set+down ScrEv_landing
in 
cleveland 
. 
success 
! 
<end_of_story>_flight 
as 
i 
walked ScrEv_get_airport
in 
through 
the 
sliding 
glass 
door 
i 
could 
feel UnrelEv_flight
my 
excitement 
rising+up UnrelEv_flight
in 
my 
body 
. 
you 
see 
i 
had 
just 
entered ScrEv_get_airport
the 
airport 
and 
this 
was UnrelEv_flight
my 
first 
time 
ever 
flying Evoking_flight
! 
i 
went ScrEv_go_check_in
over 
to 
the 
self 
check 
in 
with 
my 
mom 
and 
typed+in RelNScrEv_flight
my 
ticket 
number 
and 
checked ScrEv_check_luggage
my 
bag 
. 
after 
receiving ScrEv_get_ticket
my 
tickets 
i 
went+down RelNScrEv_flight
to 
the 
dreaded UnrelEv_flight
security 
check 
point 
. 
to 
my 
surprise 
it 
was UnrelEv_flight
not 
as 
bad 
as 
i 
had 
thought UnrelEv_flight
. 
even 
though 
the 
line 
was UnrelEv_flight
long 
it 
seemed UnrelEv_flight
to 
move RelNScrEv_flight
quickly 
. 
i 
showed ScrEv_present_ID/ticket
my 
ticket 
and 
id 
to 
the 
agent 
and 
then 
kind 
of 
followed UnrelEv_flight
what 
everyone 
else 
was 
doing UnrelEv_flight
. 
i 
grabbed ScrEv_go_security_checks
a 
bin 
and 
took+off ScrEv_go_security_checks
my 
shoes 
and 
put ScrEv_go_security_checks
my 
book 
bag 
on 
the 
rolling 
belt 
as 
well 
. 
i 
emptied ScrEv_go_security_checks
all 
my 
pockets 
and 
walked+through ScrEv_go_security_checks
the 
metal 
detector 
. 
to 
my 
surprise 
it 
did 
not 
beep RelNScrEv_flight
, 
but 
my 
mom 
was UnrelEv_flight
not 
so 
lucky 
. 
she 
had 
to 
get 
waved ScrEv_go_security_checks
by 
that 
wand 
thing 
and 
they 
discovered UnrelEv_flight
it 
was UnrelEv_flight
her 
belt 
buckle 
setting RelNScrEv_flight
it 
off 
. 
after 
we 
grabbed RelNScrEv_flight
our 
things 
and 
i 
got UnrelEv_flight
a 
book 
to 
read ScrEv_spend_time_flight
on 
the 
flight 
from 
a 
newsstand 
in 
the 
airport 
. 
we 
found ScrEv_find_terminal
our 
gate 
and 
they 
called ScrEv_listen_call
us 
in 
groups 
. 
we 
got ScrEv_wait
in 
line 
and 
handed ScrEv_present_boarding_pass
the 
attendant 
our 
tickets 
and 
boarded ScrEv_board_plane
the 
plane 
. 
i 
got ScrEv_take_seat
the 
window 
seat 
and 
was UnrelEv_flight
super 
excited 
of 
getting 
to 
see ScrEv_spend_time_flight
out 
the 
window 
. 
the 
woman 
gave ScrEv_listen_crew
us 
the 
safety 
demo 
and 
we 
were UnrelEv_flight
off 
! 
i 
was UnrelEv_flight
a 
little 
nervous 
on 
take 
off 
but 
after 
that 
it 
was UnrelEv_flight
smooth 
sailing 
. 
two 
diet 
cokes 
and 
three 
hours 
later 
we 
arrived ScrEv_landing
in 
chicago 
! 
<end_of_story>_flight 
some 
people 
view UnrelEv_flight
flying+in+an+airplane Evoking_flight
as 
a 
chore 
, 
but 
i 
truly 
enjoy UnrelEv_flight
it 
. 
finding ScrEv_get_ticket
the 
best 
fare 
and 
route 
to 
meet UnrelEv_flight
your 
needs 
is 
a 
very 
important 
first 
step 
,

i 
usually 
utilize UnrelEv_flight
various 
travel 
websites 
to 
ensure UnrelEv_flight
i 
'm 
getting UnrelEv_flight
the 
best 
possible 
deal 
. 
on 
the 
day 
of 
my

with 
plenty 
of 
time

having 
traveled RelNScrEv_flight
before 
, 
i 
know UnrelEv_flight
this 
can 
be UnrelEv_flight
quite 
time 
consuming 
, 
so 
i 
try 
to 
be UnrelEv_flight
there 
at 
least 
an 
hour 
and 
a 
half 
before 
boarding 
time 
. 
once 
i 
'm UnrelEv_flight
through 
security 
i 
head ScrEv_find_terminal
towards 
my 
gate 
. 
if 
i 
have UnrelEv_flight
time 
i 
may 
stop UnrelEv_flight
for 
a 
snack 
or 
some 
shopping RelNScrEv_flight
, 
though 
i 
make+sure UnrelEv_flight
to 
keep ScrEv_listen_call
an 
ear 
out 
for 
my 
flight 
to 
be 
called ScrEv_listen_call
for 
boarding ScrEv_board_plane
. 
once 
i 
am 
called ScrEv_listen_call
, 
i 
patiently 
and 
orderly 
wait ScrEv_wait_boarding
my 
turn 
to 
enter ScrEv_board_plane
the 
airplane 
. 
i 
place ScrEv_stow_away_luggage
my 
carry 
on 
in 
the 
assigned RelNScrEv_flight
bin 
, 
take ScrEv_take_seat
my 
seat 
, 
get RelNScrEv_flight
a 
book 
out 
and 
make UnrelEv_flight
myself 
as 
comfortable 
as 
possible 
. 
if 
i 
'm 
correctly 
prepared RelNScrEv_flight
, 
flying Evoking_flight
can 
be UnrelEv_flight
a 
wholly 
pleasant 
experience 
. 
<end_of_story>_flight 
i 
'm UnrelEv_flight
so 
excited 
for 
my 
trip 
to 
florida 
! 
it 
's 
going 
to 
be UnrelEv_flight
warm 
and 
i 
'm 
looking+forward UnrelEv_flight
to 
visiting 
disney 
world 
. 
the 
most 
exciting 
part 
will 
be UnrelEv_flight
the 
plane 
ride 
. 
when 
i 
arrive ScrEv_get_airport
at 
the 
airport 
, 
i 
get+into ScrEv_go_check_in
the 
check 
in 
line 
. 
i 
show ScrEv_present_ID/ticket
the 
woman 
at 
the 
counter 
my 
ticket 
. 
she 
asks RelNScrEv_flight
to 
see 
either 
my 
driver 
's 
license 
or 
a 
passport 
. 
i 
hand ScrEv_present_ID/ticket
her 
my 
passport 
. 
she 
asks RelNScrEv_flight
me 
how 
many 
suitcases 
i 
will 
be 
brining UnrelEv_flight
with 
me 
. 
i 
tell RelNScrEv_flight
her 
two 
. 
she 
prints+off RelNScrEv_flight
stickers 
to 
put+on UnrelEv_flight
my 
bags 
so 
that 
they 
know UnrelEv_flight
which 
plane 
to 
put UnrelEv_flight
my 
bags 
on 
. 
next 
, 
she 
prints+out RelNScrEv_flight
my 
boarding 
pass 
. 
i 
will 
need UnrelEv_flight
this 
to 
be 
able 
to 
get ScrEv_board_plane
onto 
the 
plane 
. 
she 
tells RelNScrEv_flight
me 
that 
my 
plane 
will 
be 
leaving ScrEv_take_off
from 
gate 
a7 
. 
i 
follow ScrEv_find_terminal
the 
signs 
that 
point UnrelEv_flight
towards 
gate 
a7 
. 
before 
i 
can 
enter ScrEv_find_terminal
the 
'' 
`` 
a 
'' 
'' 
terminal 
, 
i 
must 
go+through ScrEv_go_security_checks
a 
security 
check 
point 
. 
i 
take ScrEv_go_security_checks
a 
plastic 
bin 
and 
place ScrEv_go_security_checks
all 
my 
loose 
belongings 
in 
there 
- 
like 
my 
backpack 
, 
keys 
and 
cell 
phone 
. 
i 
also 
must 
remove ScrEv_go_security_checks
my 
shoes 
and 
place ScrEv_go_security_checks
them 
in 
a 
bin 
. 
the 
bins 
run UnrelEv_flight
along 
a 
conveyor 
belt 
and 
into 
an 
x-ray 
machine 
. 
people 
monitor UnrelEv_flight
the 
x-ray 
machine 
to 
make+sure UnrelEv_flight
there 
is 
nothing 
dangerous 
in 
my 
belongings 
. 
a 
man 
waves ScrEv_go_security_checks
at 
me 
to 
walk+through ScrEv_go_security_checks
a 
metal 
detector 
. 
it 
does 
n't 
hurt UnrelEv_flight
. 
it 
's 
just 
like 
walking UnrelEv_flight
through 
an 
open 
door 
. 
after 
i 
am 
cleared ScrEv_go_security_checks
at 
security 
, 
i 
collect ScrEv_go_security_checks
my 
bags 
and 
head+to ScrEv_find_terminal
the 
gate 
. 
thirty 
minutes 
later 
, 
my 
plane 
has 
arrived RelNScrEv_flight
and 
an 
airline 
employee 
announces ScrEv_listen_call
that 
we 
will 
be 
boarding ScrEv_board_plane
. 
the 
plane 
boards ScrEv_board_plane
according 
to 
what 
row 
you 
are 
seated UnrelEv_flight
in 
. 
luckily 
, 
i 
'm UnrelEv_flight
in 
row 
one 
so 
i 
get 
to 
go+on ScrEv_board_plane
the 
plane 
first 
! 
after 
everyone 
is 
seated ScrEv_take_seat
and 
their 
carry 
on 
bags 
are 
either 
placed ScrEv_stow_away_luggage
in 
the 
upper 
storage 
bins 
or 
under 
out 
seats 
, 
the 
flight 
attendant 
announces ScrEv_listen_crew
we 
are 
ready 
to 
take+off ScrEv_take_off
! 
i 
buckle ScrEv_buckle_seat_belt
my 
seatbelt 
and 
then 
the 
plane 
slowly 
taxis ScrEv_take_off_preparations
to 
the 
runway 
. 
the 
friendly 
flight 
attendant 
talks ScrEv_listen_crew
about 
safety 
procedures 
while 
we 
are 
driving ScrEv_take_off_preparations
to 
the 
runway 
. 
within 
two 
minutes 
, 
the 
plane 
starts 
moving ScrEv_take_off
faster 
and 
faster 
and 
before 
i 
know UnrelEv_flight
it 
, 
we 
are UnrelEv_flight
up 
in 
the 
air 
! 
two 
of 
the 
flight 
attendants 
come+over RelNScrEv_flight
and 
offer RelNScrEv_flight
me 
a 
drink 
and 
a 
snack 
. 
i 
choose RelNScrEv_flight
a 
diet 
coke 
and 
some 
pretzels 
. 
while 
flying ScrEv_other_flight
, 
i 
totally 
forget UnrelEv_flight
i 
'm 
up 
in 
the 
air 
. 
it 
's UnrelEv_flight
a 
bit 
noisy 
, 
as 
if 
riding UnrelEv_flight
in 
a 
train 
, 
but 
i 
forget UnrelEv_flight
we 
are UnrelEv_flight
n't 
on 
the 
ground 
523 
until 
i 
look ScrEv_spend_time_flight
outside 
and 
see 
the 
clouds 
passing+by UnrelEv_flight
. 
the 
pilot 
comes ScrEv_listen_crew
on 
the 
pa 
system 
a 
few 
times 
to 
announce ScrEv_listen_crew
things 
like 
cruising 
altitude 
and 
the 
current 
weather 
temperature 
in 
florida 
. 
about 
two 
and 
half 
hours 
after 
take+off ScrEv_take_off
, 
the 
pilot 
asks ScrEv_listen_crew
us 
to 
prepare UnrelEv_flight
for 
landing ScrEv_landing
. 
we 
have 
to 
put RelNScrEv_flight
our 
seats 
upright 
and 
make+sure RelNScrEv_flight
we 
are 
buckled+in ScrEv_buckle_seat_belt
. 
i 
can 
feel UnrelEv_flight
the 
plane 
slowly 
descending ScrEv_landing
. 
my 
ears 
feel UnrelEv_flight
a 
bit 
uncomfortable 
from 
the 
change 
in 
air 
pressure 
. 
i 
can 
see UnrelEv_flight
houses 
and 
trees 
getting UnrelEv_flight
closer 
. 
the 
plane 
bumps RelNScrEv_flight
once 
when 
the 
landing 
gear 
touches ScrEv_landing
the 
ground 
. 
we 
roll ScrEv_landing
smoothly 
to 
the 
end 
of 
the 
runway 
and 
then 
taxi RelNScrEv_flight
over 
to 
the 
gate 
. 
i 
gather+up RelNScrEv_flight
my 
belongings 
and 
thank RelNScrEv_flight
the 
flight 
crew 
for 
a 
wonderful 
flight 
. 
i 
ca 
n't 
wait UnrelEv_flight
to 
start UnrelEv_flight
my 
vacation 
! 
<end_of_story>_flight 
five 
years 
ago 
i 
went RelNScrEv_flight
to 
new 
york 
city 
. 
i 
live UnrelEv_flight
in 
missouri 
, 
so 
new 
york 
city 
is UnrelEv_flight
very 
far 
away 
from 
me 
. 
i 
decided UnrelEv_flight
to 
buy ScrEv_get_ticket
plain 
tickets 
so 
i 
could 
ride+in+an+airplane Evoking_flight
to 
get UnrelEv_flight
there 
. 
i 
had 
never 
ridden+on+an+airplane Evoking_flight
before 
, 
so 
i 
was UnrelEv_flight
a 
little 
bit 
nervous 
. 
i 
ordered ScrEv_get_ticket
my 
plane 
tickets 
online 
. 
my 
sister 
drove ScrEv_get_airport
me 
to 
the 
airport 
. 
once 
i 
got ScrEv_get_airport
there 
, 
i 
went ScrEv_go_check_in
up 
to 
the 
counter 
to 
check ScrEv_check_luggage
my 
luggage 
. 
the 
lady 
working UnrelEv_flight
at 
the 
counter 
was UnrelEv_flight
very 
nice 
and 
told RelNScrEv_flight
me 
where 
to 
go ScrEv_find_terminal
. 
i 
went ScrEv_go_security_checks
through 
a 
metal 
detector 
that 
security 
guards 
were 
monitoring UnrelEv_flight
. 
i 
found ScrEv_find_terminal
my 
airplane 
terminal 
, 
and 
i 
patiently 
waited ScrEv_wait_boarding
while 
sitting UnrelEv_flight
in 
a 
chair 
. 
over 
the 
speakers 
, 
a 
voice 
told ScrEv_listen_call
passengers 
we 
could 
begin UnrelEv_flight
boarding ScrEv_board_plane
the 
plane 
. 
i 
got+onto ScrEv_board_plane
the 
plane 
and 
the 
ride 
took UnrelEv_flight
about 
three 
hours 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_flight
a 
pretty 
simple 
experience 
. 
<end_of_story>_flight 
my 
wife 
and 
i 
were 
flying Evoking_flight
to 
new 
york 
city 
for 
a 
vacation 
. 
we 
both 
like UnrelEv_flight
to 
fly Evoking_flight
. 
after 
going+through Unclear_flight
the 
preliminaries 
and 
waiting ScrEv_wait_boarding
in 
the 
lounge 
, 
we 
were 
soon 
stepping+onto ScrEv_board_plane
the 
plane 
and 
trying 
to 
find RelNScrEv_flight
our 
seats 
. 
planes 
can 
be UnrelEv_flight
crowded 
when 
one 
is 
getting Unclear_flight
on 
or 
off 
, 
but 
we 
found RelNScrEv_flight
our 
seats 
and 
buckled ScrEv_buckle_seat_belt
in 
. 
it 
took UnrelEv_flight
a 
bit 
of 
time 
for 
everyone 
to 
settle+in ScrEv_take_seat
, 
but 
before 
long 
the 
plane 
was 
taxiing ScrEv_take_off_preparations
down 
the 
runway 
. 
when 
the 
plane 
lifted+off ScrEv_take_off
, 
i 
could 
feel UnrelEv_flight
it 
tilt RelNScrEv_flight
to 
one 
side 
and 
then 
right RelNScrEv_flight
itself 
again 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_flight
fun 
looking ScrEv_spend_time_flight
out 
of 
the 
window 
and 
seeing ScrEv_spend_time_flight
the 
world 
below 
get UnrelEv_flight
smaller 
and 
smaller 
, 
then 
disappear UnrelEv_flight
as 
we 
climbed ScrEv_other_flight
above 
the 
clouds 
. 
we 
both 
enjoyed UnrelEv_flight
the 
plane 
ride 
a 
great 
deal 
. 
a 
flight 
attendant 
offered RelNScrEv_flight
us 
drinks 
and 
snacks 
, 
and 
we 
had ScrEv_spend_time_flight
some 
orange 
soda 
and 
complimentary 
peanuts 
. 
soon 
the 
flight 
was UnrelEv_flight
over 
, 
and 
it 
was 
time 
to 
disembark ScrEv_exit_plane
. 
we 
had 
enjoyed UnrelEv_flight
the 
airplane 
ride 
. 
<end_of_story>_flight 
i 
flew+on+an+airplane Evoking_flight
about 
523 
months 
ago 
. 
i 
was 
going RelNScrEv_flight
from 
chicago 
to 
los 
angeles 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_flight
a 
very 
early 
flight 
. 
my 
brother 
was 
able 
to 
drop ScrEv_get_airport
me 
off 
at 
the 
airport 
. 
i 
had 
already 
checked+in ScrEv_check_in
online 
the 
night 
before 
and 
had UnrelEv_flight
no 
bags 
to 
check ScrEv_check_luggage
, 
so 
i 
walked RelNScrEv_flight
straight 
to 
the 
security 
line 
. 
once 
tsa 
checked ScrEv_present_ID/ticket
my 
id 
and 
boarding 
pass 
, 
i 
stood ScrEv_wait
in 
line 
for 
about 
523 
minutes 
while 
i 
waited ScrEv_wait
for 
my 
bags\/body 
to 
be 
scanned ScrEv_go_security_checks
. 
once 
through 
security 
, 
i 
checked RelNScrEv_flight
the 
monitors 
to 
see UnrelEv_flight
that 
my 
flight 
was UnrelEv_flight
on 
time 
and 
that 
there 
was UnrelEv_flight
not 
a 
last 
minute 
gate 
change 
. 
i 
then 
walked ScrEv_find_terminal
to 
the 
gate 
and 
boarded ScrEv_board_plane
the 
plane 
about 
523 
minutes 
later 
. 
the 
flight 
attendants 
went+over ScrEv_listen_crew
the 
safety 
procedures 
, 
the 
captain 
gave ScrEv_listen_crew
his 
greetings 
, 
and 
we 
were UnrelEv_flight
on 
our 
way 
. 
the 
flight 
was UnrelEv_flight
very 
smooth 
and 
quiet 
. 
the 
time 
flew+by UnrelEv_flight
, 
as 
i 
slept ScrEv_spend_time_flight
most 
of 
the 
way 
. 
we 
landed ScrEv_landing
on 
time 
. 
the 
plane 
then 
taxied RelNScrEv_flight
to 
the 
gate 
and 
everyone 
exited ScrEv_exit_plane
the 
plane 
. 
another 
successful 
flight 
. 
<end_of_story>_flight 
my 
friend 
and 
i 
were 
running UnrelEv_flight
late 
this 
morning 
. 
we 
needed 
to 
catch UnrelEv_flight
our 
plane 
, 
there 
was 
no 
time 
to 
shower UnrelEv_flight
we 
just 
had 
to 
grab RelNScrEv_flight
our 
luggage 
and 
run UnrelEv_flight
. 
since 
we 
were 
not 
flying Evoking_flight
out 
of 
the 
country 
we 
did 
n't 
need UnrelEv_flight
our 
passports 
, 
but 
we 
made+sure UnrelEv_flight
to 
grab ScrEv_get_ticket
our 
boarding 
passes 
before 
we 
left RelNScrEv_flight
the 
house 
. 
we 
called UnrelEv_flight
a 
cab 
and 
headed ScrEv_get_airport
to 
the 
airport 
. 
after 
we 
arrived ScrEv_get_airport
at 
the 
airport 
, 
we 
checked ScrEv_check_luggage
our 
bags 
and 
went ScrEv_go_security_checks
through 
security 
. 
after 
going ScrEv_go_security_checks
through 
security 
we 
headed ScrEv_find_terminal
to 
our 
gate 
and 
waited ScrEv_wait_boarding
to 
board ScrEv_board_plane
. 
when 
they 
finally 
said ScrEv_listen_call
they 
were 
boarding ScrEv_board_plane
our 
section 
we 
boarded ScrEv_board_plane
the 
aircraft 
and 
put ScrEv_stow_away_luggage
our 
checked ScrEv_go_security_checks
luggage 
in 
the 
overhead 
compartments 
and 
took ScrEv_take_seat
our 
seats 
. 
our 
part 
was 
done UnrelEv_flight
, 
we 
now 
just 
had 
to 
wait RelNScrEv_flight
for 
the 
plane 
to 
take+off ScrEv_take_off
. 
i 
was 
chewing UnrelEv_flight
gum 
so 
that 
my 
ears 
would 
not 
pop UnrelEv_flight
when 
we 
took+off ScrEv_take_off
. 
<end_of_story>_flight 
i 
needed UnrelEv_flight
a 
vacation 
so 
i 
went UnrelEv_flight
online 
and 
booked ScrEv_get_ticket
myself 
a 
ticket 
from 
my 
local 
airport 
to 
mexico 
. 
as 
the 
day 
arrived UnrelEv_flight
, 
i 
packed ScrEv_pack_luggage
everything 
i 
needed UnrelEv_flight
into 
a 
carry 
on 
bag 
and 
headed ScrEv_get_airport
to 
the 
airport 
. 
once 
there 
i 
got 
my 
ticket 
printed+out RelNScrEv_flight
and 
checked+in ScrEv_check_in
. 
i 
had 
to 
go+through ScrEv_go_security_checks
security 
and 
then 
wait ScrEv_wait_boarding
for 
about 
523 
minutes 
at 
the 
terminal 
. 
once 
they 
announced ScrEv_listen_call
boarding ScrEv_board_plane
, 
i 
got RelNScrEv_flight
in 
line 
and 
walked ScrEv_board_plane
onto 
the 
plane 
. 
i 
then 
stowed ScrEv_stow_away_luggage
my 
carry 
on 
bag 
above 
me 
and 
put ScrEv_stow_away_luggage
my 
backpack 
under 
the 
seat 
in 
front 
of 
me 
. 
i 
got+situated ScrEv_take_seat
with 
a 
book 
and 
put ScrEv_buckle_seat_belt
my 
seatbelt 
on 
. 
during 
the 
flight 
i 
put+in ScrEv_spend_time_flight
some 
ear 
buds 
and 
listened+to ScrEv_spend_time_flight
music 
while 
i 
read ScrEv_spend_time_flight
. 
i 
got RelNScrEv_flight
a 
water 
from 
the 
flight 
attendant 
and 
a 
small 
bag 
of 
peanuts 
. 
once 
the 
plane 
landed ScrEv_landing
, 
everyone 
got+up UnrelEv_flight
and 
waited ScrEv_wait
for 
a 
while 
as 
the 
people 
in 
front 
slowly 
filed+out ScrEv_exit_plane
. 
when 
it 
was UnrelEv_flight
finally 
my 
turn 
i 
grabbed RelNScrEv_flight
my 
carry 
on 
bag 
from 
above 
and 
exited ScrEv_exit_plane
the 
plane 
. 
<end_of_story>_flight 
today 
i 
am 
taking+an+airplane Evoking_flight
to 
go 
visit UnrelEv_flight
my 
grandmother 
. 
i 
bought ScrEv_get_ticket
the 
ticket 
a 
few 
weeks 
ago 
and 
last 
night 
i 
packed ScrEv_pack_luggage
my 
suitcases 
with 
clothes 
and 
the 
other 
items 
i 
would 
need UnrelEv_flight
for 
my 
trip 
. 
i 
woke+up UnrelEv_flight
early 
today 
and 
got RelNScrEv_flight
my 
id 
and 
my 
suitcase 
and 
headed ScrEv_get_airport
for 
the 
airport 
. 
after 
i 
parked UnrelEv_flight
my 
car 
, 
i 
went ScrEv_go_check_in
to 
the 
check 
in 
counter 
and 
showed ScrEv_present_ID/ticket
the 
worker 
my 
id 
. 
she 
printed+out RelNScrEv_flight
a 
ticket 
for 
me 
, 
checked+in ScrEv_check_luggage
my 
suitcase 
and 
told RelNScrEv_flight
me 
what 
gate 
to 
head ScrEv_find_terminal
to 
in 
order 
to 
catch UnrelEv_flight
my 
flight 
. 
as 
i 
got ScrEv_find_terminal
close 
to 
the 
gate 
i 
went+through ScrEv_go_security_checks
security 
where 
they 
scanned ScrEv_go_security_checks
my 
purse 
and 
carry-on 
bag 
then 
had 
me 
remove ScrEv_go_security_checks
my 
shoes 
and 
walk ScrEv_go_security_checks
through 
the 
metal 
detectors 
. 
i 
put RelNScrEv_flight
my 
shoes 
back 
on 
and 
got RelNScrEv_flight
my 
bags 
and 
then 
sat+down UnrelEv_flight
and 
waited ScrEv_wait_boarding
for 
my 
flight 
to 
start 
boarding ScrEv_board_plane
. 
when 
they 
made ScrEv_listen_call
an 
announcement 
that 
my 
plane 
was 
boarding ScrEv_board_plane
, 
i 
got RelNScrEv_flight
in 
line 
and 
waited ScrEv_wait
my 
turn 
. 
once 
i 
got ScrEv_board_plane
on 
the 
plane 
i 
looked+at RelNScrEv_flight
my 
ticket 
to 
find RelNScrEv_flight
my 
seat 
number 
, 
found RelNScrEv_flight
my 
seat 
and 
sat+down ScrEv_take_seat
and 
buckled ScrEv_buckle_seat_belt
my 
seat 
belt 
. 
after 
everyone 
was 
done 
boarding ScrEv_board_plane
, 
the 
pilot 
announced ScrEv_listen_crew
we 
were UnrelEv_flight
clear 
for 
take+off ScrEv_take_off
and 
the 
plane 
began UnrelEv_flight
to 
move ScrEv_take_off_preparations
. 
<end_of_story>_flight 
i 
needed 
to 
fly+out Evoking_flight
to 
visit UnrelEv_flight
my 
mom 
in 
another 
state 
, 
so 
i 
booked ScrEv_get_ticket
a 
flight 
on 
my 
favorite 
airline 
. 
when 
the 
day 
of 
the 
flight 
arrived UnrelEv_flight
, 
i 
already 
had 
my 
bags 
packed ScrEv_pack_luggage
, 
because 
i 
plan UnrelEv_flight
ahead 
and 
packed ScrEv_pack_luggage
them 
the 
previous 
night 
. 
then 
it 
was UnrelEv_flight
time 
to 
drive ScrEv_get_airport
to 
the 
airport 
. 
i 
parked UnrelEv_flight
my 
car 
at 
a 
nearby 
parking 
garage 
, 
and 
took ScrEv_get_airport
a 
special 
bus 
called UnrelEv_flight
a 
shuttle 
to 
the 
airport 
. 
i 
arrived ScrEv_get_airport
523 
hours 
early 
, 
because 
you 
want 
to 
make+sure UnrelEv_flight
to 
have 
plenty 
of 
time 
to 
get ScrEv_go_security_checks
through 
security 
. 
i 
went+to ScrEv_go_check_in
the 
check 
in 
booth 
and 
gave RelNScrEv_flight
them 
my 
information 
. 
i 
would 
have 
given ScrEv_check_luggage
them 
my 
larger 
luggage 
for 
them 
to 
put UnrelEv_flight
on 
the 
plane 
right 
there 
, 
but 
i 
was 
traveling RelNScrEv_flight
light 
so 
i 
only 
had UnrelEv_flight
'' 
`` 
carry 
on 
'' 
'' 
luggage 
, 
which 
i 
got 
to 
bring UnrelEv_flight
with 
me 
to 
my 
seat 
on 
the 
plane 
. 
then 
i 
went ScrEv_go_security_checks
through 
the 
air 
port 
security 
, 
where 
i 
had 
to 
take+off ScrEv_go_security_checks
my 
shoes 
and 
jacket 
and 
walk+through ScrEv_go_security_checks
a 
scanner 
. 
then 
i 
found ScrEv_find_terminal
the 
gate 
, 
the 
area 
of 
the 
airport 
where 
my 
plane 
would 
arrive RelNScrEv_flight
. 
i 
stayed ScrEv_wait_boarding
near 
the 
area 
, 
visiting UnrelEv_flight
a 
few 
gift 
shops 
, 
until 
the 
plane 
arrived RelNScrEv_flight
and 
we 
boarded ScrEv_board_plane
it 
. 
soon 
after 
, 
the 
plane 
went ScrEv_take_off_preparations
down 
the 
run 
way 
and 
took+off ScrEv_take_off
. 
the 
flight 
was UnrelEv_flight
n't 
a 
long 
one 
, 
so 
they 
did 
n't 
offer RelNScrEv_flight
us 
any 
food 
, 
but 
we 
did 
get RelNScrEv_flight
a 
choice 
of 
drinks 
, 
and 
i 
chose RelNScrEv_flight
a 
soda 
. 
then 
the 
plane 
landed ScrEv_landing
at 
the 
other 
airport 
, 
and 
we 
all 
got+off ScrEv_exit_plane
the 
plane 
. 
leaving ScrEv_leave_airport
the 
airport 
is 
much 
easier 
than 
entering ScrEv_get_airport
it 
, 
and 
i 
was UnrelEv_flight
soon 
out 
of 
the 
building 
and 
met ScrEv_meet_people
my 
mother 
in 
her 
car 
outside 
. 
<end_of_story>_flight 
last 
summer 
i 
decided UnrelEv_flight
it 
would 
be UnrelEv_flight
a 
fantastic 
idea 
to 
visit RelNScrEv_flight
my 
friend 
on 
the 
other 
side 
of 
the 
country 
. 
normally 
i 
might 
drive UnrelEv_flight
, 
as 
i 
do 
n't 
mind+driving UnrelEv_flight
, 
but 
i 
was UnrelEv_flight
on 
a 
tight 
schedule 
with 
work 
and 
needed 
to 
keep UnrelEv_flight
the 
trip 
short 
. 
i 
decided UnrelEv_flight
i 
needed 
to 
fly Evoking_flight
. 
i 
visited RelNScrEv_flight
an 
airline 
price 
comparing 
website 
, 
and 
ultimately 
chose UnrelEv_flight
to 
book ScrEv_get_ticket
a 
flight 
from 
charlotte 
where 
i 
lived UnrelEv_flight
to 
san 
francisco 
where 
my 
friend 
lived UnrelEv_flight
. 
the 
airline 
was UnrelEv_flight
a 
well 
known 
carrier 
, 
american 
, 
and 
the 
round 
trip 
fare 
was UnrelEv_flight
phenomenal 
at 
only 
$ 
523 
. 
what 
a 
deal 
! 
after 
i 
booked ScrEv_get_ticket
the 
flight 
, 
i 
was 
emailed RelNScrEv_flight
a 
boarding 
pass 
to 
print+out RelNScrEv_flight
. 
the 
day 
of 
the 
flight 
i 
brought RelNScrEv_flight
my 
luggage 
and 
boarding 
pass 
with 
me 
to 
the 
airport 
. 
inside 
the 
airport 
, 
i 
visited ScrEv_go_check_in
the 
ticket 
counter 
to 
present ScrEv_present_ID/ticket
my 
boarding 
pass 
and 
luggage 
. 
my 
luggage 
was 
checked-in ScrEv_check_luggage
for 
a 
small 
fee 
, 
leaving UnrelEv_flight
me 
free 
to 
board ScrEv_board_plane
the 
plane 
without 
having 
to 
carry UnrelEv_flight
the 
burden 
of 
all 
that 
weight 
. 
i 
had 
to 
wait ScrEv_wait
through 
a 
security 
line 
and 
get 
checked ScrEv_go_security_checks
for 
illegal 
items 
before 
proceeding RelNScrEv_flight
to 
the 
gate 
. 
this 
process 
took UnrelEv_flight
about 
523 
minutes 
. 
once 
at 
the 
gate 
i 
showed ScrEv_present_boarding_pass
my 
boarding 
pass 
again 
and 
walked ScrEv_board_plane
onto 
the 
plane 
. 
i 
was 
directed RelNScrEv_flight
towards 
my 
assigned UnrelEv_flight
seat 
in 
the 
economy 
class 
cabin 
. 
after 
a 
few 
more 
minutes 
the 
plane 
pushed+back ScrEv_take_off_preparations
and 
began 
taxiing ScrEv_take_off_preparations
to 
the 
runway 
. 
during 
this 
time 
other 
passengers 
and 
myself 
were 
instructed ScrEv_listen_crew
to 
buckle ScrEv_buckle_seat_belt
our 
seat 
belts 
and 
watch ScrEv_listen_crew
a 
safety 
demonstration 
on 
what 
to 
do UnrelEv_flight
in 
the 
event 
of 
an 
in-flight 
emergency 
. 
we 
then 
took+off ScrEv_take_off
, 
climbed ScrEv_other_flight
to 
about 
34,000 
feet 
, 
and 
roamed ScrEv_other_flight
the 
skies 
westward 
. 
i 
slept ScrEv_spend_time_flight
for 
the 
remainder 
of 
the 
flight 
. 
upon 
waking+up RelNScrEv_flight
the 
plane 
was 
just 
touching+down ScrEv_landing
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_flight
a 
very 
quick 
flight 
, 
only 
523 
hours 
. 
i 
stepped ScrEv_exit_plane
off 
the 
plane 
and 
walked UnrelEv_flight
to 
baggage 
pickup 
. 
when 
my 
bags 
came RelNScrEv_flight
around 
the 
belt 
, 
i 
picked RelNScrEv_flight
them 
up 
and 
walked ScrEv_leave_airport
outside 
, 
where 
my 
friend 
was 
waiting RelNScrEv_flight
for 
me 
. 
all 
in 
all 
it 
was UnrelEv_flight
a 
fun 
and 
painless 
journey 
. 
i 
would 
definitely 
do UnrelEv_flight
it 
again 
. 
<end_of_story>_flight 
my 
wife 
decided UnrelEv_flight
she 
wanted 
to 
go UnrelEv_flight
to 
the 
beach 
last 
summer 
. 
we 
decided UnrelEv_flight
the 
best 
way 
to 
get UnrelEv_flight
there 
would 
be UnrelEv_flight
an 
airplane 
. 
we 
booked ScrEv_get_ticket
the 
tickets 
523 
months 
in 
advance 
to 
ensure UnrelEv_flight
we 
would 
have UnrelEv_flight
tickets 
to 
board ScrEv_board_plane
the 
plane 
to 
take UnrelEv_flight
us 
to 
our 
vacation 
destination 
. 
when 
the 
day 
finally 
came UnrelEv_flight
fly+on+the+airplane Evoking_flight
, 
we 
made+sure UnrelEv_flight
we 
arrived ScrEv_get_airport
at 
least 
an 
hour 
and 
a 
half 
early 
. 
there 
are UnrelEv_flight
many 
delays 
before 
you 
actually 
get+on+board ScrEv_board_plane
an 
airplane 
. 
first 
, 
, 
you 
have 
to 
go+through ScrEv_go_security_checks
a 
metal 
detector 
and 
wait ScrEv_wait
in 
long 
lines 
just 
to 
get ScrEv_go_security_checks
to 
the 
metal 
detectors 
. 
then 
you 
have 
to 
check ScrEv_check_luggage
your 
luggage 
. 
after 
that 
, 
you 
have 
to 
go ScrEv_find_terminal
to 
the 
terminal 
and 
provide ScrEv_present_boarding_pass
proof 
of 
a 
ticket 
. 
once 
you 
get+on ScrEv_board_plane
an 
airplane 
, 
you 
have 
to 
prepare UnrelEv_flight
for 
turbulence 
. 
other 
than 
that 
, 
flying+on+an+airplane Evoking_flight
is UnrelEv_flight
a 
safe 
and 
efficient 
way 
to 
travel RelNScrEv_flight
. 
when 
we 
landed ScrEv_landing
, 
we 
went ScrEv_go_target_location
straight 
to 
the 
beach 
. 
<end_of_story>_flight 
last 
week 
, 
i 
decided UnrelEv_flight
to 
travel RelNScrEv_flight
to 
see UnrelEv_flight
my 
brother 
. 
i 
went ScrEv_get_airport
to 
the 
airport 
with 
my 
luggage 
and 
checked+in ScrEv_go_check_in
with 
the 
airline 
, 
where 
i 
received ScrEv_get_ticket
my 
ticket 
from 
the 
clerk 
. 
my 
luggage 
was 
weighed ScrEv_check_luggage
and 
tagged ScrEv_check_luggage
and 
i 
gave ScrEv_check_luggage
it 
to 
the 
clerk 
. 
i 
proceeded UnrelEv_flight
upstairs 
with 
my 
ticket 
and 
waited ScrEv_wait
in 
line 
to 
go+through ScrEv_go_security_checks
airport 
security 
. 
once 
i 
went+through ScrEv_go_security_checks
the 
security 
checkpoint 
, 
i 
located ScrEv_find_terminal
the 
concourse 
area 
and 
gate 
where 
my 
flight 
was 
to 
depart ScrEv_take_off
from 
. 
i 
sat UnrelEv_flight
and 
waited ScrEv_wait_boarding
until 
my 
flight 
was 
boarding ScrEv_board_plane
. 
i 
then 
got+up UnrelEv_flight
and 
waited ScrEv_wait
in 
line 
to 
get+on ScrEv_board_plane
the 
airplane 
. 
while 
i 
was 
waiting ScrEv_wait
in 
line 
, 
i 
checked RelNScrEv_flight
my 
seat 
number 
. 
once 
i 
was UnrelEv_flight
on 
the 
plane 
, 
i 
located RelNScrEv_flight
my 
seat 
and 
sat+down ScrEv_take_seat
. 
i 
then 
buckled ScrEv_buckle_seat_belt
my 
seat 
belt 
and 
took+out UnrelEv_flight
a 
book 
to 
read ScrEv_spend_time_flight
during 
the 
flight 
. 
as 
the 
plane 
prepared ScrEv_take_off_preparations
to 
take+off ScrEv_take_off
, 
the 
flight 
attendant 
went+over ScrEv_listen_crew
all 
of 
the 
emergency 
procedures 
. 
once 
the 
plane 
was 
flying ScrEv_other_flight
in 
the 
air 
, 
the 
flight 
attendant 
asked RelNScrEv_flight
me 
if 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_flight
a 
beverage 
. 
i 
choose RelNScrEv_flight
to 
have ScrEv_spend_time_flight
a 
cup 
of 
orange 
juice 
and 
was 
also 
given RelNScrEv_flight
a 
bag 
of 
pretzels 
as 
a 
snack 
. 
i 
continued UnrelEv_flight
to 
read ScrEv_spend_time_flight
my 
book 
with 
my 
seat 
belt 
on 
until 
the 
captain 
of 
the 
flight 
came ScrEv_listen_crew
over 
the 
loud 
speaker 
and 
said ScrEv_listen_crew
that 
we 
were 
approaching ScrEv_other_flight
our 
destination 
. 
the 
plane 
landed ScrEv_landing
and 
i 
put UnrelEv_flight
my 
book 
away 
. 
when 
i 
got+off ScrEv_exit_plane
of 
the 
plane 
, 
my 
brother 
was 
waiting UnrelEv_flight
for 
me 
at 
the 
gate 
. 
we 
had UnrelEv_flight
a 
very 
nice 
trip 
together 
. 
<end_of_story>_flight 
i 
love UnrelEv_flight
to 
travel RelNScrEv_flight
the 
usa 
, 
and 
recently 
, 
the 
world 
. 
without 
the 
advent 
of 
the 
modern 
airplane 
this 
would 
be UnrelEv_flight
both 
very 
time 
consuming 
and 
very 
expensive 
. 
to 
save UnrelEv_flight
money 
, 
i 
like 
to 
research RelNScrEv_flight
fares 
by 
time 
and 
location 
. 
we 
live UnrelEv_flight
in 
a 
small 
city 
so 
many 
times 
we 
can 
drive ScrEv_get_airport
a 
few 
hours 
and 
save UnrelEv_flight
a 
lot 
of 
money 
by 
flying Evoking_flight
out 
of 
that 
airport 
. 
when 
i 
get+to ScrEv_get_airport
the 
airport 
, 
i 
check ScrEv_check_luggage
my 
bags 
and 
go+through ScrEv_go_security_checks
security 
. 
after 
passing ScrEv_go_security_checks
through 
security 
, 
i 
like 
to 
check UnrelEv_flight
my 
email 
, 
talk UnrelEv_flight
to 
family 
and 
friends 
, 
and 
do 
some 
reading UnrelEv_flight
over 
a 
cup 
of 
coffee 
. 
then 
we 
shut+down RelNScrEv_flight
the 
phone 
and 
get+on ScrEv_get_plane
the 
plane 
. 
i 
love UnrelEv_flight
the 
window 
seat 
and 
enjoy 
watching ScrEv_spend_time_flight
the 
clouds 
and 
the 
ground 
below 
us 
as 
we 
are 
flying ScrEv_other_flight
to 
the 
destination 
. 
upon 
landing ScrEv_landing
i 
head ScrEv_go_target_location
out 
to 
the 
next 
destination 
. 
<end_of_story>_flight 
with 
a 
yawn 
i 
realized UnrelEv_flight
why 
i 
was UnrelEv_flight
so 
tired 
. 
i 
had 
flown Evoking_flight
home 
yesterday 
. 
and 
it 
was UnrelEv_flight
a 
very 
long 
flight 
. 
i 
had 
purchased ScrEv_get_ticket
my 
ticket 
online 
, 
so 
i 
only 
had 
to 
check-in ScrEv_check_in
when 
i 
arrived ScrEv_get_airport
at 
the 
airport 
. 
the 
took ScrEv_check_luggage
my 
bag 
at 
that 
time 
, 
and 
i 
walked+over RelNScrEv_flight
to 
the 
security 
gate 
. 
i 
was UnrelEv_flight
really 
happy 
i 
had 
remembered UnrelEv_flight
to 
wear 
slip 
on 
, 
sensible 
shoes 
, 
and 
easy 
fit 
clothing 
. 
i 
placed ScrEv_go_security_checks
my 
purse 
and 
shoes 
in 
the 
bucket 
to 
go+through ScrEv_go_security_checks
the 
scanner 
, 
and 
stepped+through ScrEv_go_security_checks
a 
scanner 
of 
my 
own 
. 
sometimes 
that 
is 
all 
it 
takes UnrelEv_flight
, 
but 
i 
was 
tapped UnrelEv_flight
on 
the 
shoulder 
, 
and 
pulled+aside ScrEv_go_security_checks
for 
a 
random 
search 
. 
this 
didnt 
upset UnrelEv_flight
me 
though 
, 
it 
happens UnrelEv_flight
, 
although 
with 
more 
frequency 
than 
i 
would 
like UnrelEv_flight
. 
a 
few 
moments 
of 
pat+down ScrEv_go_security_checks
, 
and 
i 
was 
putting RelNScrEv_flight
my 
shoes 
back 
on 
. 
taking RelNScrEv_flight
my 
purse 
i 
headed ScrEv_find_terminal
for 
the 
gate 
listed UnrelEv_flight
on 
my 
boarding 
pass 
. 
near 
the 
gate 
was UnrelEv_flight
a 
small 
shop 
. 
i 
decided UnrelEv_flight
to 
buy UnrelEv_flight
a 
bottle 
of 
water 
, 
and 
a 
magazine 
to 
read ScrEv_spend_time_flight
on 
the 
plane 
. 
i 
heard ScrEv_listen_call
an 
announcement 
that 
my 
plane 
was 
beginning 
to 
board ScrEv_board_plane
, 
so 
i 
paid UnrelEv_flight
quickly 
, 
and 
joined UnrelEv_flight
the 
line 
at 
the 
gate 
. 
they 
checked ScrEv_present_boarding_pass
my 
boarding 
pass 
as 
i 
reached UnrelEv_flight
the 
head 
of 
the 
line 
, 
and 
now 
i 
was 
headed ScrEv_get_plane
down 
a 
small 
hallway 
to 
the 
plane 
. 
i 
could 
hear UnrelEv_flight
the 
whine 
of 
engines 
as 
i 
went+through ScrEv_board_plane
the 
entry 
door 
. 
the 
airline 
personnel 
smiled UnrelEv_flight
and 
greeted RelNScrEv_flight
me 
, 
checked ScrEv_present_boarding_pass
my 
boarding 
pass 
, 
and 
gave UnrelEv_flight
me 
a 
general 
idea 
of 
where 
to 
find RelNScrEv_flight
my 
seat 
. 
it 
wasnt 
long 
before 
they 
closed UnrelEv_flight
the 
door 
, 
and 
they 
were 
giving ScrEv_listen_crew
safety 
instructions 
. 
i 
listened ScrEv_listen_crew
closely 
, 
reading RelNScrEv_flight
along 
on 
the 
safety 
card 
, 
and 
smiled+remembering UnrelEv_flight
my 
first 
airline 
flight 
. 
i 
had 
been UnrelEv_flight
523 
, 
and 
could 
not 
read UnrelEv_flight
yet 
. 
i 
leaned UnrelEv_flight
my 
head 
back 
, 
as 
the 
plane 
taxi ScrEv_take_off_preparations
'd 
, 
then 
sped ScrEv_take_off
down 
the 
runway 
for 
takeoff ScrEv_take_off
. 
<end_of_story>_flight 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_flight
to 
visit RelNScrEv_flight
my 
family 
that 
lived UnrelEv_flight
far 
away 
for 
christmas 
. 
i 
knew UnrelEv_flight
that 
it 
was UnrelEv_flight
too 
far 
for 
me 
to 
drive UnrelEv_flight
, 
so 
i 
decided UnrelEv_flight
to 
fly Evoking_flight
. 
i 
went UnrelEv_flight
online 
and 
searched RelNScrEv_flight
for 
tickets 
. 
i 
found ScrEv_get_ticket
a 
ticket 
that 
was UnrelEv_flight
the 
cheapest 
with 
the 
fewest 
layovers 
, 
because 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_flight
to 
spend UnrelEv_flight
as 
little 
time 
as 
possible 
traveling RelNScrEv_flight
on 
my 
trip 
to 
my 
family 
's 
house 
. 
i 
brought UnrelEv_flight
my 
ticket 
to 
the 
airport 
on 
the 
day 
that 
i 
was 
to 
depart ScrEv_take_off
. 
i 
went ScrEv_find_terminal
to 
the 
gate 
of 
the 
airline 
that 
i 
was 
flying ScrEv_other_flight
and 
handed+in ScrEv_present_ID/ticket
my 
ticket 
. 
i 
waited ScrEv_wait_boarding
in 
the 
airport 
until 
the 
plane 
was UnrelEv_flight
ready 
to 
be 
boarded ScrEv_board_plane
. 
i 
got UnrelEv_flight
in 
line 
and 
boarded ScrEv_board_plane
the 
plane 
. 
i 
found RelNScrEv_flight
a 
seat 
and 
buckled ScrEv_buckle_seat_belt
my 
seat 
belt 
. 
it 
took UnrelEv_flight
a 
couple 
hours 
of 
flying ScrEv_other_flight
until 
we 
landed ScrEv_landing
. 
i 
got+off ScrEv_exit_plane
of 
the 
plane 
and 
met ScrEv_meet_people
up 
with 
my 
family 
in 
the 
airport 
. 
<end_of_story>_flight 
last 
year 
i 
had UnrelEv_flight
extra 
vacation 
days 
which 
if 
not 
used UnrelEv_flight
would 
not 
have 
carried+over UnrelEv_flight
to 
this 
year 
. 
so 
in 
early 
novermber 
, 
i 
started+planning UnrelEv_flight
for 
a 
vacation 
and 
decided UnrelEv_flight
to 
go UnrelEv_flight
to 
new 
york 
. 
i 
purchased ScrEv_get_ticket
airline 
tickets 
for 
my 
family 
from 
a 
airline 
's 
website 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_flight
for 
523 
weeks 
starting UnrelEv_flight
from 
december 
7th 
to 
22nd 
. 
on 
7th 
evening 
, 
we 
reached ScrEv_get_airport
at 
the 
airport 
almost 
523 
hours 
before 
the 
flight 
's 
departure 
. 
at 
the 
check 
in 
counter 
, 
i 
presented ScrEv_present_ID/ticket
my 
driving 
license 
and 
ticket 
. 
the 
person 
at 
the 
counter 
verified ScrEv_check_in
my 
name 
and 
ticket 
and 
after 
security 
check 
, 
we 
got+into ScrEv_board_plane
the 
plane 
. 
i 
was UnrelEv_flight
at 
the 
window 
seat 
, 
so 
i 
could 
see UnrelEv_flight
the 
outside 
pretty 
well 
. 
before 
take+off ScrEv_take_off
, 
flight 
attendants 
asked ScrEv_listen_crew
us 
to 
put+on ScrEv_buckle_seat_belt
seat 
belts 
. 
it 
took UnrelEv_flight
almost 
523 
hours 
for 
us 
to 
reach ScrEv_other_flight
new 
york 
. 
overall 
it 
was UnrelEv_flight
a 
nice 
flight 
and 
we 
reached ScrEv_other_flight
there 
on 
time 
. 
<end_of_story>_flight 
a 
year 
ago 
i 
had 
to 
go 
visit RelNScrEv_flight
my 
relatives 
who 
lives UnrelEv_flight
in 
england 
. 
of 
course 
this 
meant UnrelEv_flight
the 
only 
viable 
method 
of 
travel 
would 
be 
to 
fly+on+an+airplane Evoking_flight
. 
i 
've 
never 
flown+on+an+airplane Evoking_flight
before 
so 
i 
was UnrelEv_flight
n't 
sure 
what 
the 
process 
involved UnrelEv_flight
. 
i 
decided UnrelEv_flight
to 
go UnrelEv_flight
online 
and 
do RelNScrEv_flight
some 
research 
about 
what 
i 
would 
need 
to 
do UnrelEv_flight
. 
i 
found+out UnrelEv_flight
it 
was UnrelEv_flight
actually 
a 
lot 
easier 
than 
i 
anticipated UnrelEv_flight
. 
i 
was 
able 
to 
buy ScrEv_get_ticket
my 
ticket 
online 
, 
and 
when 
the 
day 
of 
the 
flight 
came UnrelEv_flight
i 
had 
my 
friend 
drop ScrEv_get_airport
me 
off 
at 
the 
airport 
. 
i 
got UnrelEv_flight
in 
the 
security 
line 
which 
was UnrelEv_flight
very 
annoying 
and 
took UnrelEv_flight
a 
long 
time 
to 
get+through ScrEv_wait
. 
finally 
i 
got ScrEv_find_terminal
to 
the 
terminal 
and 
was 
able 
to 
board ScrEv_board_plane
the 
plane 
. 
i 
got+on ScrEv_board_plane
and 
stowed ScrEv_stow_away_luggage
my 
luggage 
and 
took ScrEv_take_seat
my 
seat 
. 
when 
the 
plane 
took+off ScrEv_take_off
i 
tried UnrelEv_flight
to 
fall+asleep ScrEv_spend_time_flight
to 
pass ScrEv_spend_time_flight
the 
time 
, 
but 
i 
was UnrelEv_flight
too 
excited 
. 
luckily 
i 
had UnrelEv_flight
a 
safe 
flight 
and 
was 
able 
to 
arrive ScrEv_other_flight
in 
england 
with 
no 
problems 
. 
<end_of_story>_flight 
i 
parked UnrelEv_flight
my 
car 
at 
the 
airport 
parking 
lot 
. 
i 
boarded RelNScrEv_flight
a 
shuttle 
bus 
that 
took ScrEv_get_airport
me 
to 
the 
airline 
departures 
. 
i 
headed ScrEv_get_airport
in 
the 
airport 
with 
my 
suitcase 
. 
found UnrelEv_flight
the 
proper 
line 
for 
my 
airline 
, 
and 
stood ScrEv_wait
in 
line 
waiting ScrEv_wait
with 
a 
lot 
of 
other 
passengers 
. 
when 
i 
got ScrEv_go_check_in
up 
to 
the 
desk 
, 
i 
checked ScrEv_check_luggage
my 
luggage 
in 
and 
was 
given ScrEv_other_flight
a 
boarding 
pass 
for 
my 
flight 
. 
i 
then 
walked+over RelNScrEv_flight
to 
the 
security 
line 
to 
get+into ScrEv_find_terminal
the 
airport 
terminal 
. 
i 
waited ScrEv_wait
in 
line 
for 
a 
long 
time 
. 
i 
showed ScrEv_present_ID/ticket
a 
tsa 
agent 
my 
driver 
's 
license 
and 
boarding 
pass 
. 
i 
then 
had 
to 
take+off ScrEv_go_security_checks
my 
shoes 
and 
put ScrEv_go_security_checks
all 
my 
belongings 
on 
a 
belt 
to 
be 
x-rayed ScrEv_go_security_checks
. 
then 
i 
walked ScrEv_go_security_checks
through 
a 
metal 
detector 
and 
the 
tsa 
agent 
motioned UnrelEv_flight
for 
me 
to 
move+on UnrelEv_flight
. 
i 
gathered+up UnrelEv_flight
my 
belongings 
, 
put UnrelEv_flight
my 
shoes 
back 
on 
and 
found ScrEv_find_terminal
my 
gate 
. 
i 
waited ScrEv_wait_boarding
with 
the 
other 
passengers 
until 
it 
was UnrelEv_flight
time 
to 
board ScrEv_board_plane
the 
airplane 
. 
we 
then 
walked ScrEv_get_plane
in 
a 
line 
through 
the 
doors 
, 
down 
a 
long 
hallway 
, 
and 
into 
the 
airplane 
. 
on 
the 
airplane 
i 
found RelNScrEv_flight
my 
seat 
. 
the 
airplane 
taxied ScrEv_take_off_preparations
down 
the 
runway 
and 
took+off ScrEv_take_off
. 
after 
a 
long 
while 
, 
the 
flight 
attendant 
passed+out RelNScrEv_flight
beverages 
and 
snacks 
to 
everyone 
. 
i 
drank ScrEv_spend_time_flight
my 
beverage 
, 
ate ScrEv_spend_time_flight
my 
snack 
and 
fell+asleep ScrEv_spend_time_flight
. 
when 
i 
woke+up ScrEv_spend_time_flight
we 
were 
landing ScrEv_landing
. 
we 
had 
to 
taxi RelNScrEv_flight
down 
the 
runway 
and 
wait RelNScrEv_flight
until 
a 
gate 
was UnrelEv_flight
available 
. 
once 
the 
airplane 
had 
stopped RelNScrEv_flight
, 
the 
signal 
came+on RelNScrEv_flight
that 
we 
could 
take RelNScrEv_flight
our 
seat 
belts 
off 
and 
get+up RelNScrEv_flight
. 
the 
doors 
open RelNScrEv_flight
and 
we 
all 
exited ScrEv_exit_plane
off 
the 
plane 
. 
<end_of_story>_flight 
flying+in+an+airplane Evoking_flight
is 
necessary 
to 
travel RelNScrEv_flight
to 
far 
away 
destinations 
that 
are UnrelEv_flight
not 
easily 
accessible 
by 
other 
modes 
of 
transportation 
. 
last 
summer 
, 
i 
had UnrelEv_flight
a 
girls 
trip 
to 
the 
carribean 
. 
we 
had 
to 
plan RelNScrEv_flight
our 
trip 
including 
booking ScrEv_get_ticket
airplane 
tickets 
and 
booking RelNScrEv_flight
hotels 
. 
we 
booked ScrEv_get_ticket
our 
airplane 
tickets 
online 
a 
few 
months 
before 
to 
get UnrelEv_flight
the 
best 
fare 
. 
we 
arrive ScrEv_get_airport
at 
the 
airport 
a 
few 
hours 
beforehand 
for 
an 
international 
flight 
. 
we 
all 
pack ScrEv_pack_luggage
lightly 
with 
one 
piece 
of 
luggage 
. 
after 
waiting ScrEv_wait_boarding
at 
the 
airport 
for 
a 
while 
, 
we 
boarded ScrEv_board_plane
our 
plane 
. 
the 
flight 
attendants 
and 
crew 
are UnrelEv_flight
friendly 
. 
we 
find RelNScrEv_flight
out 
seats 
and 
try 
to 
as 
comfortable 
in 
the 
cramped 
seating 
of 
a 
packed 
flight 
full 
of 
passengers 
. 
we 
try 
to 
relax UnrelEv_flight
, 
buckle+up ScrEv_buckle_seat_belt
for 
a 
four 
hour 
flight 
. 
during 
the 
four 
hour 
flight 
, 
we 
can 
sleep ScrEv_spend_time_flight
on 
watch ScrEv_spend_time_flight
tv 
or 
listen ScrEv_spend_time_flight
to 
music 
. 
and 
the 
crew 
will 
come+around UnrelEv_flight
with 
drinks 
and 
snacks 
. 
after 
a 
necessary 
flight 
, 
we 
arrive ScrEv_other_flight
at 
our 
destination 
safely

<end_of_story>_flight 
a 
few 
weeks 
ago 
, 
i 
flew+in+an+airplane Evoking_flight
to 
visit RelNScrEv_flight
my 
brother 
in 
tampa 
, 
florida 
, 
which 
is UnrelEv_flight
a 
thousand 
miles 
from 
me 
. 
i 
had 
bought ScrEv_get_ticket
my 
ticket 
six 
weeks 
earlier 
on 
the 
internet 
, 
and 
had 
packed RelNScrEv_flight
my 
bags 
the 
night 
before 
. 
the 
weather 
in 
tampa 
is UnrelEv_flight
very 
warm 
, 
so 
i 
packed ScrEv_pack_luggage
all 
summer 
clothes 
even 
though 
it 
was UnrelEv_flight
still 
winter 
. 
on 
the 
day 
of 
my 
flight 
, 
i 
arrived ScrEv_get_airport
early 
so 
that 
i 
would 
have UnrelEv_flight
time 
to 
go ScrEv_go_security_checks
through 
the 
security 
line 
, 
where 
they 
made 
me 
take+off ScrEv_go_security_checks
my 
shoes 
and 
my 
belt 
, 
and 
put ScrEv_go_security_checks
my 
bag 
through 
the 
x-ray 
machine 
. 
an 
airline 
worker 
made ScrEv_listen_call
an 
announcement 
when 
it 
was UnrelEv_flight
time 
for 
us 
to 
board ScrEv_board_plane
the 
flight 
. 
we 
went RelNScrEv_flight
to 
our 
assigned UnrelEv_flight
seats 
, 
put ScrEv_stow_away_luggage
our 
bags 
in 
the 
overhead 
compartments 
, 
and 
then 
buckled ScrEv_buckle_seat_belt
in 
. 
during 
the 
flight 
, 
i 
watched ScrEv_spend_time_flight
a 
movie 
on 
my 
kindle 
and 
got RelNScrEv_flight
a 
coke 
zero 
from 
the 
flight 
attended 
. 
when 
the 
flight 
landed ScrEv_landing
, 
my 
brother 
was 
waiting RelNScrEv_flight
for 
me 
outside 
the 
airport 
. 
<end_of_story>_flight 
last 
month 
i 
rode+on+an+airplane Evoking_flight
to 
visit RelNScrEv_flight
my 
family 
in 
california 
. 
i 
had 
purchased ScrEv_get_ticket
the 
tickets 
online 
the 
month 
before 
, 
so 
everything 
was UnrelEv_flight
ready 
to 
go UnrelEv_flight
. 
i 
packed ScrEv_pack_luggage
all 
the 
clothes 
, 
toiletries 
, 
books 
, 
and 
other 
things 
i 
would 
need UnrelEv_flight
for 
the 
trip 
the 
night 
before 
, 
then 
i 
went UnrelEv_flight
to 
bed 
early 
to 
make+sure UnrelEv_flight
i 
would 
be 
rested+up UnrelEv_flight
for 
the 
trip 
. 
i 
woke+up UnrelEv_flight
the 
next 
morning 
and 
took RelNScrEv_flight
a 
taxi 
cab 
to 
the 
airport 
. 
the 
cab 
driver 
dropped ScrEv_get_airport
me 
off 
at 
the 
front 
of 
the 
airport 
, 
and 
told UnrelEv_flight
me 
which 
way 
to 
go UnrelEv_flight
to 
make UnrelEv_flight
my 
plane 
. 
i 
headed RelNScrEv_flight
in 
the 
direction 
of 
american 
airlines 
, 
and 
got RelNScrEv_flight
in 
line 
at 
the 
check 
in 
stand 
. 
when 
my 
turn 
came UnrelEv_flight
i 
showed ScrEv_present_boarding_pass
the 
lady 
my 
boarding 
pass 
, 
and 
she 
explained RelNScrEv_flight
all 
the 
rules 
of 
flying Evoking_flight
to 
me 
. 
she 
then 
directed RelNScrEv_flight
me 
to 
another 
part 
of 
the 
airport 
where 
i 
would 
board ScrEv_board_plane
the 
plane 
at 
. 
before 
i 
could 
get ScrEv_board_plane
on 
the 
plane 
they 
made 
me 
go+through ScrEv_go_security_checks
a 
metal 
detector 
and 
checked ScrEv_go_security_checks
me 
bags 
. 
i 
got ScrEv_board_plane
on 
the 
plane 
and 
found RelNScrEv_flight
my 
seat 
. 
a 
lady 
showed RelNScrEv_flight
everyone 
on 
the 
plane 
what 
to 
do UnrelEv_flight
in 
case 
something 
went UnrelEv_flight
wrong 
, 
then 
the 
plane 
took+off ScrEv_take_off
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_flight
just 
a 
short 
flight 
, 
so 
there 
was 
no 
food 
served RelNScrEv_flight
, 
but 
we 
did 
get RelNScrEv_flight
drinks 
. 
before 
long 
they 
made ScrEv_listen_crew
an 
announcement 
that 
we 
were 
about 
to 
land ScrEv_landing
, 
and 
sure 
enough 
, 
they 
told ScrEv_listen_crew
us 
to 
buckle ScrEv_buckle_seat_belt
our 
seat 
belts 
. 
after 
the 
plane 
landed ScrEv_landing
we 
all 
got+off ScrEv_exit_plane
, 
and 
i 
said RelNScrEv_flight
hello 
to 
my 
family 
, 
who 
was 
waiting RelNScrEv_flight
at 
the 
airport 
in 
california

<end_of_story>_flight 
two 
weeks 
ago 
i 
went RelNScrEv_flight
on 
a 
vacation 
to 
florida 
. 
getting RelNScrEv_flight
there 
meant 
having 
to 
fly+in+an+airplane Evoking_flight
! 
i 
arranged UnrelEv_flight
for 
a 
friend 
to 
drive ScrEv_get_airport
me 
to 
the 
airport 
, 
and 
drop ScrEv_get_airport
me 
off 
at 
the

i 
pulled UnrelEv_flight
a 
suitcase 
on 
wheels 
behind 
me 
and 
swung UnrelEv_flight
my 
small 
carry 
on 
bag 
over 
my 
shoulder 
. 
once 
inside 
i 
followed RelNScrEv_flight
signs 
and 
made ScrEv_go_check_in
my 
way 
to 
my 
airlines 
luggage 
drop 
off 
area 
. 
a 
man 
weight RelNScrEv_flight
my 
suitcase 
, 
put RelNScrEv_flight
a 
sticker 
on 
it 
, 
and 
whisked RelNScrEv_flight
it 
out 
of 
my 
sight 
. 
then 
i 
printed RelNScrEv_flight
a 
boarding 
pass 
and 
made RelNScrEv_flight
my 
way 
to 
the 
security 
line 
. 
there 
i 
waited ScrEv_wait
until 
my 
turn 
, 
showed ScrEv_present_ID/ticket
the 
security 
agent 
my 
id 
card 
and 
went UnrelEv_flight
to 
the 
walk+through ScrEv_go_security_checks
metal 
detector 
. 
finally 
, 
i 
could 
make ScrEv_find_terminal
my 
way 
to 
my 
gate 
where 
i 
waited ScrEv_wait_boarding
to 
be 
called ScrEv_listen_call
to 
board ScrEv_board_plane
. 
once 
on 
board 
the 
plane 
i 
found RelNScrEv_flight
my 
seat 
number 
and 
settled+in ScrEv_take_seat
comfortably 
. 
before 
i 
knew UnrelEv_flight
it 
we 
were UnrelEv_flight
in 
the 
air 
. 
a 
flight 
attendant 
gave RelNScrEv_flight
me 
a 
soda 
, 
and 
i 
relaxed+watching ScrEv_spend_time_flight
a 
movie 
until 
we 
finally 
landed ScrEv_landing
in 
florida 
three 
hours 
later 
. 
<end_of_story>_flight 
last 
year 
i 
went UnrelEv_flight
to 
visit RelNScrEv_flight
my 
cousins 
in 
california 
. 
since 
i 
live UnrelEv_flight
in 
new 
york 
, 
i 
had 
to 
fly+in+an+airplane Evoking_flight
to 
get 
there 
. 
i 
purchased ScrEv_get_ticket
a 
ticket 
at 
the 
ticket 
counter 
and 
then 
went ScrEv_find_terminal
to 
the 
gate 
where 
i 
would 
get ScrEv_board_plane
onto 
the 
airplane 
. 
i 
listened ScrEv_listen_call
carefully 
for 
the 
announcement 
that 
boarding ScrEv_board_plane
would 
begin 
and 
was UnrelEv_flight
first 
in 
line 
to 
get+on ScrEv_board_plane
. 
once 
i 
was UnrelEv_flight
on 
the 
plane 
, 
i 
put ScrEv_stow_away_luggage
my 
suitcase 
in 
the 
overhead 
compartment 
and 
found RelNScrEv_flight
my 
seat 
. 
i 
had 
chosen RelNScrEv_flight
a 
seat 
near 
the 
window 
so 
that 
i 
could 
easily 
see RelNScrEv_flight
the 
clouds 
and 
the 
cities 
below 
me 
. 
i 
sat+down ScrEv_take_seat
and 
put ScrEv_buckle_seat_belt
my 
seat 
belt 
on 
. 
before 
the 
flight 
could 
take+off ScrEv_take_off
a 
flight 
attendant 
had 
to 
give ScrEv_listen_crew
some 
important 
safety 
instructions 
. 
i 
listened ScrEv_listen_crew
carefully 
so 
that 
i 
would 
know UnrelEv_flight
what 
to 
do UnrelEv_flight
in 
an 
emergency 
. 
then 
i 
sat+back RelNScrEv_flight
and 
waited RelNScrEv_flight
for 
the 
plane 
to 
take+off ScrEv_take_off
. 
i 
was UnrelEv_flight
surprised 
by 
how 
loud 
the 
engines 
were UnrelEv_flight
when 
the 
plane 
started 
moving ScrEv_take_off_preparations
. 
when 
it 
took+off ScrEv_take_off
and 
rose+up ScrEv_take_off
into 
the 
air 
, 
i 
was UnrelEv_flight
so 
excited 
i 
could 
hardly 
stand UnrelEv_flight
it 
. 
this 
was 
going 
to 
be UnrelEv_flight
fun 
! 
<end_of_story>_flight 
this 
year 
for 
vacation 
, 
we 
decide UnrelEv_flight
we 
wanted UnrelEv_flight
to 
to 
ireland 
. 
well 
never 
having 
flown+in+a+plane Evoking_flight
the 
thought 
of 
flying Evoking_flight
was 
a 
bit 
frightening 
. 
we 
scheduled RelNScrEv_flight
are 
vacation 
and 
our 
nerves 
were 
getting UnrelEv_flight
the 
best 
of 
us 
all 
since 
this 
new 
to 
our 
family 
. 
the 
day 
arrived UnrelEv_flight
that 
we 
were UnrelEv_flight
to 
leave RelNScrEv_flight
, 
we 
arrived ScrEv_get_airport
early 
since 
we 
did 
n't 
know UnrelEv_flight
how 
long 
it 
would 
take UnrelEv_flight
to 
get+through Unclear_flight
all 
the 
checkpoint 
i 
the 
airport 
. 
we 
checked ScrEv_check_luggage
our 
bags 
and 
got+through ScrEv_go_security_checks
security 
and 
anxiously 
waited ScrEv_wait_boarding
to 
board ScrEv_board_plane
our 
plane 
. 
the 
kids 
we 
are UnrelEv_flight
anxious 
to 
get+aboard ScrEv_board_plane
and 
see UnrelEv_flight
what 
it 
was 
like 
, 
i 
, 
however 
was 
trying 
to 
convince UnrelEv_flight
myself 
this 
was 
going 
to 
be UnrelEv_flight
a 
fun 
experience 
. 
we 
finally 
got 
to 
board ScrEv_board_plane
the 
plane 
, 
we 
were 
directed RelNScrEv_flight
to 
our 
seats 
by 
the 
stewardess 
and 
we 
all 
sat+down ScrEv_take_seat
and 
got+ready ScrEv_other_flight
for 
take-off ScrEv_take_off
. 
the 
plane 
engines 
started 
to 
roar RelNScrEv_flight
and 
we 
taxied ScrEv_take_off_preparations
down 
the 
runway 
, 
the 
plane 
went ScrEv_take_off
faster 
and 
faster 
, 
looking ScrEv_spend_time_flight
out 
the 
window 
we 
could 
see RelNScrEv_flight
the 
ground 
dropping UnrelEv_flight
farther 
and 
farther 
away 
as 
the 
plane 
rose ScrEv_take_off
into 
the 
air 
. 
once 
we 
wereup UnrelEv_flight
in 
the 
air 
we 
realized UnrelEv_flight
there 
was UnrelEv_flight
not 
much 
to 
be 
frighten UnrelEv_flight
for 
and 
the 
excitement 
set+in UnrelEv_flight
to 
see 
a 
new 
country 
, 
we 
were UnrelEv_flight
on 
our 
way 
to 
ireland 
! 
<end_of_story>_flight 
i 
was 
headed UnrelEv_flight
to 
visit UnrelEv_flight
my 
cousin 
in 
italy 
for 
a 
few 
weeks 
. 
the 
week 
before 
, 
my 
dad 
went UnrelEv_flight
online 
and 
purchased ScrEv_get_ticket
me 
one 
of 
those 
convenient 
e-tickets 
. 
he 
printed ScrEv_get_ticket
it 
out 
and 
made+sure UnrelEv_flight
i 
remembered UnrelEv_flight
to 
bring RelNScrEv_flight
it 
on 
the 
day 
of 
my 
flight 
. 
we 
arrived ScrEv_get_airport
early 
to 
the 
airport 
so 
that 
i 
could 
go+through ScrEv_go_security_checks
all 
of 
the 
security 
checks 
. 
i 
had 
to 
take+off RelNScrEv_flight
my 
shoes 
and 
put RelNScrEv_flight
my 
belongings 
in 
a 
tray 
as 
i 
went+through ScrEv_go_security_checks
the 
scanner 
. 
after 
that 
, 
i 
saw RelNScrEv_flight
the 
board 
with 
all 
of 
the 
flights 
and 
saw UnrelEv_flight
that 
my 
flight 
was 
leaving ScrEv_take_off
soon 
. 
i 
waited ScrEv_wait_boarding
a 
few 
minutes 
by 
the 
gate 
with 
my 
parents 
until 
it 
was UnrelEv_flight
time 
to 
board ScrEv_board_plane
. 
many 
passengers 
climbed+aboard ScrEv_board_plane
and 
found ScrEv_take_seat
their 
seats 
. 
the 
captain 
greeted ScrEv_listen_crew
us 
over 
the 
loudspeaker 
and 
then 
the 
plane 
took+off ScrEv_take_off
. 
i 
was UnrelEv_flight
tired 
so 
i 
took ScrEv_spend_time_flight
a 
nap 
. 
when 
i 
woke+up ScrEv_spend_time_flight
i 
could 
see ScrEv_spend_time_flight
the 
clouds 
around 
me 
as 
we 
were RelNScrEv_flight
pretty 
high 
up 
in 
the 
air 
. 
after 
a 
few 
more 
hours 
we 
arrived ScrEv_landing
and 
everyone 
clapped ScrEv_spend_time_flight
. 
<end_of_story>_flight 
i 
was 
planning UnrelEv_flight
a 
relaxing UnrelEv_flight
vacation 
at 
the 
beach 
. 
there 
was UnrelEv_flight
only 
one 
problem 
: 
i 
did 
n't 
live UnrelEv_flight
anywhere 
near 
a 
beach 
! 
driving UnrelEv_flight
to 
one 
in 
a 
car 
would 
take+up UnrelEv_flight
too 
much 
of 
my 
fun 
vacation 
time 
. 
i 
had 
to 
buy ScrEv_get_ticket
tickets 
for 
an 
airplane 
ride 
, 
which 
would 
take RelNScrEv_flight
much 
less 
time 
because 
airplanes 
go UnrelEv_flight
very 
fast 
. 
i 
went RelNScrEv_flight
to 
the 
website 
of 
my 
local 
airport 
and 
found RelNScrEv_flight
the 
available 
planes+traveling Evoking_flight
to 
the 
city 
where 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_flight
to 
go Unclear_flight
at 
the 
time 
i 
was 
going UnrelEv_flight
on 
vacation 
and 
bought ScrEv_get_ticket
a 
ticket 
. 
the 
planes 
were UnrelEv_flight
ready 
to 
fly Evoking_flight
only 
at 
certain 
times 
. 
when 
it 
came UnrelEv_flight
time 
to 
go Unclear_flight
on 
my 
trip 
, 
i 
packed+up ScrEv_pack_luggage
my 
suitcases 
, 
drove ScrEv_get_airport
to 
the 
airport 
before 
my 
plane 
was UnrelEv_flight
ready 
to 
fly ScrEv_take_off
, 
and 
parked UnrelEv_flight
my 
car 
. 
inside 
the 
airport 
, 
i 
had 
to 
go+through ScrEv_wait
a 
long 
line 
for 
security 
, 
so 
that 
they 
can 
make+sure ScrEv_go_security_checks
there 
are UnrelEv_flight
no 
dangerous 
items 
being 
taken+on Unclear_flight
the 
plane 
. 
the 
workers 
looked+inside ScrEv_go_security_checks
my 
suitcases 
with 
an 
x-ray 
machine 
and 
checked ScrEv_go_security_checks
the 
clothing 
i 
was 
wearing UnrelEv_flight
to 
make+sure RelNScrEv_flight
i 
was UnrelEv_flight
safe 
, 
too 
. 
when 
i 
was 
all 
done ScrEv_go_security_checks
in 
security 
, 
i 
had 
to 
find ScrEv_find_terminal
the 
gate 
for 
my 
plane 
, 
where 
it 
would 
be UnrelEv_flight
ready 
to 
pick ScrEv_board_plane
me 
and 
other 
passengers 
up 
. 
when 
it 
was UnrelEv_flight
time 
to 
board ScrEv_board_plane
the 
plane 
, 
the 
stewardess 
helped RelNScrEv_flight
me 
find ScrEv_take_seat
my 
assigned UnrelEv_flight
seat 
and 
put ScrEv_stow_away_luggage
my 
suitcase 
in 
the 
compartment 
above 
me 
. 
i 
buckled ScrEv_buckle_seat_belt
my 
seat 
belt 
and 
waited ScrEv_wait
for 
the 
plane 
to 
take+off ScrEv_take_off
. 
when 
all 
the 
passengers 
were+on+board ScrEv_board_plane
, 
the 
stewardess 
explained ScrEv_listen_crew
what 
to 
do RelNScrEv_flight
in 
an 
emergency 
, 
and 
the 
plane 
began UnrelEv_flight
to 
move ScrEv_take_off
. 
it 
became RelNScrEv_flight
very 
noisy 
and 
all 
of 
a 
sudden 
, 
outside 
the 
window 
, 
i 
could 
see UnrelEv_flight
the 
ground 
get RelNScrEv_flight
farther 
away 
. 
i 
felt UnrelEv_flight
like 
my 
body 
was 
being 
pushed RelNScrEv_flight
against 
my 
seat 
a 
little 
bit 
. 
after 
a 
few 
minutes 
, 
the 
plane 
stopped UnrelEv_flight
going+up ScrEv_take_off
and 
the 
stewardess 
told ScrEv_listen_crew
us 
we 
could 
take ScrEv_other_flight
our 
seat 
belts 
off 
. 
she 
offered ScrEv_spend_time_flight
us 
drinks 
from 
a 
cart 
, 
and 
i 
was 
able+to UnrelEv_flight
read ScrEv_spend_time_flight
a 
book 
i 
brought UnrelEv_flight
on 
the 
plane 
. 
i 
knew UnrelEv_flight
the 
ride 
would 
last Unclear_flight
a 
fair 
amount 
of 
time 
, 
so 
i 
made+sure UnrelEv_flight
i 
had 
something 
to 
do ScrEv_spend_time_flight
. 
after 
a 
few 
hours 
, 
the 
captain 
explained ScrEv_listen_crew
on 
the 
intercom 
that 
we 
were 
arriving ScrEv_landing
in 
the 
city 
. 
he 
told ScrEv_listen_crew
us 
to 
buckle ScrEv_buckle_seat_belt
our 
seat 
belts 
again 
, 
and 
the 
plane 
gently 
came+closer ScrEv_landing
to 
the 
ground 
. 
finally 
, 
i 
felt UnrelEv_flight
a 
bump 
as 
the 
plane 
arrived ScrEv_landing
at 
the 
airport 
in 
the 
new 
city 
. 
my 
plane 
ride 
was+over ScrEv_landing
, 
and 
my 
beach 
vacation 
was 
beginning UnrelEv_flight
. 
<end_of_story>_flight 
i 
arrived ScrEv_get_airport
at 
the 
airport 
with 
my 
luggage 
, 
identification 
, 
boarding 
pass 
, 
and 
some 
spare 
cash 
. 
i 
went+up ScrEv_go_check_in
to 
the 
front 
desk 
and 
asked RelNScrEv_flight
if 
my 
flight 
was RelNScrEv_flight
currently 
on 
time 
, 
and 
it 
was RelNScrEv_flight
. 
i 
waited ScrEv_wait_boarding
in 
the 
lobby 
for 
a 
few 
minutes 
until 
they 
announced ScrEv_listen_call
that 
the 
plane 
was 
now 
boarding ScrEv_board_plane
for 
my 
flight 
to 
california 
. 
i 
got+up UnrelEv_flight
with 
my 
luggage 
and 
belongings 
and 
walked ScrEv_find_terminal
towards 
the 
terminal 
. 
a 
worker 
scanned ScrEv_present_boarding_pass
my 
boarding 
pass 
with 
a 
special 
scanner 
, 
and 
i 
then 
took+off RelNScrEv_flight
my 
shoes 
and 
set RelNScrEv_flight
them 
in 
a 
bin 
that 
a 
worker 
handed RelNScrEv_flight
me 
, 
along 
with 
my 
carry-on 
luggage 
. 
i 
set ScrEv_check_luggage
my 
big 
suitcase 
onto 
a 
cart 
where 
it 
would 
be 
taken ScrEv_check_luggage
onto 
the 
plane 
as 
cargo 
. 
i 
walked+through ScrEv_go_security_checks
a 
body 
scanner 
manned UnrelEv_flight
by 
security 
guards 
and 
passed+through ScrEv_go_security_checks
it 
without 
a 
problem 
. 
then 
, 
i 
got RelNScrEv_flight
my 
carry-on 
luggage 
and 
shoes 
back 
and 
put RelNScrEv_flight
them 
on 
. 
i 
walked+through ScrEv_get_plane
a 
tunnel 
onto 
the 
airplane 
and 
sat+down ScrEv_take_seat
. 
i 
listened+to ScrEv_listen_crew
the 
instructions 
that 
were 
said ScrEv_listen_crew
over 
a 
speaker 
and 
the 
plane 
took+off ScrEv_take_off
after 
a 
long 
wait 
. 
then 
, 
i 
listened+to ScrEv_spend_time_flight
music 
on 
my 
smartphone 
and 
fell+asleep ScrEv_spend_time_flight
for 
the 
full 
four 
hour 
flight 
. 
when 
i 
woke+up ScrEv_spend_time_flight
, 
the 
plane 
was 
landing ScrEv_landing
and 
i 
looked+out ScrEv_spend_time_flight
my 
window 
and 
saw UnrelEv_flight
california 
. 
we 
had 
made Unclear_flight
it 
safely 
to 
our 
destination 
. 
<end_of_story>_flight 
my 
younger 
brother 
was 
turning UnrelEv_flight
twenty-one 
last 
month 
, 
and 
the 
family 
decided+on UnrelEv_flight
a 
trip 
to 
las 
vegas 
. 
we 
packed ScrEv_pack_luggage
our 
things 
, 
and 
had UnrelEv_flight
our 
grandmother 
drive ScrEv_get_airport
us 
to 
the 
airport 
. 
we 
had 
already 
purchased ScrEv_get_ticket
tickets 
online 
, 
so 
we 
went ScrEv_find_terminal
straight 
to 
the 
gates 
to 
find ScrEv_find_terminal
the 
waiting 
area 
for 
out 
flight 
. 
the 
tsa 
conducted ScrEv_go_security_checks
a 
minor 
inspection 
of 
out 
belongings 
, 
everything 
turned+out UnrelEv_flight
just 
fine 
. 
we 
waited ScrEv_wait_boarding
close 
to 
fifteen 
minutes 
before 
we 
were 
called+up ScrEv_listen_call
for 
boarding ScrEv_board_plane
the 
plane 
. 
after 
finding ScrEv_take_seat
our 
seats 
on 
the 
passenger 
jet 
, 
we 
were 
instructed ScrEv_listen_crew
by 
the 
flight 
attendants 
what 
we 
needed 
to 
do UnrelEv_flight
in 
case 
of 
emergency 
, 
and 
well 
as 
show ScrEv_listen_crew
us 
how 
to 
use ScrEv_buckle_seat_belt
out 
seat 
belts 
correctly 
. 
we 
were 
instructed ScrEv_listen_crew
to 
turn+off ScrEv_take_off_preparations
out 
electrical 
devices 
during 
take+off ScrEv_take_off
. 
before 
we 
knew UnrelEv_flight
it 
, 
we 
were ScrEv_take_off
in 
the 
sky 
, 
thousands 
of 
feet 
above 
the 
earth 
's 
surface 
. 
the 
flight 
did 
not 
have RelNScrEv_flight
any 
issues 
with 
turbulence 
. 
<end_of_story>_flight 
my 
family 
and 
i 
began UnrelEv_flight
by 
going+through UnrelEv_flight
the 
gruesome 
experience 
of 
the 
airport 
. 
523 
hours 
later 
we 
were ScrEv_board_plane
finally 
on 
the 
plane 
and 
ready 
to 
take+off ScrEv_take_off

we 
put+on ScrEv_buckle_seat_belt
our

belts 
and 
got 
mentally 
prepared RelNScrEv_flight
for 
the 
flight 
ahead 
. 
fortunately 
we 
were 
going RelNScrEv_flight
to 
disney 
world 
and 
were UnrelEv_flight
all 
ecstatic 
for 
the 
experience 
that 
was 
to 
come UnrelEv_flight
. 
the 
problem 
is UnrelEv_flight
that 
my 
brother 
has UnrelEv_flight
a 
major 
fear 
of 
heights 
and 
airplanes 
, 
and 
i 
had 
to 
sit ScrEv_take_seat
by 
him 
. 
i 
told UnrelEv_flight
him 
not 
to 
watch UnrelEv_flight
the 
movies 
about 
airplanes 
crashing RelNScrEv_flight
, 
but 
he 
never 
listens UnrelEv_flight
and 
frightens UnrelEv_flight
himself 
more 
with 
each 
scene 
. 
the 
pilot 
and 
flight 
attendants 
do UnrelEv_flight
a 
great 
job 
at 
catering ScrEv_spend_time_flight
to 
everyone 
's 
needs 
. 
the 
pilot 
keeps RelNScrEv_flight
the 
plane 
steady 
with 
very 
little 
turbulence 
making RelNScrEv_flight
a 
easy 
and 
safe 
ride 
for 
all 
. 
we 
arrive ScrEv_landing
at 
our 
destination 
and 
after 
a 
bumpy 
landing ScrEv_landing
we 
have 
arrived ScrEv_landing
in 
florida 
and 
are UnrelEv_flight
ready 
to 
go ScrEv_go_target_location
to 
disney 
world 
! 
<end_of_story>_flight 
last 
summer 
i 
decided UnrelEv_flight
to 
go UnrelEv_flight
to 
mexico 
with 
my 
cousins 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_flight
a 
nice 
vacation 
and 
we 
were 
very 
excited UnrelEv_flight
to 
go UnrelEv_flight
. 
in 
order 
to 
get UnrelEv_flight
to 
mexico 
, 
we 
had 
to 
fly+a+plane Evoking_flight
. 
i 
have UnrelEv_flight
no 
issues 
flying+a+plane Evoking_flight
. 
i 
usually 
fly+it Evoking_flight
constantly 
when 
i 
visit UnrelEv_flight
my 
friends 
in 
florida 
. 
my 
cousins 
, 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
, 
were UnrelEv_flight
n't 
too 
keen 
on 
flying Evoking_flight
. 
they 
were UnrelEv_flight
very 
nervous 
on 
the 
plane 
. 
i 
had 
to 
calm ScrEv_spend_time_flight
them 
down 
. 
the 
food 
we 
received RelNScrEv_flight
helped UnrelEv_flight
calm ScrEv_spend_time_flight
their 
nerves 
. 
eating ScrEv_spend_time_flight
distracted RelNScrEv_flight
them 
a 
little 
from 
our 
environment 
. 
everything 
was UnrelEv_flight
fine 
until 
the 
plane 
started UnrelEv_flight
to 
experience RelNScrEv_flight
a 
lot 
of 
turbulence 
. 
my 
cousins 
started UnrelEv_flight
to 
get+afraid ScrEv_spend_time_flight
again 
. 
in 
fact 
, 
the 
turbulence 
was UnrelEv_flight
so 
bad 
, 
i 
started UnrelEv_flight
to 
feel ScrEv_spend_time_flight
afraid 
as 
well 
. 
soon 
, 
the 
pilot 
announced ScrEv_listen_crew
that 
there 
was UnrelEv_flight
nothing 
to 
worry+about ScrEv_spend_time_flight
. 
a 
couple 
minutes 
later 
, 
the 
plane 
flew Unclear_flight
smoothly 
again 
. 
eight 
hours 
later 
, 
we 
arrived ScrEv_landing
at 
mexico 
. 
we 
were 
not 
only 
excited UnrelEv_flight
to 
be UnrelEv_flight
in 
mexico 
, 
but 
we 
were 
excited UnrelEv_flight
to 
be UnrelEv_flight
on 
solid 
ground 
again 
. 
<end_of_story>_flight 
last 
year 
i 
visited UnrelEv_flight
my 
friend 
across 
the 
country 
. 
i 
live UnrelEv_flight
in 
california 
and 
he 
lives UnrelEv_flight
in 
north 
carolina 
. 
i 
knew UnrelEv_flight
that 
i 
was 
n't 
going 
to 
drive UnrelEv_flight
all 
that 
way 
; 
i 
needed UnrelEv_flight
a 
more 
efficient 
option 
. 
i 
decided UnrelEv_flight
to 
start UnrelEv_flight
looking+up RelNScrEv_flight
how 
much 
a 
flight 
would 
cost RelNScrEv_flight
. 
i 
researched RelNScrEv_flight
what 
airlines 
provided RelNScrEv_flight
flights 
from 
the 
airport 
nearest 
to 
where 
i 
live UnrelEv_flight
. 
i 
then 
had 
to 
decide UnrelEv_flight
when 
exactly 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_flight
to 
fly+there Evoking_flight
and 
back 
, 
as 
some 
days 
can 
be UnrelEv_flight
cheaper 
than 
others 
. 
we 
settled RelNScrEv_flight
on 
the 
dates 
that 
worked UnrelEv_flight
best 
for 
both 
of 
us 
, 
and 
i 
booked ScrEv_get_ticket
the 
cheapest 
flight 
i 
could 
find RelNScrEv_flight
for 
a 
round-trip 
ticket 
. 
when 
it 
was UnrelEv_flight
time 
for 
my 
trip 
, 
i 
packed ScrEv_pack_luggage
my 
bags 
and 
coordinated RelNScrEv_flight
with 
a 
friend 
to 
give ScrEv_get_airport
me 
a 
ride 
to 
the 
airport 
. 
my 
friend 
picked ScrEv_get_airport
me 
up 
early 
enough 
so 
that 
by 
the 
time 
we 
got ScrEv_get_airport
to 
the 
airport 
, 
i 
would 
be RelNScrEv_flight
about 
an 
hour 
and 
a 
half 
early 
for 
my 
flight 
. 
i 
then 
had 
to 
check+in ScrEv_check_in
and 
go+through ScrEv_go_security_checks
security 
. 
because 
i 
only 
had UnrelEv_flight
one 
small 
suitcase 
, 
i 
did 
not 
have 
to 
check ScrEv_check_luggage
my 
bags 
. 
i 
waited ScrEv_wait_boarding
in 
the 
terminal 
for 
my 
flight 
to 
arrive ScrEv_landing
, 
reading RelNScrEv_flight
a 
book 
to 
pass ScrEv_wait_boarding
the 
time 
. 
when 
the 
plane 
landed ScrEv_landing
from 
the 
previous 
flight 
, 
i 
also 
had 
to 
wait ScrEv_wait_boarding
for 
those 
passengers 
to 
unload ScrEv_exit_plane
. 
they 
began 
calling ScrEv_listen_call
different 
sections 
to 
board ScrEv_board_plane
, 
and 
mine 
was UnrelEv_flight
one 
of 
the 
last 
ones 
. 
i 
easily 
found ScrEv_take_seat
my 
seat 
and 
stowed ScrEv_stow_away_luggage
my 
suitcase 
in 
the 
compartment 
above 
. 
i 
was 
sitting ScrEv_take_seat
in 
the 
middle 
row 
, 
and 
the 
other 
two 
passengers 
next 
to 
me 
were ScrEv_take_seat
already 
in 
their 
seats 
. 
when 
i 
got UnrelEv_flight
seated ScrEv_take_seat
, 
i 
went UnrelEv_flight
ahead 
and 
buckled ScrEv_buckle_seat_belt
my 
seat 
belt 
and 
awaited Unclear_flight
take+off ScrEv_take_off
. 
the 
flight 
attendants 
had 
to 
make ScrEv_take_off_preparations
all 
their 
checks 
and 
when 
it 
was UnrelEv_flight
time 
to 
go ScrEv_take_off
, 
we 
also 
had ScrEv_listen_crew
an 
overview 
of 
the 
emergency 
procedures 
. 
i 
did 
n't 
have UnrelEv_flight
too 
much 
room 
between 
myself 
and 
the 
seat 
in 
front 
of 
me 
, 
but 
there 
was UnrelEv_flight
a 
little 
tray 
on 
the 
back 
of 
that 
seat 
which 
i 
put+down RelNScrEv_flight
to 
use UnrelEv_flight
to 
hold UnrelEv_flight
the 
drink 
i 
ordered ScrEv_spend_time_flight
later 
. 
i 
made ScrEv_spend_time_flight
small 
talk 
with 
the 
passengers 
next 
to 
me 
and 
we 
shared ScrEv_spend_time_flight
our 
travel 
plans 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_flight
overall 
a 
decent 
flight 
, 
and 
we 
made RelNScrEv_flight
good 
time 
and 
arrived ScrEv_landing
with 
no 
issues 
. 
<end_of_story>_flight 
the 
first 
time 
i 
ever 
flew+in+an+airplane Evoking_flight
was UnrelEv_flight
last 
summer 
. 
my 
mother 
and 
i 
bought ScrEv_get_ticket
tickets 
and 
had+a+direct+flight Evoking_flight
from 
illinois 
to 
virginia 
to 
see UnrelEv_flight
my 
sister 
. 
i 
thought UnrelEv_flight
it 
was UnrelEv_flight
cool 
to 
see UnrelEv_flight
what 
this 
was UnrelEv_flight
like 
since 
i 
always 
wanted UnrelEv_flight
to 
walk UnrelEv_flight
through 
an 
airport 
. 
so 
in 
the 
523 
years 
i 
have 
been UnrelEv_flight
alive 
, 
i 
have 
only 
flown+in+an+airplane Evoking_flight
twice 
. 
we 
walked ScrEv_get_airport
into 
the 
airport 
and 
went+through ScrEv_go_security_checks
security 
and 
waiting ScrEv_wait_boarding
by 
the 
section 
where 
we 
would 
board ScrEv_board_plane
the 
plane 
. 
then 
we 
boarded ScrEv_board_plane
when 
the 
flight 
attendants 
said ScrEv_listen_call
the 
plane 
was Unclear_flight
ready 
. 
we 
put ScrEv_stow_away_luggage
our 
luggage 
under 
our 
seats 
and 
fastened ScrEv_buckle_seat_belt
our 
seat 
belts 
. 
the 
flight 
attendants 
spoke ScrEv_listen_crew
to 
everyone 
on 
the 
plane 
and 
told ScrEv_listen_crew
us 
the 
safety 
procedures 
and 
rules 
for 
being+on+the+plane Evoking_flight
. 
we 
were 
then 
towed+out ScrEv_take_off_preparations
to 
the 
runway 
and 
the 
plane 
took+off ScrEv_take_off
. 
i 
thought UnrelEv_flight
it 
would 
be UnrelEv_flight
a 
smooth 
ride 
, 
but 
boy 
was UnrelEv_flight
i 
wrong 
! 
the 
plane 
was RelNScrEv_flight
so 
bumpy 
taking+off ScrEv_take_off
and 
the 
plane 
was RelNScrEv_flight
loud 
. 
then 
we 
landed ScrEv_landing
523 
hours 
later 
and 
undid ScrEv_other_flight
the 
seat 
belts 
and 
grabbed ScrEv_retrieve_luggage
out 
stuff 
and 
we 
walked+off ScrEv_exit_plane
the 
plane 
and 
out 
of 
the 
airport 
. 
i 
enjoyed ScrEv_spend_time_flight
the 
ride 
and 
it 
was UnrelEv_flight
so 
cool 
flying+thought+the+clouds Evoking_flight
and 
being+up RelNScrEv_flight
so 
high 
. 
<end_of_story>_flight 
flying+in+an+airplane Evoking_flight
is UnrelEv_flight
pretty 
easy 
, 
provided UnrelEv_flight
that 
i 
've 
made Unclear_flight
it 
through 
the 
airport 
easily 
. 
all 
of 
the 
security 
can 
take RelNScrEv_flight
a 
while 
, 
but 
finally 
boarding ScrEv_board_plane
the 
place 
makes UnrelEv_flight
it 
worth 
it 
. 
i 
usually 
try UnrelEv_flight
to 
get ScrEv_take_seat
a 
window 
seat 
, 
since 
i 
can 
sit ScrEv_take_seat
still 
for 
the 
hour 
or 
so 
it 
takes RelNScrEv_flight
me 
to 
get+to RelNScrEv_flight
the 
state 
that 
my 
parents 
live+in UnrelEv_flight
, 
and 
i 
do 
not 
like 
having UnrelEv_flight
someone 
needing 
to 
slide+by ScrEv_spend_time_flight
me 
every 
ten 
minutes 
or 
so 
. 
once 
i 
'm 
seated ScrEv_take_seat
, 
i 
'll 
listed+to ScrEv_listen_crew
the 
stewardess 
explain ScrEv_listen_crew
how 
the 
seat 
belt 
works ScrEv_buckle_seat_belt
and 
the 
other 
safety 
instructions 
as 
the 
plane 
takes+off ScrEv_take_off
. 
it 
can 
be UnrelEv_flight
a 
little 
bumpy 
at 
first 
, 
but 
i 
usually 
take RelNScrEv_flight
a 
motion 
sickness 
pill 
before 
getting+on ScrEv_board_plane
so 
it 
does 
n't 
bother UnrelEv_flight
me 
that 
much 
. 
then 
i 
spend ScrEv_spend_time_flight
the 
flight 
listening+to ScrEv_spend_time_flight
music 
, 
reading ScrEv_spend_time_flight
something 
on 
my 
nook 
, 
or 
playing ScrEv_spend_time_flight
a 
game 
on 
my 
ds 
. 
flying+in+an+airplane Evoking_flight
can 
be UnrelEv_flight
pretty 
relaxing ScrEv_spend_time_flight
when 
i 
just 
tune ScrEv_spend_time_flight
everyone 
else 
out 
. 
plus 
, 
i 
get UnrelEv_flight
to 
watch ScrEv_spend_time_flight
the 
clouds 
out 
of 
the 
window 
too 
. 
<end_of_story>_flight 
last 
week 
i 
flew+on+an+airplane Evoking_flight
to 
visit UnrelEv_flight
my 
aunt 
. 
first 
i 
made+sure UnrelEv_flight
i 
packed ScrEv_pack_luggage
everything 
i 
would 
need UnrelEv_flight
in 
my 
suitcase 
and 
had UnrelEv_flight
a 
friend 
drive ScrEv_get_airport
me 
to 
the 
airport 
. 
i 
checked+in ScrEv_check_in
at 
the 
airline 
desk 
and 
gave ScrEv_check_luggage
them 
my 
suitcase 
to 
load RelNScrEv_flight
onto 
the 
plane 
. 
next 
it 
was UnrelEv_flight
time 
to 
go+through ScrEv_go_security_checks
the 
security 
checkpoint 
and 
head ScrEv_find_terminal
to 
the 
terminal 
so 
i 
could 
get+onto ScrEv_board_plane
the 
airplane 
. 
there 
were ScrEv_go_security_checks
no 
problems 
with 
security 
, 
so 
i 
headed ScrEv_find_terminal
to 
the 
terminal 
to 
wait+for ScrEv_wait_boarding
my 
flight 
to 
start+letting UnrelEv_flight
people 
get+on ScrEv_board_plane
the 
plane 
. 
on 
the 
way 
i 
bought RelNScrEv_flight
a 
magazine 
so 
i 
would 
have UnrelEv_flight
something 
to 
read ScrEv_spend_time_flight
. 
once 
i 
found RelNScrEv_flight
a 
seat 
in 
the 
terminal 
, 
i 
sat+back ScrEv_wait_boarding
and 
started UnrelEv_flight
to 
look+through ScrEv_spend_time_flight
my 
magazine 
. 
after 
about 
523 
minutes 
the 
plane 
started UnrelEv_flight
loading ScrEv_take_off_preparations
. 
i 
got ScrEv_wait
in 
line 
, 
showed ScrEv_present_ID/ticket
my 
ticket 
and 
headed+down ScrEv_board_plane
the 
walkway 
into 
the 
plane 
. 
when 
i 
found ScrEv_take_seat
my 
seat 
, 
i 
was UnrelEv_flight
happy 
to 
see UnrelEv_flight
it 
was UnrelEv_flight
by 
a 
window 
so 
i 
could 
look+out ScrEv_spend_time_flight
as 
we 
went ScrEv_take_off
. 
it 
took UnrelEv_flight
about 
523 
minutes 
to 
get UnrelEv_flight
everyone 
settled+in ScrEv_take_seat
, 
then 
it 
was UnrelEv_flight
time 
to 
go ScrEv_take_off
. 
the 
flight 
attendant 
told ScrEv_listen_crew
us 
where 
the 
exits 
were UnrelEv_flight
, 
then 
we 
buckled ScrEv_buckle_seat_belt
our 
seatbelts 
and 
the 
plane 
started UnrelEv_flight
moving ScrEv_take_off
. 
the 
captain 
announced ScrEv_listen_crew
that 
the 
weather 
was UnrelEv_flight
good 
and 
we 
should 
have+a+great+flight Evoking_flight
. 
then 
he 
brought ScrEv_take_off_preparations
the 
engines 
up 
to 
full 
and 
we 
headed+down ScrEv_take_off
the 
runway 
and 
lifted+off ScrEv_take_off
into 
the 
sky 
. 
once 
we 
could 
take ScrEv_other_flight
our 
seatbelts 
off 
, 
i 
got ScrEv_spend_time_flight
a 
soda 
from 
the 
flight 
attendant 
and 
got ScrEv_spend_time_flight
my 
magazine 
out 
. 
between 
reading ScrEv_spend_time_flight
and 
looking+out ScrEv_spend_time_flight
the 
window 
at 
the 
clouds 
below 
us 
the 
flight 
went Unclear_flight
quickly 
. 
i 
did 
n't 
even 
finish UnrelEv_flight
reading ScrEv_spend_time_flight
before 
it 
was UnrelEv_flight
time 
to 
put ScrEv_buckle_seat_belt
our 
seatbelts 
back 
on 
and 
land ScrEv_landing
. 
we 
all 
got+off ScrEv_exit_plane
the 
plane 
and 
headed ScrEv_get_destination_airport
to 
the 
baggage 
claim 
area 
to 
get ScrEv_retrieve_luggage
our 
suitcases 
. 
mine 
came+out ScrEv_retrieve_luggage
pretty 
early 
, 
so 
i 
grabbed ScrEv_retrieve_luggage
it 
and 
headed+out ScrEv_go_target_location
of 
the 
airport 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_flight
a 
great 
flight 
and 
i 
had UnrelEv_flight
a 
good 
time 
visiting UnrelEv_flight
my 
aunt 
. 
<end_of_story>_flight 
a 
few 
weeks 
ago 
, 
i 
flew+from+indianapolis+to+new+york Evoking_flight
. 
when 
i 
arrived ScrEv_get_airport
at 
the 
airport 
, 
i 
had UnrelEv_flight
with 
me 
one 
suitcase 
and 
my 
purse 
, 
and 
i 
made+sure UnrelEv_flight
that 
my 
driver 
's 
license 
and 
airplane 
ticket 
were RelNScrEv_flight
handy 
in 
my 
purse 
. 
at 
the 
airport 
, 
i 
parked RelNScrEv_flight
in 
the 
parking 
garage 
and 
made UnrelEv_flight
a 
note 
about 
where 
my 
car 
was UnrelEv_flight
so 
that 
i 
could 
find UnrelEv_flight
it 
when 
i 
returned Unclear_flight
. 
then 
i 
walked ScrEv_get_airport
across 
the 
bridge 
from 
the 
parking 
garage 
to 
the 
airport 
terminal 
, 
where 
i 
went+to ScrEv_go_check_in
the 
check-in 
desk 
for 
my 
airline 
, 
delta 
. 
at 
the 
check-in 
desk 
, 
i 
gave ScrEv_check_in
my 
driver 
's 
license 
and 
my 
plane 
ticket 
to 
the 
clerk 
, 
who 
checked ScrEv_check_in
them 
to 
make+sure UnrelEv_flight
i 
was UnrelEv_flight
who 
i 
said UnrelEv_flight
i 
was UnrelEv_flight
. 
she 
took ScrEv_check_luggage
my 
suitcase 
and 
gave ScrEv_check_luggage
me 
a 
claim 
ticket 
so 
that 
i 
could 
get ScrEv_retrieve_luggage
it 
back 
when 
i 
got ScrEv_landing
to 
new 
york 
. 
then 
i 
went+to ScrEv_go_security_checks
security 
, 
where 
i 
had UnrelEv_flight
to 
put RelNScrEv_flight
my 
purse 
and 
coat 
and 
shoes 
into 
pins 
that 
would 
go+through ScrEv_go_security_checks
an 
x-ray 
machine 
while 
i 
walked+through ScrEv_go_security_checks
a 
metal 
detector 
. 
on 
the 
other 
side 
of 
the 
metal 
detector 
, 
i 
collected RelNScrEv_flight
my 
belongings 
and 
then 
found ScrEv_find_terminal
the 
gate 
-lrb- 
that 
is UnrelEv_flight
, 
the 
area 
where 
my 
particular 
plane 
would 
be 
loading+up ScrEv_take_off_preparations
-rrb- 
. 
i 
sat ScrEv_wait_boarding
in 
a 
waiting ScrEv_wait_boarding
area 
at 
the 
gate 
until 
the 
airport 
attendant 
told ScrEv_listen_call
us 
it 
was UnrelEv_flight
time 
to 
board ScrEv_board_plane
the 
plane 
. 
while 
i 
was 
waiting ScrEv_wait_boarding
, 
i 
used UnrelEv_flight
my 
cell 
phone 
to 
let UnrelEv_flight
my 
husband 
know UnrelEv_flight
i 
had 
gotten+to ScrEv_get_airport
the 
airport 
safely 
, 
then 
i 
read RelNScrEv_flight
a 
book 
for 
a 
while 
. 
when 
they 
called ScrEv_listen_call
us 
to 
board ScrEv_board_plane
the 
plane 
, 
i 
got ScrEv_wait
in 
line 
and 
we 
walked+down ScrEv_board_plane
a 
long 
ramp 
to 
get+onto ScrEv_board_plane
the 
plane 
. 
on 
the 
plane 
, 
we 
walked+back ScrEv_take_seat
to 
our 
assigned RelNScrEv_flight
seats 
. 
i 
had ScrEv_take_seat
a 
seat 
next 
to 
the 
window 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_flight
very 
sunny 
, 
so 
i 
pulled+down RelNScrEv_flight
the 
shade 
on 
the 
window 
. 
the 
person 
sitting ScrEv_take_seat
next 
to 
me 
said UnrelEv_flight
she 
was 
going 
to 
sleep ScrEv_spend_time_flight
and 
that 
i 
should 
wake RelNScrEv_flight
her 
up 
if 
she 
snored ScrEv_spend_time_flight
. 
in 
a 
few 
minutes 
, 
the 
plane 
started UnrelEv_flight
taxiing ScrEv_take_off_preparations
, 
that 
is UnrelEv_flight
, 
driving+around ScrEv_take_off_preparations
on 
the 
ground 
to 
get+up ScrEv_take_off_preparations
speed 
. 
then 
we 
took+off ScrEv_take_off
and 
climbed+up ScrEv_take_off
through 
the 
clouds 
. 
once 
the 
plane 
was Unclear_flight
above 
the 
clouds 
, 
i 
mostly 
looked+out ScrEv_spend_time_flight
the 
window 
, 
because 
i 
always 
enjoy UnrelEv_flight
looking+at ScrEv_spend_time_flight
the 
clouds 
from 
above 
and 
catching ScrEv_spend_time_flight
occasional 
glimpses 
of 
the 
ground 
below 
. 
during 
the 
flight 
, 
the 
attendants 
brought ScrEv_spend_time_flight
us 
drinks 
, 
so 
i 
enjoyed ScrEv_spend_time_flight
a 
cup 
of 
coffee 
. 
the 
person 
next 
to 
me 
did 
snore ScrEv_spend_time_flight
a 
little 
, 
but 
it 
did 
n't 
bother UnrelEv_flight
me 
, 
so 
i 
did 
n't 
wake RelNScrEv_flight
her 
up 
. 
after 
about 
an 
hour 
and 
523 
minutes 
, 
we 
landed ScrEv_landing
in 
new 
york 
. 
<end_of_story>_flight 
flying+in+an+airplane Evoking_flight
can 
be UnrelEv_flight
a

523 
hours

you 
get+through ScrEv_go_security_checks
security 
in 
a

pillow 
in

beverages 
after 
you 
go+through ScrEv_go_security_checks
security 
to 
take+on RelNScrEv_flight
the 
plane 
with 
you 
.

through

you 
can 
head+to ScrEv_find_terminal
your

wait ScrEv_wait_boarding
until 
your

boarding ScrEv_board_plane
. 
when

the

, 
stow+away ScrEv_stow_away_luggage
your

, 
and 
sit+back ScrEv_take_seat

the 
rest 
of

work 
will 
be 
done UnrelEv_flight
for 
you 
, 
and 
you 
can 
feel UnrelEv_flight
free 
to 
take ScrEv_spend_time_flight
a

watch ScrEv_spend_time_flight
an

movie 
. 
when

had 
always 
been UnrelEv_flight
nervous 
about 
flying Evoking_flight
and 
had 
never 
been+on+an+airplane Evoking_flight
, 
so 
i 
was UnrelEv_flight
very 
nervous 
when 
i 
realized UnrelEv_flight
i 
had 
to 
fly Evoking_flight
for 
a 
business 
trip 
a 
while 
back 
. 
i 
did UnrelEv_flight
research 
on 
the 
internet

once

felt UnrelEv_flight
reasonably 
comfortable 
i 
went RelNScrEv_flight
on

travel 
website

i 
found RelNScrEv_flight
the

times 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_flight
between 
the 
airports 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_flight
, 
i 
input RelNScrEv_flight
my 
information 
into 
the 
website 
and 
booked ScrEv_get_ticket
the 
flights 
. 
on 
the 
day 
of 
flight 
, 
i 
made+sure UnrelEv_flight
to 
get+to ScrEv_get_airport
the 
airport 
a 
couple 
hours 
early 
. 
i 
went+through ScrEv_go_security_checks
security

checked ScrEv_check_luggage
my 
bags 
. 
finally 
, 
they 
called ScrEv_listen_call
for 
boarding ScrEv_board_plane
. 
i 
walked+down ScrEv_board_plane
the 
walkway 
and 
onto 
the 
plane 
. 
i 
found ScrEv_take_seat
my 
seat

placed ScrEv_stow_away_luggage
my

on 
luggage 
in 
the 
overhead 
compartment

i 
sat+down ScrEv_take_seat

the

i 
fastened ScrEv_buckle_seat_belt

we 
took+off ScrEv_take_off

climbed ScrEv_take_off

the 
day

always 
make+sure UnrelEv_flight

<end_of_story>_flight 
i 
was 
so 
scared UnrelEv_flight
to 
find+out UnrelEv_flight
that 
i 
had 
to 
go+on+the+airplane Evoking_flight
to 
visit UnrelEv_flight
my 
grandmother 
. 
she 
had 
been UnrelEv_flight
very 
sick 
and 
in 
the 
hospital 
for 
awhile 
now 
so 
i 
owed UnrelEv_flight
it 
to 
her 
. 
i 
would 
have 
taken UnrelEv_flight
the 
bus 
but 
it 
was UnrelEv_flight
at 
least 
a 
twenty 
four 
hour 
journey 
if 
driving UnrelEv_flight
. 
i 
searched RelNScrEv_flight
some 
popular 
sites 
online 
and 
found ScrEv_get_ticket
the 
perfect 
flight 
deal 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_flight
a 
round 
trip 
flight 
from 
new 
york 
to 
orlando 
and 
it 
would 
only 
take RelNScrEv_flight
four 
hours 
. 
i 
was 
scheduled UnrelEv_flight
to 
leave ScrEv_take_off
the 
following UnrelEv_flight
morning 
so 
i 
packed ScrEv_pack_luggage
just 
enough 
stuff 
to 
fit UnrelEv_flight
on 
a 
carryon 
bag 
. 
the 
airline 
charged RelNScrEv_flight
extra 
money 
based+on UnrelEv_flight
how 
many 
bags 
you 
had UnrelEv_flight
. 
carry 
ons 
were UnrelEv_flight
free 
and 
i 
was 
only 
staying UnrelEv_flight
for 
two 
days 
so 
things 
worked+out UnrelEv_flight
great 
. 
i 
arrived ScrEv_get_airport
and 
the 
busy 
airport 
an 
hour 
long 
, 
went+through ScrEv_go_security_checks
the 
security 
part 
which 
took UnrelEv_flight
the 
longest 
. 
i 
had UnrelEv_flight
just 
minutes 
before 
my 
flight 
would 
board ScrEv_board_plane
and 
my 
nerves 
were 
getting RelNScrEv_flight
the 
best 
of 
me 
. 
but 
once 
i 
got+on ScrEv_board_plane
things 
were UnrelEv_flight
great 
. 
i 
had ScrEv_take_seat
a 
window 
seat 
but 
never 
looked+out ScrEv_spend_time_flight
to 
see ScrEv_spend_time_flight
the 
clouds 
. 
the 
flight 
attendants 
were UnrelEv_flight
great 
and 
offered ScrEv_spend_time_flight
me 
drinks 
and 
snacks 
. 
my 
ears 
rang RelNScrEv_flight
a 
little 
but 
the 
gum 
i 
chewed ScrEv_spend_time_flight
helped RelNScrEv_flight
. 
there 
was RelNScrEv_flight
n't 
any 
turbulence 
and 
i 
was Unclear_flight
by 
my 
grandmothers 
side 
before 
i 
knew UnrelEv_flight
it 
. 
so 
glad 
to 
have 
been 
able 
to 
overcome UnrelEv_flight
my 
fears 
. 
<end_of_story>_flight 
i 
walked+onto ScrEv_board_plane
the 
plane 
and 
was 
greeted ScrEv_listen_crew
by 
the 
stewardess 
who 
had UnrelEv_flight
a 
very 
kind 
smile 
. 
i 
walked ScrEv_board_plane
slowly 
behind 
the 
other 
passengers 
as 
people 
were 
shoving ScrEv_stow_away_luggage
their 
luggage 
into 
the 
overhead 
compartments 
. 
i 
found ScrEv_take_seat
my 
seat 
just 
ahead 
of 
the 
right 
wing 
. 
i 
buckled+into ScrEv_buckle_seat_belt
my 
seat 
next 
to 
the 
window 
, 
and 
prepared ScrEv_take_off_preparations
myself 
for 
takeoff ScrEv_take_off
. 
the 
stewardess 
explained ScrEv_listen_crew
all 
the 
pre-flight 
information 
about 
safety 
. 
the 
plane 
started UnrelEv_flight
to 
taxi ScrEv_take_off_preparations
to 
the 
runway 
. 
my 
stomach 
started UnrelEv_flight
to 
get UnrelEv_flight
a 
little 
twisted 
. 
the 
engines 
started UnrelEv_flight
to 
roar ScrEv_take_off_preparations
and 
the 
passengers 
were 
pushed+back RelNScrEv_flight
into 
their 
seats 
. 
in 
a 
few 
seconds 
the 
plane 
started UnrelEv_flight
climbing ScrEv_take_off
and 
we 
were+off ScrEv_take_off
. 
i 
watched ScrEv_spend_time_flight
the 
the 
trees 
and 
the 
buildings 
get UnrelEv_flight
smaller 
and 
smaller 
. 
after 
a 
few 
minutes 
we 
started UnrelEv_flight
to 
level+off ScrEv_take_off
and 
everything 
on 
the 
ground 
looked UnrelEv_flight
miniature 
. 
we 
were Unclear_flight
above 
the 
clouds 
for 
most 
of 
the 
flight 
, 
but 
i 
still 
love UnrelEv_flight
looking+out ScrEv_spend_time_flight
the 
window 
. 
as 
we 
began ScrEv_landing
our 
descent 
, 
we 
went+through RelNScrEv_flight
rain 
clouds 
and 
it 
was UnrelEv_flight
a 
bit 
bumpy 
, 
but 
we 
landed ScrEv_landing
safely 
and 
exited ScrEv_exit_plane
the 
plane 
the 
same 
way 
we 
began ScrEv_board_plane
, 
slow 
and 
without 
efficiency 
. 
<end_of_story>_flight 
for 
my 
first 
time 
flying+in+an+airplane Evoking_flight
i 
ca 
n't 
say UnrelEv_flight
that 
i 
was 
too 
scared UnrelEv_flight
. 
i 
mean UnrelEv_flight
what 
could 
be UnrelEv_flight
so 
scary 
about 
being+in+a+plane Evoking_flight
. 
i 
was 
pumped UnrelEv_flight
and 
ready 
for 
my 
first 
flight 
. 
but 
first 
things 
first 
, 
i 
had 
to 
pack ScrEv_pack_luggage
my 
suitcase 
. 
with 
this 
finished ScrEv_pack_luggage
and 
my 
plane 
ticket 
purchased ScrEv_get_ticket
online 
-lrb- 
boy 
that 
's UnrelEv_flight
convenient 
-rrb- 
i 
began UnrelEv_flight
the 
long 
wait 
for 
departure 
day 
. 
when 
it 
came UnrelEv_flight
i 
rushed ScrEv_get_airport
to 
the 
airport 
in 
my 
car 
, 
maybe 
a 
little 
too 
fast 
according UnrelEv_flight
to 
the 
driver 
who 
honked UnrelEv_flight
and 
put+up UnrelEv_flight
a 
very 
rude 
message 
with 
one 
of 
his 
fingers 
. 
whatever 
, 
nothing 
can 
deter UnrelEv_flight
me 
from 
this 
flight 
. 
i 
arrive ScrEv_get_airport
at 
the 
airport 
and 
get UnrelEv_flight
processed ScrEv_check_in
. 
i 
jump ScrEv_board_plane
on 
my 
plane 
and 
wait ScrEv_wait_boarding
for 
departure 
. 
this 
is UnrelEv_flight
the 
moment 
i 
've 
been 
waiting+on UnrelEv_flight
. 
and 
then 
we 
set+off ScrEv_take_off
. 
and 
once 
i 
look+out ScrEv_spend_time_flight
the 
window 
i 
am 
terrified ScrEv_spend_time_flight
, 
i 
should 
have 
never 
done Evoking_flight
this 
. 
the 
flight 
takes Unclear_flight
a 
couple 
hours 
and 
then 
i 
am UnrelEv_flight
good 
. 
but 
i 
realized UnrelEv_flight
one 
thing 
. 
plane 
's 
are 
actually 
terrifying UnrelEv_flight
. 
<end_of_story>_flight 
last 
month 
i 
went+on+a+trip Evoking_flight
to 
mexico 
. 
i 
was+excited UnrelEv_flight
because 
i 
had 
never 
been UnrelEv_flight
to 
mexico 
or 
flown+on+a+plane Evoking_flight
before 
and 
i 
was 
going 
to 
get UnrelEv_flight
to 
do UnrelEv_flight
both 
. 
i 
booked ScrEv_get_ticket
my 
flight 
months 
in 
advance 
to 
be+sure UnrelEv_flight
i 
would 
have+transportation Unclear_flight
to 
my 
vacation 
destination 
. 
the 
day 
i 
was+about UnrelEv_flight
to 
leave ScrEv_take_off
i 
went+to ScrEv_get_airport
the 
airport 
hours 
in 
advance 
because 
i 
was UnrelEv_flight
nervous 
and 
excited UnrelEv_flight
. 
i 
checked+in ScrEv_check_in
at 
the 
correct 
terminal 
where 
the 
flight 
was 
supposed UnrelEv_flight
to 
leave ScrEv_take_off
from 
. 
a 
nice 
lady 
checked ScrEv_check_in
my 
ticket 
and 
confirmed ScrEv_listen_crew
that 
my 
flight 
was UnrelEv_flight
on 
schedule 
. 
i 
then 
proceeded ScrEv_go_security_checks
to 
the 
security 
check 
station 
where 
officers 
checked ScrEv_go_security_checks
my 
bags 
and 
personal 
belongings 
. 
after 
the 
quick 
screening ScrEv_go_security_checks
and 
a 
short 
wait 
my 
plane 
boarded ScrEv_board_plane
. 
i 
found ScrEv_take_seat
my 
seat 
next 
to 
the 
window 
and 
was UnrelEv_flight
full 
of 
excitement 
. 
after 
some 
short 
instructions 
the 
plane 
taxied ScrEv_take_off_preparations
the 
runway 
and 
then 
sped+up ScrEv_take_off_preparations
in 
a 
flash 
. 
i 
watched ScrEv_spend_time_flight
as 
the 
tires 
left ScrEv_take_off
the 
ground 
and 
we 
took ScrEv_take_off
to 
the 
sky 
. 
after 
several 
hours 
in 
the 
air 
the 
plane 
descended ScrEv_landing
and 
touched+down ScrEv_landing
on 
a 
runway 
in 
mexico 
. 
i 
was 
excited UnrelEv_flight
to 
get UnrelEv_flight
my 
vacation 
started UnrelEv_flight
. 
<end_of_story>_flight 
my 
wife 
and 
i 
flew+on+an+airplane Evoking_flight
a 
couple 
of 
months 
ago 
. 
we 
were 
going Unclear_flight
to 
las 
vegas 
because 
a 
friend 
of 
mine 
was 
getting+married UnrelEv_flight
. 
he 
lives UnrelEv_flight
there 
and 
said UnrelEv_flight
that 
he 
would 
pick ScrEv_go_target_location
us 
up 
from 
the 
airport 
. 
but 
, 
the 
weather 
here 
was UnrelEv_flight
cold 
and 
there 
was UnrelEv_flight
freezing 
rain 
, 
so 
our 
flight 
was 
delayed RelNScrEv_flight
for 
two 
hours 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_flight
kind 
of 
scary 
taking+off ScrEv_take_off
because 
the 
weather 
was UnrelEv_flight
still 
cold 
and 
rainy 
, 
but 
after 
two 
hours 
of 
sitting RelNScrEv_flight
there 
waiting ScrEv_wait
, 
i 
was UnrelEv_flight
ready 
to 
go ScrEv_take_off
. 
people 
on 
the 
flight 
were UnrelEv_flight
pretty 
happy 
to 
finally 
leave ScrEv_take_off
and 
a 
lot 
of 
people 
were 
having ScrEv_spend_time_flight
drinks 
. 
everyone 
was 
getting ScrEv_spend_time_flight
ready 
for 
their 
own 
little 
party 
in 
las 
vegas 
. 
the 
flight 
itself 
took RelNScrEv_flight
a 
little 
over 
four 
hours 
due 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
we 
had+a+non-stop+flight Evoking_flight
. 
i 
was UnrelEv_flight
glad 
i 
paid RelNScrEv_flight
the 
extra 
money 
for 
not 
making RelNScrEv_flight
any 
stops 
. 
six 
hours 
sitting ScrEv_spend_time_flight
on 
an 
airplane 
is UnrelEv_flight
more 
than 
enough 
for 
me 
. 
the 
flight 
was UnrelEv_flight
pretty 
uneventful 
except 
for 
the 
lively 
passengers 
, 
so 
that 
was UnrelEv_flight
a 
good 
thing 
, 
especially 
since 
my 
wife 
hates UnrelEv_flight
to 
fly Evoking_flight
. 
my 
friend 
ended+up UnrelEv_flight
still 
picking ScrEv_go_target_location
us 
up 
from 
the 
airport 
and 
we 
had UnrelEv_flight
a 
great 
time 
in 
las 
vegas 
. 
<end_of_story>_flight 
yesterday 
, 
i 
woke+up UnrelEv_flight
at 
523 
am 
because 
i 
knew UnrelEv_flight
that 
i 
had UnrelEv_flight
a 
flight 
to 
catch Evoking_flight
. 
i 
ate UnrelEv_flight
my 
breakfast 
and 
waited+for UnrelEv_flight
my 
friend 
wayne 
to 
pick UnrelEv_flight
me 
up 
because 
he 
was 
going 
to 
drop ScrEv_get_airport
me 
off 
at 
the 
airport 
so 
i 
could 
board ScrEv_board_plane
my 
plane 
. 
once 
i 
arrived ScrEv_get_airport
at 
the 
airport 
i 
showed ScrEv_present_ID/ticket
them 
my 
ticket 
for 
my 
flight 
to 
los 
angeles 
, 
california 
and 
they 
told UnrelEv_flight
me 
i 
would 
have 
to 
wait ScrEv_wait_boarding
a 
few 
minutes 
. 
i 
sat+down RelNScrEv_flight
and 
waited ScrEv_wait_boarding
and 
read UnrelEv_flight
a 
few 
magazines 
before 
they 
announced ScrEv_listen_call
that 
my 
plane 
was 
boarding ScrEv_board_plane
. 
i 
was 
checked ScrEv_go_security_checks
to 
see UnrelEv_flight
if 
anything 
was Unclear_flight
on 
me 
in 
the 
security 
area 
before 
entering ScrEv_board_plane
the 
plane 
. 
once 
i 
got+on ScrEv_board_plane
the 
plane 
i 
went UnrelEv_flight
to 
the 
window 
seat 
and 
sat+down ScrEv_take_seat
. 
i 
put+on ScrEv_spend_time_flight
my 
headphones 
and 
listened+to ScrEv_spend_time_flight
music 
for 
about 
an 
hour 
. 
i 
then 
was 
asked UnrelEv_flight
if 
i 
wanted ScrEv_spend_time_flight
food 
from 
the 
flight 
attendant 
. 
i 
got ScrEv_spend_time_flight
myself 
a 
sandwich 
for 
lunch 
before 
we 
arrived ScrEv_landing
shortly 
in 
los 
angeles 
. 
i 
got+off ScrEv_exit_plane
the 
plane 
and 
noted UnrelEv_flight
that 
i 
had UnrelEv_flight
a 
very 
pleasant 
flight 
. 
<end_of_story>_flight 
i 
've 
only 
ever 
flown+in+an+airplane Evoking_flight
once 
. 
i 
'm UnrelEv_flight
terribly 
afraid 
of 
flying Evoking_flight
, 
but 
i 
had 
enlisted UnrelEv_flight
in 
the 
us 
navy 
and 
i 
had 
to 
fly+out Evoking_flight
from 
pittsburgh 
, 
pennsylvania 
to 
chicago 
illinois 
to 
go UnrelEv_flight
to 
boot 
camp 
at 
recruit 
training 
command 
in 
great 
lakes 
, 
illinois 
. 
i 
remember UnrelEv_flight
getting+to ScrEv_get_airport
the 
airport 
and 
not 
being UnrelEv_flight
sure 
of 
where 
everything 
was UnrelEv_flight
, 
because 
i 
had 
never 
even 
been+to UnrelEv_flight
an 
airport 
before 
. 
i 
was UnrelEv_flight
really 
nervous 
about 
the 
flight 
, 
too 
, 
so 
everything 
just 
seemed UnrelEv_flight
to 
be 
happening UnrelEv_flight
all 
at 
once 
. 
after 
boarding ScrEv_board_plane
the 
plane 
, 
which 
was UnrelEv_flight
much 
smaller 
than 
i 
had 
expected UnrelEv_flight
, 
i 
sat ScrEv_take_seat
nervously 
waiting+for ScrEv_wait
the 
plane 
to 
start ScrEv_take_off
and 
fully 
expecting UnrelEv_flight
to 
die UnrelEv_flight
at 
any 
moment 
. 
i 
decided UnrelEv_flight
to 
sit ScrEv_take_seat
towards 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
plane 
, 
so 
that 
i 
would 
n't 
be UnrelEv_flight
the 
first 
to 
die UnrelEv_flight
if 
the 
plane 
crashed RelNScrEv_flight
, 
which 
placed ScrEv_take_seat
me 
right 
next 
to 
the 
wing 
. 
i 
also 
decided UnrelEv_flight
to 
sit ScrEv_take_seat
next 
to 
the 
window 
so 
that 
i 
'd 
know UnrelEv_flight
right 
away 
if 
anything 
went+wrong RelNScrEv_flight
and 
i 
'd 
have UnrelEv_flight
time 
to 
panic RelNScrEv_flight
before 
i 
hit RelNScrEv_flight
the 
ground 
. 
after 
waiting ScrEv_wait
for 
what 
seemed UnrelEv_flight
like 
an 
eternity 
for 
the 
plane 
to 
start ScrEv_take_off
, 
we 
eventually 
got+off ScrEv_take_off
the 
ground 
and 
i 
went+into ScrEv_spend_time_flight
full 
panic 
mode 
and 
stared+out ScrEv_spend_time_flight
the 
window 
for 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
flight 
. 
as 
we 
were 
starting+out ScrEv_take_off
over 
pittsburgh 
, 
i 
noticed UnrelEv_flight
that 
the 
ground 
really 
did 
n't 
look UnrelEv_flight
like 
what 
i 
expected UnrelEv_flight
. 
it 
seemed UnrelEv_flight
like 
there 
was UnrelEv_flight
water 
everywhere 
, 
like 
little 
lakes 
and 
ponds 
, 
whereas 
i 
expected UnrelEv_flight
to 
see UnrelEv_flight
streams 
and 
creeks 
because 
we 
have UnrelEv_flight
them 
everywhere 
in 
this 
area 
. 
we 
just 
seemed UnrelEv_flight
to 
keep UnrelEv_flight
going+up ScrEv_take_off
. 
we 
flew+up ScrEv_take_off
past 
the 
clouds 
and 
i 
could 
n't 
see UnrelEv_flight
the 
ground 
anymore 
. 
the 
sun 
seemed UnrelEv_flight
much 
lower 
in 
the 
sky 
than 
i 
thought UnrelEv_flight
it 
was UnrelEv_flight
. 
it 
kind 
of 
felt UnrelEv_flight
like 
i 
could 
reach+out UnrelEv_flight
and 
grab UnrelEv_flight
it 
if 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_flight
to 
. 
the 
sky 
got UnrelEv_flight
noticeably 
thinner 
and 
i 
could 
start UnrelEv_flight
to 
see UnrelEv_flight
stars 
and 
stuff 
. 
the 
flight 
itself 
was UnrelEv_flight
very 
calm 
. 
i 
did 
n't 
experience RelNScrEv_flight
any 
of 
the 
turbulence 
that 
i 
'd 
expected UnrelEv_flight
and 
i 
started UnrelEv_flight
to 
feel RelNScrEv_flight
a 
little 
bit 
better 
about 
flying Evoking_flight
. 
that 
was UnrelEv_flight
until 
we 
started ScrEv_landing
back 
down 
. 
i 
was 
terrified UnrelEv_flight
when 
we 
went+in UnrelEv_flight
to 
land ScrEv_landing
. 
the 
plane 
tilted+forward ScrEv_landing
and 
it 
felt UnrelEv_flight
like 
we 
were 
going ScrEv_landing
straight 
into 
the 
ground 
, 
and 
i 
started UnrelEv_flight
panicking RelNScrEv_flight
again 
. 
of 
course 
, 
though 
, 
everything 
was UnrelEv_flight
fine 
. 
we 
touched+down ScrEv_landing
gently 
and 
it 
was UnrelEv_flight
over 
before 
i 
knew UnrelEv_flight
it 
. 
but 
i 
promised UnrelEv_flight
myself 
i 
would 
never 
fly Evoking_flight
again 
. 
i 
only 
flew Evoking_flight
in 
that 
instance 
because 
i 
had UnrelEv_flight
to 
. 
<end_of_story>_flight 
after 
boarding ScrEv_board_plane
my 
plane 
and 
placing ScrEv_stow_away_luggage
the 
luggage 
in 
the 
luggage 
compartment 
overhead 
, 
i 
took ScrEv_take_seat
my 
seat 
in 
my 
coach 
section 
of 
the 
airplane 
. 
i 
luckily 
had ScrEv_take_seat
the 
window 
seat 
, 
meaning UnrelEv_flight
i 
had UnrelEv_flight
slightly 
more 
room 
than 
the 
two 
strangers 
next 
to 
me 
on 
my 
right 
. 
i 
was 
able+to UnrelEv_flight
fold+back RelNScrEv_flight
my 
seat 
a 
little 
bit 
to 
allow UnrelEv_flight
for 
myself 
to 
rest RelNScrEv_flight
my 
head 
and 
back 
from 
a 
rather 
long 
drive 
. 
i 
pulled+out ScrEv_spend_time_flight
my 
book 
and 
started UnrelEv_flight
reading ScrEv_spend_time_flight
as 
the 
plane 
took+off ScrEv_take_off
. 
about 
ten 
minutes 
into 
the 
flight 
, 
i 
decided UnrelEv_flight
taking ScrEv_spend_time_flight
a 
little 
nap 
would 
be UnrelEv_flight
appropriate 
and 
helpful 
during 
the 
five-hour-long 
flight 
. 
i 
fell+asleep ScrEv_spend_time_flight
for 
about 
an 
hour 
and 
continued UnrelEv_flight
to 
read ScrEv_spend_time_flight
my 
book 
. 
after 
my 
eyes 
got+tired UnrelEv_flight
of 
reading ScrEv_spend_time_flight
, 
i 
pulled+on ScrEv_spend_time_flight
the 
headphones 
and 
watching ScrEv_spend_time_flight
the 
movie 
being 
shown ScrEv_spend_time_flight
in 
front 
of 
all 
the 
passengers 
. 
the 
movie 
ended ScrEv_spend_time_flight
moments 
before 
we 
started UnrelEv_flight
landing ScrEv_landing
, 
where 
i 
would 
then 
grab ScrEv_retrieve_luggage
my 
belongings 
and 
head+off ScrEv_exit_plane
the 
plane 
. 
<end_of_story>_flight 
i 
decided UnrelEv_flight
to 
take+a+trip+to+europe Evoking_flight
. 
first 
, 
i 
went RelNScrEv_flight
online 
and 
found ScrEv_get_ticket
tickets 
to 
the 
destination 
, 
bulgaria 
. 
then 
, 
i 
purchased ScrEv_get_ticket
those 
online 
tickets 
with 
my 
credit 
card 
and 
printed+out ScrEv_get_ticket
the 
receipt 
with 
my 
printer 
. 
i 
went RelNScrEv_flight
into 
my 
bedroom 
and 
packed ScrEv_pack_luggage
all 
of 
my 
bags 
. 
then 
i 
called RelNScrEv_flight
a 
taxi 
. 
once 
the 
taxi 
arrived RelNScrEv_flight
, 
i 
put RelNScrEv_flight
my 
bags 
into 
the 
trunk 
of 
the 
taxi 
and 
the 
taxi 
driver 
drove ScrEv_get_airport
me 
to 
the 
airport 
. 
at 
the 
airport 
, 
i 
waited ScrEv_wait
in 
the 
line 
for 
delta 
flights 
to 
check+in ScrEv_check_in
my 
bags 
. 
once 
my 
bags 
were 
checked+in ScrEv_check_in
, 
i 
got ScrEv_other_flight
my 
boarding 
pass 
. 
next 
, 
i 
went+to ScrEv_go_security_checks
the 
second 
floor 
of 
the 
airport 
terminal 
, 
where 
my 
carry 
on 
luggage 
was 
scanned ScrEv_go_security_checks
and 
i 
was 
searched ScrEv_go_security_checks
. 
then 
, 
i 
went+to ScrEv_find_terminal
my 
gate 
and 
saw UnrelEv_flight
the 
airplane 
waiting RelNScrEv_flight
outside 
on 
the 
loading 
arm 
. 
after 
523 
minutes 
, 
the 
stewardess 
made ScrEv_listen_call
an 
announcement 
that 
the 
airplane 
was 
boarding ScrEv_board_plane
. 
i 
got+on ScrEv_board_plane
the 
flight 
, 
took ScrEv_take_seat
my 
seat 
and 
the 
airplane 
took+off ScrEv_take_off
. 
then 
i 
flew+in+the+plane Evoking_flight
for 
523 
hours 
. 
<end_of_story>_flight 
back 
in 
december 
of 
last 
year 
, 
i 
flew+to+omaha+,+nebraska Evoking_flight
to 
visit UnrelEv_flight
family 
for 
a 
week 
during 
christmas 
. 
after 
packing ScrEv_pack_luggage
what 
i 
needed UnrelEv_flight
, 
i 
took ScrEv_get_airport
the 
bus 
to 
the 
airport 
where 
i 
had 
to 
get ScrEv_get_ticket
my 
ticket 
, 
go+through ScrEv_go_security_checks
security 
, 
get UnrelEv_flight
my 
suitcase 
checked ScrEv_check_luggage
, 
and 
find ScrEv_find_terminal
my 
way 
to 
the 
terminal 
to 
wait ScrEv_wait_boarding
until 
the 
called ScrEv_listen_call
for 
people 
to 
board ScrEv_board_plane
my 
flight 
. 
when 
i 
got+on ScrEv_board_plane
the 
airplane 
, 
i 
put ScrEv_stow_away_luggage
my 
luggage 
in 
the 
overhead 
and 
took ScrEv_take_seat
my 
seat 
that 
was UnrelEv_flight
fortunately 
near 
the 
window 
. 
once 
everyone 
was+on ScrEv_board_plane
the 
plane 
, 
the 
flight 
attendant 
announced ScrEv_listen_crew
that 
we 
were ScrEv_take_off_preparations
ready 
for 
take+off ScrEv_take_off
and 
instructed ScrEv_listen_crew
all 
of 
us 
to 
fasten ScrEv_buckle_seat_belt
our 
seat 
belts 
, 
turn+off ScrEv_take_off_preparations
our 
electronics 
, 
and 
read ScrEv_take_off_preparations
the 
safety 
manual 
. 
then 
the 
pilot 
told ScrEv_listen_crew
us 
that 
he 
was UnrelEv_flight
about 
to 
take+off ScrEv_take_off
and 
we 
then 
were 
finally 
flying ScrEv_take_off
in 
the 
sky 
. 
during 
my 
flight 
i 
sat ScrEv_take_seat
next 
to 
an 
older 
woman 
and 
her 
dog 
that 
she 
was 
allowed UnrelEv_flight
to 
keep UnrelEv_flight
on 
her 
lap 
. 
we 
talked ScrEv_spend_time_flight
throughout 
the 
flight 
while 
snacking ScrEv_spend_time_flight
on 
the 
peanuts 
and 
soda 
that 
were 
given RelNScrEv_flight
to 
us 
. 
when 
we 
finally 
landed ScrEv_landing
about 
three 
or 
four 
hours 
later 
, 
we 
all 
exited ScrEv_exit_plane
the 
plane 
in 
a 
single 
file 
line 
while 
grabbing ScrEv_retrieve_luggage
our 
belongings 
and 
once 
i 
was+off ScrEv_exit_plane
of 
the 
plane 
, 
i 
went UnrelEv_flight
to 
go UnrelEv_flight
find ScrEv_meet_people
my 
aunt 
who 
was 
suppose UnrelEv_flight
to 
pick ScrEv_meet_people
me 
up 
. 
i 
had 
enjoyed RelNScrEv_flight
my 
flight 
experience 
. 
<end_of_story>_flight 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_flight
to 
take+a+trip Evoking_flight
to 
see UnrelEv_flight
my 
friends 
. 
since 
they 
lived UnrelEv_flight
far 
away 
i 
decided UnrelEv_flight
to 
fly+in+an+airplane Evoking_flight
to 
go+see UnrelEv_flight
them 
. 
i 
went UnrelEv_flight
to 
an 
online 
website 
for 
the 
airline 
to 
book ScrEv_get_ticket
my

<end_of_story>_flight 
last 
friday 
, 
i 
took+an+airplane+flight Evoking_flight
to 
new 
york 
for 
a 
business 
trip 
. 
about 
two 
weeks 
before 
the 
trip 
, 
i 
went+online RelNScrEv_flight
and 
determined UnrelEv_flight
which 
airlines 
flew+to+new+york Evoking_flight
, 
and 
how 
much 
it 
cost RelNScrEv_flight
for 
each 
flight 
. 
after 
looking+at RelNScrEv_flight
all 
the 
possible 
flights 
, 
i 
decided UnrelEv_flight
to 
take+the+morning+jetblue+flight Evoking_flight
, 
which 
was UnrelEv_flight
also 
the 
cheapest 
. 
i 
bought ScrEv_get_ticket
the 
ticket 
online 
with 
my 
credit 
card 
, 
and 
printed+out ScrEv_get_ticket
a 
boarding 
pass 
on 
my 
printer 
. 
on 
friday 
morning 
, 
i 
got+up UnrelEv_flight

items 
i 
would 
need UnrelEv_flight
for 
the 
trip 
into 
my 
small 
travel 
bag

i 
had UnrelEv_flight
just 
a 
few 
minutes 
to 
make UnrelEv_flight
a 
cup 
of 
coffee 
, 
then 
drove ScrEv_get_airport
to 
the 
airport 
. 
i 
parked RelNScrEv_flight
in 
the 
parking 
garage 
, 
then 
made ScrEv_find_terminal
my 
way 
to 
the 
terminal 
. 
first 
, 
i 
checked RelNScrEv_flight
the 
flight 
information 
board 
to 
see UnrelEv_flight
if 
my 
flight 
was RelNScrEv_flight
on-time 
, 
which 
it 
was UnrelEv_flight
, 
and 
to 
find ScrEv_find_terminal
the 
departure 
gate 
. 
then 
i 
proceeded ScrEv_go_security_checks
to 
security 
, 
waited ScrEv_wait
in 
line 
, 
and 
then 
after 
clearing ScrEv_go_security_checks
security

for 
only 
ten 
minutes 
, 
and 
they 
called+for ScrEv_listen_call
general 
boarding ScrEv_board_plane
, 
so 
into 
the 
line 
i 
went ScrEv_wait_boarding
, 
and 
the 
gate 
agent 
scanned ScrEv_present_ID/ticket
my 
boarding 
pass 
as 
i 
entered ScrEv_board_plane
the 
jetway 
. 
i 
was 
greeted RelNScrEv_flight

i 
slowly 
made RelNScrEv_flight

we 
pushed+back ScrEv_take_off_preparations
from

was 
able+to UnrelEv_flight
get ScrEv_spend_time_flight
a 
cup 
of 
coffee 
during 
the 
short 
flight 
, 
and 
within 
523 
minutes 
, 
we 
were 
already 
beginning ScrEv_landing
out 
descent 
. 
the 
attendant 
collected RelNScrEv_flight
the 
empty 
coffee 
cup 
, 
and 
soon 
after 
we 
were 
touching+down ScrEv_landing
. 
it 
was Unclear_flight
a 
quick 
ride 
to 
the 
gate 
, 
seat 
belts 
off 
, 
and 
everybody 
got+up ScrEv_exit_plane
, 
grabbing ScrEv_retrieve_luggage
their 
luggage 
. 
after 
a 
slow 
crawl+up ScrEv_exit_plane

and 
a

gate 
. 
i 
waited ScrEv_wait_boarding

the 
airline 
woman 
checked ScrEv_present_ID/ticket

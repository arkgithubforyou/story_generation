'' 
i 
love UnrelEv_library
everything 
about 
libraries 
; 
their 
quiet 
atmosphere 
, 
comfortable 
chairs 
, 
and 
rows 
and 
rows 
of 
books 
on 
every 
topic 
. 
i 
do 
n't 
have UnrelEv_library
enough 
money 
to 
go+out UnrelEv_library
and 
buy UnrelEv_library
books 
whenever 
i 
want 
, 
so 
i 
often 
go ScrEv_get_library
to 
the 
library 
to 
borrow+books Evoking_library
for 
free 
. 
recently 
, 
i 
decided UnrelEv_library
to 
go ScrEv_get_library
to 
the 
library 
and 
just 
browse RelNScrEv_library
until 
i 
found RelNScrEv_library
something 
interesting 
. 
i 
drove ScrEv_get_library
to 
the 
library 
and 
parked UnrelEv_library
close 
to 
the 
door 
, 
since 
i 
expected UnrelEv_library
to 
leave ScrEv_leave
with 
an 
armful 
of 
heavy 
books 
. 
i 
walked RelNScrEv_library
inside 
and 
headed ScrEv_get_shelf
for 
the 
fiction 
section 
. 
i 
ended+up UnrelEv_library
in 
the 
row 
for 
authors 
with 
last 
names 
starting UnrelEv_library
with 
k 
, 
because 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_library
to 
find ScrEv_take_book
stephen 
king 
books 
. 
they 
ended+up+having UnrelEv_library
a 
dozen 
books 
by 
stephen 
king 
, 
and 
i 
selected ScrEv_take_book
three 
that 
i 
had 
never 
read RelNScrEv_library
before 
. 
then 
i 
went ScrEv_get_shelf
over 
to 
nonfiction 
to 
find RelNScrEv_library
a 
book 
on 
gardening UnrelEv_library
, 
since 
i 
wanted 
to 
learn UnrelEv_library
how 
to 
grow UnrelEv_library
tomato 
plants 
. 
i 
picked+up ScrEv_take_book
a 
gigantic 
, 
fantastically 
long 
book 
on 
how 
to 
grow UnrelEv_library
common 
vegetables 
and 
walked ScrEv_go_check_out
over 
to 
the 
reception 
desk 
. 
i 
handed ScrEv_show_card
the 
librarian 
my 
card 
and 
she 
checked+out ScrEv_register
my 
books 
. 
i 
gathered RelNScrEv_library
them 
up 
in 
my 
arms 
and 
walked ScrEv_leave
back 
to 
my 
car 
, 
excited 
to 
be 
able 
to 
read RelNScrEv_library
them 
all 
once 
i 
got ScrEv_leave
home 
. 
<end_of_story>_library 
the 
library 
is UnrelEv_library
one 
of 
my 
favorite 
places 
on 
earth 
! 
my 
mom 
takes ScrEv_get_library
us 
to 
the 
library 
at 
least 
once 
a 
week 
. 
i 
like 
reading RelNScrEv_library
so 
much 
that 
my 
mom 
asked ScrEv_ask_librarian
the 
librarian 
to 
give UnrelEv_library
me 
an 
adult 
library 
card 
so 
i 
could 
check+out ScrEv_register
more 
books 
. 
the 
kids 
card 
only 
allows UnrelEv_library
you 
to 
check+out ScrEv_register
two 
books 
a 
week 
, 
and 
only 
from 
the 
children 
's 
room 
. 
the 
adult 
card 
gives UnrelEv_library
me 
all 
access 
-lrb- 
at 
the 
librarian 
's 
discretion 
my 
mom 
said UnrelEv_library
-rrb- 
and 
six 
books 
a 
week 
! 
when 
i 
get ScrEv_get_library
to 
the 
library 
i 
like UnrelEv_library
to 
browse ScrEv_browse_releases
the 
new 
releases 
shelves 
. 
sometimes 
i 
ask ScrEv_ask_librarian
the 
librarian 
for 
a 
suggestion 
. 
if 
i 
have UnrelEv_library
a 
specific 
topic 
i 
want 
to 
read RelNScrEv_library
i 
might 
do ScrEv_use_computer
a 
search 
on 
the 
computer 
. 
once 
i 
have UnrelEv_library
the 
books 
i 
want UnrelEv_library
i 
take ScrEv_go_check_out
them 
up 
to 
the 
librarian 
along 
with 
my 
library 
card 
and 
she 
checks ScrEv_register
me 
out 
, 
reminding RelNScrEv_library
me 
of 
when 
the 
books 
are UnrelEv_library
due 
. 
<end_of_story>_library 
yesterday 
i 
went ScrEv_get_library
to 
the 
library 
to 
borrow+a+book Evoking_library
. 
i 
was UnrelEv_library
interested 
in 
learning UnrelEv_library
more 
about 
birdwatching UnrelEv_library
so 
i 
thought UnrelEv_library
the 
library 
would 
be UnrelEv_library
a 
great 
resource 
. 
i 
asked ScrEv_ask_librarian
the 
librarian 
where 
the 
books 
on 
nature 
and 
birds 
were UnrelEv_library
. 
she 
told RelNScrEv_library
me 
the 
call 
numbers 
of 
the 
aisle 
and 
i 
went ScrEv_get_shelf
to 
that 
aisle 
. 
each 
book 
had UnrelEv_library
a 
small 
sticker 
on 
the 
spine 
indicating UnrelEv_library
the 
call 
number 
. 
the 
books 
are 
organized UnrelEv_library
by 
subject 
, 
so 
reading ScrEv_look_for_book
the 
call 
numbers 
is 
helpful 
for 
finding RelNScrEv_library
things 
. 
i 
browsed ScrEv_look_for_book
through 
the 
books 
on 
birds 
. 
i 
picked ScrEv_take_book
one 
up 
and 
flipped RelNScrEv_library
through 
it 
. 
it 
had UnrelEv_library
a 
lot 
of 
beautiful 
photos 
and 
interesting 
facts 
and 
tips 
for 
watching UnrelEv_library
birds 
. 
i 
decided UnrelEv_library
this 
would 
be 
a 
great 
book 
to 
start UnrelEv_library
with 
. 
i 
brought ScrEv_go_check_out
my 
book 
to 
the 
circulation 
desk 
and 
waited ScrEv_wait
in 
line 
. 
when 
it 
was UnrelEv_library
my 
turn 
, 
i 
handed ScrEv_show_card
the 
librarian 
my 
library 
card 
. 
she 
scanned ScrEv_register
the 
book 
, 
opened+up RelNScrEv_library
the 
flap 
, 
and 
stamped RelNScrEv_library
the 
due 
date 
on 
the 
inner 
card 
. 
i 
'd 
be 
able 
to 
borrow+the+book Evoking_library
for 
three 
weeks 
. 
when 
the 
due 
date 
came UnrelEv_library
, 
i 
would 
return RelNScrEv_library
it 
to 
the 
front 
desk 
or 
the 
book 
drop 
box 
. 
<end_of_story>_library 
borrowing+a+book+from+the+library Evoking_library
is UnrelEv_library
a 
big 
responsibility 
. 
i 
got UnrelEv_library
my 
first 
library 
card 
when 
i 
was UnrelEv_library
in 
middle 
school 
. 
i 
could 
go ScrEv_get_library
right 
down 
the 
street 
from 
my 
house 
and 
explore RelNScrEv_library
everything 
the 
library 
had 
to 
offer UnrelEv_library
. 
my 
library 
has UnrelEv_library
books 
, 
magazines 
, 
computers 
, 
movies 
, 
anything 
i 
need UnrelEv_library
. 
i 
was 
searching ScrEv_look_for_book
for 
a 
book 
around 
halloween 
that 
had UnrelEv_library
some 
fun 
ghost 
stories 
. 
my 
library 
had UnrelEv_library
the 
exact 
book 
i 
wanted 
! 
the 
library 
also 
had UnrelEv_library
some 
others 
. 
i 
sat RelNScrEv_library
around 
a 
table 
with 
my 
pile 
of 
books 
and 
looked RelNScrEv_library
through 
them 
. 
finally 
, 
i 
could 
n't 
resist UnrelEv_library
and 
i 
went ScrEv_go_check_out
to 
the 
counter 
with 
the 
book 
i 
had 
come ScrEv_get_library
there 
for 
. 
the 
librarian 
was UnrelEv_library
really 
nice 
as 
she 
took ScrEv_show_card
my 
card 
and 
typed RelNScrEv_library
into 
her 
computer 
. 
i 
checked ScrEv_register
the 
book 
out 
for 
two 
weeks 
. 
this 
would 
give UnrelEv_library
me 
plenty 
of 
time 
to 
enjoy UnrelEv_library
it 
and 
best 
of 
all 
, 
the 
librarian 
let UnrelEv_library
me 
know UnrelEv_library
i 
could 
check ScrEv_register
it 
out 
for 
even 
longer 
if 
i 
needed UnrelEv_library
to 
. 
i 
would 
just 
have 
to 
bring RelNScrEv_library
the 
book 
back 
on 
the 
due 
date 
and 
have 
it 
scanned+out ScrEv_register
again 
. 
i 
took UnrelEv_library
great 
care 
of 
my 
book 
and 
returned RelNScrEv_library
it 
on 
time 
. 
libraries 
provide UnrelEv_library
a 
great 
service 
to 
me 
and 
my 
community 
and 
i 
'm UnrelEv_library
thankful 
i 
can 
go ScrEv_get_library
there 
and 
always 
find ScrEv_take_book
what 
i 
want 
to 
read RelNScrEv_library
. 
<end_of_story>_library 
i 
wanted 
to 
get UnrelEv_library
a 
knitting UnrelEv_library
book 
for 
one 
pattern 
, 
but 
did 
n't 
want 
to 
buy UnrelEv_library
the 
entire 
book 
just 
to 
access UnrelEv_library
three 
of 
its 
pages 
. 
i 
decided UnrelEv_library
to 
go UnrelEv_library
see ScrEv_look_for_book
if 
they 
had UnrelEv_library
it 
at 
the 
library 
. 
when 
i 
got ScrEv_get_library
there 
, 
i 
walked RelNScrEv_library
through 
the 
automatic 
doors 
and 
breathed UnrelEv_library
the 
smell 
of 
old 
paper 
. 
i 
walked RelNScrEv_library
over 
to 
a 
computer 
to 
look+up ScrEv_use_computer
the 
title 
i 
was 
seeking ScrEv_look_for_book
and 
jotted+down ScrEv_note_shelf
the 
area 
in 
which 
it 
could 
be 
found RelNScrEv_library
. 
luckily 
, 
it 
had 
n't 
been 
checked+out ScrEv_register
and 
i 
meandered ScrEv_get_shelf
over 
to 
the 
nonfiction 
section 
. 
i 
quickly 
found ScrEv_take_book
the 
book 
and 
took UnrelEv_library
some 
time 
perusing RelNScrEv_library
the 
selection 
. 
i 
did 
n't 
see RelNScrEv_library
anything 
else 
that 
perked UnrelEv_library
my 
interest 
and 
walked ScrEv_go_check_out
to 
the 
front 
to 
check+out ScrEv_register
the 
book 
. 
i 
decided UnrelEv_library
to 
use ScrEv_other_library
the 
self 
check 
out 
. 
i 
scanned ScrEv_other_library
my 
library 
card 
and 
then 
the 
bar 
code 
on 
the 
book 
. 
the 
machine 
gave RelNScrEv_library
me 
a 
receipt 
. 
i 
took ScrEv_get_receipt
that 
and 
the 
book 
, 
then 
left ScrEv_leave
. 
<end_of_story>_library 
today 
i 
took ScrEv_get_library
a 
trip 
to 
the 
library 
. 
the 
library 
is UnrelEv_library
so 
much 
fun 
because 
there 
are UnrelEv_library
so 
many 
different 
books 
to 
see RelNScrEv_library
there 
. 
when 
i 
got ScrEv_get_library
to 
the 
library 
i 
walked RelNScrEv_library
up 
and 
down 
the 
aisles 
looking ScrEv_look_for_book
for 
the 
perfect 
book 
for 
me 
. 
i 
wanted 
to 
read RelNScrEv_library
a 
book 
about 
horses 
or 
basketball 
. 
i 
asked ScrEv_ask_librarian
the 
librarian 
to 
help RelNScrEv_library
me 
find ScrEv_look_for_book
one 
. 
she 
looked ScrEv_use_computer
on 
her 
computer 
and 
found RelNScrEv_library
a 
great 
book 
about 
horses 
but 
it 
had 
already 
been 
taken RelNScrEv_library
home 
by 
someone 
else 
. 
so 
she 
looked ScrEv_use_computer
again 
and 
found RelNScrEv_library
a 
cool 
book 
about 
basketball 
. 
she 
went ScrEv_get_shelf
with 
me 
to 
the 
shelf 
and 
helped RelNScrEv_library
me 
find RelNScrEv_library
the 
book 
. 
after 
i 
got ScrEv_take_book
the 
book 
off 
of 
the 
shelf 
, 
i 
took ScrEv_go_check_out
it 
over 
to 
the 
counter 
and 
gave RelNScrEv_library
it 
to 
a 
lady 
behind 
the 
desk 
. 
she 
asked RelNScrEv_library
for 
my 
library 
card 
. 
i 
gave ScrEv_show_card
her 
the 
card 
and 
she 
scanned ScrEv_register
it 
and 
my 
book 
. 
then 
she 
gave ScrEv_get_receipt
me 
a 
slip 
of 
paper 
that 
said UnrelEv_library
i 
needed 
to 
bring RelNScrEv_library
the 
book 
back 
in 
two 
weeks 
. 
i 
was UnrelEv_library
very 
excited 
to 
leave ScrEv_leave
the 
library 
with 
a 
book 
to 
read RelNScrEv_library
about 
basketball 
! 
<end_of_story>_library 
i 
paid ScrEv_get_library
a 
visit 
to 
the 
library 
a 
couple 
of 
days 
ago 
. 
after 
getting UnrelEv_library
off 
work 
at 
5pm 
, 
i 
walked ScrEv_get_library
over 
to 
a 
library 
branch 
a 
couple 
of 
blocks 
from 
my 
home 
. 
i 
was 
looking UnrelEv_library
to 
borrow+a+novel Evoking_library
that 
i 
'd 
been 
meaning UnrelEv_library
to 
read RelNScrEv_library
for 
some 
time 
. 
i 
got ScrEv_get_library
there 
at 
around 
6pm 
. 
i 
first 
logged ScrEv_use_computer
onto 
one 
of 
the 
library 
computers 
to 
confirm ScrEv_check_catalog
that 
the 
book 
was UnrelEv_library
still 
there 
. 
after 
confirming ScrEv_check_catalog
this 
, 
i 
went RelNScrEv_library
upstairs 
to 
the 
fiction 
section 
, 
located UnrelEv_library
on 
the 
second 
floor 
of 
the 
library 
. 
once 
i 
was UnrelEv_library
in 
the 
fiction 
section 
. 
i 
walked ScrEv_get_shelf
over 
to 
the 
bookshelves 
and 
searched ScrEv_look_for_book
for 
the 
novel 
, 
successfully 
finding ScrEv_take_book
it 
fairly 
quickly 
. 
i 
then 
walk ScrEv_go_check_out
downstairs 
to 
the 
library 
's 
checkout 
desk 
. 
i 
placed RelNScrEv_library
the 
book 
onto 
the 
counter 
and 
also 
took UnrelEv_library
my 
library 
card 
from 
my 
wallet 
. 
i 
showed ScrEv_show_card
the 
librarian 
the 
card 
, 
where 
she 
then 
checked+out ScrEv_register
the 
book 
after 
scanning RelNScrEv_library
my 
card 
. 
next 
, 
once 
it 
came+out RelNScrEv_library
, 
she 
handed RelNScrEv_library
me 
a 
receipt 
where 
the 
return 
date 
was 
printed UnrelEv_library
on 
. 
once 
i 
received ScrEv_get_receipt
this 
, 
i 
walked ScrEv_leave
to 
my 
apartment 
with 
the 
novel 
in 
my 
hand 
. 
i 
was 
really 
looking UnrelEv_library
forward 
to 
reading RelNScrEv_library
the 
novel 
. 
<end_of_story>_library 
a 
friend 
of 
mine 
told UnrelEv_library
me 
about 
a 
book 
she 
liked UnrelEv_library
and 
i 
wanted 
to 
read RelNScrEv_library
it 
. 
i 
did 
n't 
want 
to 
buy UnrelEv_library
the 
book 
, 
though 
, 
so 
i 
decided UnrelEv_library
to 
go ScrEv_get_library
to 
the 
library 
. 
when 
i 
first 
got ScrEv_get_library
to 
the 
library 
, 
i 
had 
to 
register RelNScrEv_library
for 
a 
library 
card 
because 
you 
ca 
n't 
check+out ScrEv_register
books 
without 
it 
. 
so 
, 
i 
went RelNScrEv_library
to 
the 
front 
desk 
, 
filled+out UnrelEv_library
a 
form 
and 
then 
waited ScrEv_wait
. 
the 
lady 
at 
the 
desk 
made RelNScrEv_library
my 
library 
card 
right 
then 
and 
handed RelNScrEv_library
it 
to 
me 
. 
then 
i 
asked ScrEv_ask_librarian
her 
where 
i 
would 
find RelNScrEv_library
the 
book 
i 
was 
looking ScrEv_look_for_book
for 
and 
she 
showed RelNScrEv_library
me 
the 
right 
bookshelves 
. 
i 
located RelNScrEv_library
the 
book 
right 
away 
and 
took ScrEv_take_book
it 
from 
the 
shelf 
, 
but 
then 
i 
stayed UnrelEv_library
to 
look+around ScrEv_look_for_book
for 
more 
books 
. 
the 
library 
has UnrelEv_library
a 
card 
catalog 
where 
you 
can 
look+up ScrEv_check_catalog
any 
book 
you 
want UnrelEv_library
and 
the 
catalog 
will 
tell UnrelEv_library
you 
which 
shelf 
to 
go ScrEv_get_shelf
to 
for 
the 
book 
. 
so 
, 
i 
used ScrEv_check_catalog
the 
card 
catalog 
to 
find RelNScrEv_library
two 
more 
books 
and 
then 
took ScrEv_go_check_out
all 
my 
books 
back 
to 
the 
front 
desk 
to 
check ScrEv_register
them 
out 
. 
the 
lady 
at 
the 
front 
desk 
scanned ScrEv_register
a 
bar 
code 
in 
the 
back 
of 
the 
book 
and 
that 
registered ScrEv_register
them 
as 
checked+out ScrEv_register
to 
me 
. 
she 
told RelNScrEv_library
me 
i 
would 
have UnrelEv_library
four 
weeks 
to 
read RelNScrEv_library
them 
. 
after 
she 
was UnrelEv_library
finished 
, 
i 
picked+up ScrEv_take_book
the 
books 
and 
left ScrEv_leave
the 
library 
. 
<end_of_story>_library 
i 
needed 
to 
learn UnrelEv_library
about 
gardening UnrelEv_library
and 
was 
n't 
sure 
where 
to 
start UnrelEv_library
. 
a 
friend 
of 
mine 
recommended UnrelEv_library
a 
book 
. 
i 
decided UnrelEv_library
to 
check+it+out+from+the+local+library Evoking_library
. 
i 
walked ScrEv_get_library
to 
the 
library 
. 
inside 
there 
was UnrelEv_library
a 
computer 
to 
look+up ScrEv_use_computer
where 
books 
are 
located UnrelEv_library
. 
i 
typed ScrEv_use_computer
in 
the 
name 
of 
the 
book 
i 
was 
looking ScrEv_look_for_book
for 
and 
it 
showed RelNScrEv_library
me 
the 
call 
number 
, 
a 
unique 
number 
used UnrelEv_library
to 
tell UnrelEv_library
where 
the 
book 
is 
located UnrelEv_library
in 
the 
library 
. 
i 
wrote ScrEv_note_shelf
the 
call 
number 
down 
and 
looked ScrEv_look_for_book
at 
the 
stacks 
of 
books 
. 
each 
stack 
had UnrelEv_library
a 
range 
of 
numbers 
printed UnrelEv_library
on 
a 
card 
taped UnrelEv_library
to 
the 
side 
of 
the 
bookshelf 
. 
i 
looked ScrEv_look_for_book
for 
my 
call 
number 
on 
the 
printed UnrelEv_library
cards 
on 
the 
side 
of 
the 
bookshelves 
, 
then 
searched ScrEv_look_for_book
the 
books 
until 
i 
found RelNScrEv_library
the 
one 
i 
was 
looking ScrEv_look_for_book
for 
. 
i 
brought ScrEv_go_check_out
the 
book 
up 
to 
the 
front 
of 
the 
library 
. 
the 
librarian 
took RelNScrEv_library
my 
library 
card 
and 
scanned ScrEv_register
it 
and 
my 
book 
with 
a 
special 
scanner 
. 
she 
gave ScrEv_get_receipt
me 
a 
piece 
of 
paper 
inside 
the 
book 
that 
said UnrelEv_library
i 
needed 
to 
bring RelNScrEv_library
it 
back 
within 
523 
weeks 
. 
i 
brought ScrEv_leave
the 
book 
home 
and 
read RelNScrEv_library
it 
, 
then 
brought RelNScrEv_library
it 
back 
to 
the 
librarian 
. 
<end_of_story>_library 
i 
wanted 
to 
read RelNScrEv_library
a 
new 
novel 
, 
but 
rather 
than 
buying UnrelEv_library
it 
, 
i 
decided UnrelEv_library
to 
borrow+it+from+the+library Evoking_library
. 
when 
i 
arrived ScrEv_get_library
at 
the 
library 
, 
i 
was 
greeted UnrelEv_library
by 
the 
friendly 
librarian 
who 
asked RelNScrEv_library
if 
i 
needed UnrelEv_library
any 
help 
. 
i 
told ScrEv_ask_librarian
her 
which 
book 
i 
was 
looking ScrEv_look_for_book
for 
and 
she 
quickly 
helped RelNScrEv_library
me 
find RelNScrEv_library
it 
. 
after 
she 
helped RelNScrEv_library
me 
find RelNScrEv_library
the 
book 
, 
i 
walked ScrEv_go_check_out
to 
the 
checkout 
counter 
with 
the 
book 
. 
i 
handed ScrEv_show_card
the 
librarian 
my 
library 
card 
, 
which 
she 
scanned ScrEv_register
with 
a 
scanner 
. 
she 
opened RelNScrEv_library
the 
book 
to 
find UnrelEv_library
the 
bar 
code 
in 
the 
back 
cover 
and 
proceeded UnrelEv_library
to 
scan ScrEv_register
it 
. 
the 
computer 
printed RelNScrEv_library
a 
receipt 
which 
told UnrelEv_library
me 
that 
i 
had UnrelEv_library
two 
weeks 
to 
return RelNScrEv_library
the 
book 
. 
i 
placed RelNScrEv_library
the 
receipt 
inside 
the 
front 
cover 
of 
the 
book 
and 
thanked RelNScrEv_library
the 
librarian 
for 
helping RelNScrEv_library
me 
find RelNScrEv_library
the 
book 
i 
was 
looking ScrEv_look_for_book
for 
. 
<end_of_story>_library 
i 
needed 
to 
read RelNScrEv_library
a 
book 
for 
my 
history 
class 
, 
so 
i 
decided UnrelEv_library
to 
see RelNScrEv_library
if 
the 
local 
library 
had UnrelEv_library
a 
copy 
. 
i 
went RelNScrEv_library
to 
the 
library 
's 
website 
and 
searched ScrEv_check_catalog
for 
the 
book 
. 
i 
saw RelNScrEv_library
that 
they 
had UnrelEv_library
it 
in 
stock 
, 
so 
i 
walked ScrEv_get_library
to 
the 
library 
. 
when 
i 
entered RelNScrEv_library
the 
library 
, 
i 
walked RelNScrEv_library
over 
to 
the 
front 
desk 
and 
told ScrEv_ask_librarian
the 
librarian 
the 
name 
of 
the 
book 
i 
was 
looking ScrEv_look_for_book
for 
. 
he 
showed RelNScrEv_library
me 
where 
the 
book 
was UnrelEv_library
and 
asked RelNScrEv_library
me 
if 
i 
'd 
like 
to 
look ScrEv_look_for_book
for 
anything 
else 
. 
i 
said UnrelEv_library
that 
would 
be UnrelEv_library
all 
, 
so 
he 
took ScrEv_go_check_out
the 
book 
over 
to 
the 
front 
desk 
, 
and 
i 
followed ScrEv_go_check_out
. 
at 
the 
desk 
, 
he 
scanned ScrEv_register
the 
book 
and 
asked RelNScrEv_library
me 
if 
i 
had UnrelEv_library
a 
library 
card 
. 
i 
said UnrelEv_library
i 
did UnrelEv_library
and 
showed ScrEv_show_card
him 
. 
he 
then 
scanned ScrEv_register
my 
card 
, 
handed RelNScrEv_library
me 
the 
book 
, 
and 
told RelNScrEv_library
me 
it 
would 
be UnrelEv_library
due 
back 
in 
two 
weeks 
. 
<end_of_story>_library 
yesterday 
i 
went ScrEv_get_library
to 
the 
library 
to 
see RelNScrEv_library
if 
they 
had UnrelEv_library
the 
new 
stephen 
king 
book 
. 
i 
thought 
it 
might 
be 
already 
checked+out ScrEv_register
, 
or 
maybe 
they 
did 
n't 
have UnrelEv_library
it 
yet 
, 
but 
i 
wanted 
to 
check RelNScrEv_library
before 
i 
spent UnrelEv_library
the 
money 
on 
a 
hard-cover 
copy 
of 
the 
book 
. 
when 
i 
got ScrEv_get_library
to 
the 
library 
, 
i 
stopped UnrelEv_library
inside 
the 
doors 
and 
looked+around UnrelEv_library
for 
a 
few 
seconds 
and 
just 
took+in UnrelEv_library
the 
sights 
523 
the 
library 
is UnrelEv_library
one 
of 
my 
favorite 
places 
. 
i 
went RelNScrEv_library
to 
the 
card 
catalog 
and 
looked+up ScrEv_check_catalog
the 
book 
and 
, 
sure 
enough 
, 
the 
library 
had UnrelEv_library
two 
copies 
. 
i 
went ScrEv_get_shelf
to 
the 
shelves 
that 
had UnrelEv_library
the 
stephen 
king 
books 
and 
, 
to 
my 
great 
surprise 
and 
pleasure 
, 
there 
was UnrelEv_library
a 
librarian 
there 
re-shelving UnrelEv_library
books 
and 
one 
of 
the 
books 
in 
her 
hand 
was UnrelEv_library
the 
new 
stephen 
king 
book 
. 
i 
asked ScrEv_ask_librarian
her 
if 
i 
could 
have UnrelEv_library
it 
and 
after 
she 
handed RelNScrEv_library
it 
to 
me 
i 
went ScrEv_go_check_out
straight 
to 
the 
check-out 
desk 
, 
paid RelNScrEv_library
a 
twenty-five 
cent 
fine 
i 
had UnrelEv_library
from 
an 
overdue 
book 
several 
weeks 
before 
and 
checked ScrEv_register
the 
book 
out 
. 
i 
could 
n't 
wait UnrelEv_library
to 
get ScrEv_leave
home 
to 
read RelNScrEv_library
it 
. 
<end_of_story>_library 
i 
had 
finished UnrelEv_library
reading RelNScrEv_library
a 
very 
good 
book 
, 
and 
wanted 
to 
get ScrEv_other_library
a 
new 
one 
to 
read RelNScrEv_library
. 
i 
went ScrEv_get_library
to 
the 
library 
in 
my 
town 
. 
they 
have UnrelEv_library
rows 
and 
rows 
of 
books 
, 
some 
are UnrelEv_library
old 
, 
and 
some 
are UnrelEv_library
very 
new 
. 
i 
wanted 
to 
get ScrEv_take_book
a 
new 
book 
that 
my 
favorite 
author 
had 
written UnrelEv_library
not 
too 
long 
ago 
. 
i 
was 
hoping UnrelEv_library
that 
they 
would 
have UnrelEv_library
it 
, 
but 
it 
was UnrelEv_library
possible 
it 
was UnrelEv_library
on 
loan 
to 
another 
library 
patron 
. 
the 
books 
in 
our 
library 
are 
arranged UnrelEv_library
by 
the 
author 
's 
last 
name 
, 
so 
i 
went ScrEv_get_shelf
to 
the 
row 
of 
books 
that 
matches UnrelEv_library
the 
authors 
name 
. 
i 
found RelNScrEv_library
a 
large 
section 
that 
had UnrelEv_library
many 
of 
my 
favorite 
author 
's 
books 
. 
i 
looked ScrEv_look_for_book
carefully 
for 
the 
book 
i 
was 
searching ScrEv_look_for_book
for 
, 
and 
was UnrelEv_library
very 
excited 
that 
it 
was UnrelEv_library
there 
on 
the 
shelf 
. 
i 
was UnrelEv_library
very 
happy 
that 
it 
was 
not 
already 
checked+out ScrEv_register
. 
i 
took ScrEv_take_book
the 
book 
off 
the 
shelf 
, 
and 
looked RelNScrEv_library
for 
a 
while 
more 
to 
see RelNScrEv_library
if 
there 
were UnrelEv_library
any 
other 
books 
that 
i 
wanted 
to 
read RelNScrEv_library
. 
i 
found RelNScrEv_library
one 
more 
book 
that 
looked UnrelEv_library
really 
interesting 
, 
so 
i 
took ScrEv_take_book
that 
one 
off 
the 
shelf 
as 
well 
. 
when 
i 
was UnrelEv_library
done 
with 
my 
search 
, 
i 
brought ScrEv_go_check_out
my 
two 
books 
to 
the 
front 
desk 
. 
the 
librarian 
was UnrelEv_library
there 
to 
help UnrelEv_library
me 
check ScrEv_register
the 
books 
out 
. 
she 
said RelNScrEv_library
hello 
and 
asked RelNScrEv_library
for 
my 
library 
card 
. 
i 
handed ScrEv_show_card
that 
to 
her 
, 
and 
she 
took RelNScrEv_library
the 
cards 
out 
of 
the 
back 
of 
the 
books 
i 
wanted 
to 
check+out ScrEv_register
. 
she 
made RelNScrEv_library
a 
stamp 
in 
the 
back 
of 
each 
book 
, 
letting RelNScrEv_library
me 
know RelNScrEv_library
what 
day 
the 
books 
were UnrelEv_library
due 
back 
to 
the 
library 
. 
i 
said RelNScrEv_library
thank 
you 
to 
the 
librarian 
, 
and 
she 
handed RelNScrEv_library
me 
back 
my 
library 
card 
and 
the 
books 
. 
i 
could 
n't 
wait UnrelEv_library
to 
get RelNScrEv_library
home 
and 
start UnrelEv_library
reading RelNScrEv_library
. 
<end_of_story>_library 
i 
had 
just 
watched UnrelEv_library
a 
movie 
, 
and 
saw UnrelEv_library
that 
it 
had 
been 
based UnrelEv_library
on 
a 
book 
. 
since 
i 
liked UnrelEv_library
the 
movie 
, 
i 
wanted 
to 
read RelNScrEv_library
the 
book 
and 
went ScrEv_get_library
to 
the 
library 
in 
my 
neighborhood 
to 
see ScrEv_look_for_book
if 
they 
had UnrelEv_library
it 
. 
in 
the 
library 
the 
books 
were 
separated UnrelEv_library
into 
fiction 
and 
non-fiction 
areas 
. 
since 
the 
story 
was UnrelEv_library
about 
something 
that 
happened UnrelEv_library
in 
real 
life 
, 
it 
would 
be UnrelEv_library
in 
the 
non-fiction 
area 
. 
if 
it 
were UnrelEv_library
a 
make-believe 
story 
, 
it 
would 
have 
been UnrelEv_library
in 
the 
fiction 
section 
. 
the 
person 
who 
wrote UnrelEv_library
the 
book 
had UnrelEv_library
a 
last 
name 
that 
began UnrelEv_library
with 
s. 
i 
began UnrelEv_library
looking ScrEv_look_for_book
on 
the 
shelves 
for 
authors 
with 
the 
last 
name 
that 
began UnrelEv_library
with 
s. 
all 
the 
books 
were UnrelEv_library
in 
alphabetical 
order 
according UnrelEv_library
to 
the 
authors 
last 
name 
. 
i 
found RelNScrEv_library
the 
book 
i 
was 
looking ScrEv_look_for_book
for 
and 
took ScrEv_take_book
it 
off 
the 
shelf 
. 
i 
brought ScrEv_go_check_out
it 
to 
the 
desk 
where 
the 
librarian 
was UnrelEv_library
and 
gave RelNScrEv_library
her 
the 
book 
. 
she 
asked RelNScrEv_library
me 
for 
my 
library 
card 
, 
which 
gives UnrelEv_library
me 
permission 
to 
borrow+books Evoking_library
. 
she 
entered RelNScrEv_library
my 
information 
into 
her 
computer 
so 
she 
would 
know UnrelEv_library
who 
borrowed+the+book Evoking_library
. 
she 
told RelNScrEv_library
me 
the 
book 
would 
be UnrelEv_library
due 
back 
in 
the 
library 
in 
two 
weeks 
. 
if 
i 
did 
n't 
bring RelNScrEv_library
it 
back 
by 
then 
, 
i 
would 
have 
to 
pay UnrelEv_library
the 
library 
money 
for 
every 
day 
the 
book 
was UnrelEv_library
late 
. 
i 
did 
n't 
want 
to 
have UnrelEv_library
any 
late 
fees 
, 
so 
i 
made 
sure 
i 
brought RelNScrEv_library
it 
back 
on 
time 
. 
since 
the 
book 
belonged UnrelEv_library
to 
the 
library 
, 
i 
took UnrelEv_library
good 
care 
of 
it 
so 
others 
could 
enjoy UnrelEv_library
the 
book 
when 
they 
borrowed+it Evoking_library
. 
<end_of_story>_library 
the 
library 
called UnrelEv_library
and 
a 
book 
that 
i 
had 
asked UnrelEv_library
to 
be 
notified UnrelEv_library
when 
it 
came+back UnrelEv_library
to 
the 
library 
was UnrelEv_library
back 
in 
. 
i 
drove ScrEv_get_library
to 
the 
library 
that 
is UnrelEv_library
downtown 
. 
i 
went RelNScrEv_library
up 
to 
the 
librarians 
' 
desk 
and 
asked ScrEv_ask_librarian
for 
my 
book 
. 
the 
librarian 
went UnrelEv_library
away 
to 
a 
set 
of 
shelves 
behind 
the 
counter 
and 
returned UnrelEv_library
with 
the 
book 
. 
i 
went UnrelEv_library
and 
sat RelNScrEv_library
on 
a 
chair 
and 
looked RelNScrEv_library
the 
book 
over 
to 
see RelNScrEv_library
if 
it 
was UnrelEv_library
something 
that 
i 
really 
did 
want 
to 
read RelNScrEv_library
. 
the 
book 
looked UnrelEv_library
interesting 
so 
i 
went ScrEv_go_check_out
back 
to 
the 
counter 
and 
waited ScrEv_wait
in 
line 
. 
the 
line 
was UnrelEv_library
long 
today 
. 
i 
found UnrelEv_library
my 
library 
card 
in 
my 
wallet 
and 
waited ScrEv_wait
some 
more 
. 
the 
librarian 
came+over UnrelEv_library
and 
smiled UnrelEv_library
at 
me 
. 
then 
when 
it 
was UnrelEv_library
my 
turn 
at 
the 
counter 
, 
i 
handed RelNScrEv_library
the 
book 
to 
the 
person 
behind 
the 
desk 
. 
she 
scanned ScrEv_register
my 
library 
card 
and 
the 
book 
. 
i 
left ScrEv_leave
the 
library 
with 
book 
in 
hand 
. 
<end_of_story>_library 
i 
was UnrelEv_library
bored 
one 
weekend 
and 
decided UnrelEv_library
i 
would 
like UnrelEv_library
to 
read RelNScrEv_library
a 
new 
book 
. 
i 
checked UnrelEv_library
in 
my 
wallet 
to 
make+sure UnrelEv_library
i 
had UnrelEv_library
my 
library 
card 
. 
seeing UnrelEv_library
that 
i 
did 
in 
fact 
have UnrelEv_library
the 
card 
, 
i 
got UnrelEv_library
in 
my 
car 
and 
drove ScrEv_get_library
to 
the 
nearest 
branch 
of 
the 
public 
library 
, 
about 
four 
miles 
from 
my 
home 
. 
when 
i 
went+in RelNScrEv_library
, 
i 
first 
checked+out ScrEv_browse_releases
the 
new 
arrivals 
, 
both 
fiction 
and 
non-fiction 
. 
then 
i 
looked ScrEv_look_for_book
at 
biographies 
, 
then 
at 
the 
books 
on 
the 
stacks 
for 
favorite 
authors 
. 
i 
finally 
decided RelNScrEv_library
on 
a 
few 
selections 
, 
two 
from 
the 
new 
fiction 
section 
and 
one 
from 
the 
new 
non-fiction 
section 
, 
as 
well 
as 
a 
book 
on 
poetry 
. 
i 
went ScrEv_go_check_out
to 
the 
check-out 
desk 
and 
presented RelNScrEv_library
the 
books 
along 
with 
my 
card 
to 
the 
librarian 
. 
she 
checked ScrEv_register
the 
books 
out 
to 
me 
along 
with 
a 
receipt 
which 
told UnrelEv_library
me 
when 
the 
books 
were UnrelEv_library
due 
back 
.

class 
, 
i 
realized UnrelEv_library
very 
early 
on 
that 
i 
needed 
to 
supplement UnrelEv_library
what 
i 
was 
learning UnrelEv_library
in 
class 
with 
an 
additional 
book 
that 
went UnrelEv_library
over 
some 
of 
the 
basics 
that 
i 
had 
forgotten UnrelEv_library
since 
high 
school 
. 
i 
went ScrEv_get_library
to 
the 
local 
library 
and 
searched ScrEv_look_for_book
through 
many 
of 
the 
ones 
that 
were UnrelEv_library
available 
. 
the 
college 
course 
i 
was 
taking+was UnrelEv_library
very 
important 
and 
i 
wanted 
to 
do UnrelEv_library
well 
in 
it 
. 
after 
523 
hour 
of 
searching ScrEv_look_for_book
i 
found RelNScrEv_library
a 
book 
that 
was 
perfectly 
written UnrelEv_library
for 
people 
that 
wanted UnrelEv_library
a 
refresher 
course 
in 
the 
subject 
of 
geometry 
. 
i 
read RelNScrEv_library
about 
523 
pages 
of 
it 
while 
in 
the 
library 
and 
realized UnrelEv_library
that 
it 
was UnrelEv_library
a 
perfect 
fit 
for 
my 
needs 
. 
i 
walked ScrEv_go_check_out
up 
to 
the 
checkout 
counter 
and 
checked+out ScrEv_register
the 
book 
for 
two 
weeks 
. 
i 
took RelNScrEv_library
the 
book 
home 
and 
read RelNScrEv_library
it 
and 
i 
am UnrelEv_library
very 
glad 
i 
did UnrelEv_library
so 
. 
i 
am UnrelEv_library
glad 
i 
have UnrelEv_library
a 
great 
library 
nearby 
.

needed UnrelEv_library
for 
a

paper

went ScrEv_get_shelf
to 
the

that 
contained UnrelEv_library
the

i 
quicly 
looked RelNScrEv_library

what

check ScrEv_register
it 
out

. 
at

the

asked RelNScrEv_library
for 
my

card 
. 
i 
took RelNScrEv_library
the

<end_of_story>_library 
i 
love UnrelEv_library
reading RelNScrEv_library
books 
, 
and 
once 
i 
finished UnrelEv_library
all 
my 
books 
in 
the 
library 
, 
i 
decided UnrelEv_library
that 
i 
needed UnrelEv_library
new 
books 
. 
the 
best 
place 
in 
my 
neighborhood 
for 
getting ScrEv_take_book
new 
books 
for 
free 
was UnrelEv_library
the 
local 
library 
. 
to 
borrow+from+the+library Evoking_library
, 
all 
you 
needed UnrelEv_library
was 
a 
simple 
library 
card 
. 
i 
walked ScrEv_get_library
to 
the 
local 
library 
and 
went ScrEv_get_shelf
to 
my 
favorite 
section 
of 
the 
library 
. 
the 
history 
section 
had UnrelEv_library
my 
favorite 
books 
about 
napoleon 
. 
once 
i 
found RelNScrEv_library
my 
favorite 
book 
, 
i 
took ScrEv_take_book
it 
with 
me 
and 
brought ScrEv_go_check_out
it 
over 
to 
the 
check 
outline 
. 
i 
waited ScrEv_wait
in 
line 
until 
it 
was UnrelEv_library
my 
turn 
. 
i 
gave ScrEv_other_library
the 
librarian 
my 
book 
and 
library 
card 
and 
they 
checked ScrEv_register
it 
out 
for 
me 
. 
i 
was 
given ScrEv_get_receipt
a 
receipt 
and 
a 
date 
to 
return RelNScrEv_library
the 
book 
. 
i 
had UnrelEv_library
three 
weeks 
to 
finish UnrelEv_library
the 
book 
before 
i 
had 
to 
go UnrelEv_library
back 
and 
return RelNScrEv_library
it 
. 
when 
i 
left ScrEv_leave
the 
library 
, 
the 
security 
checked RelNScrEv_library
my 
receipt 
and 
my 
books 
and 
allowed UnrelEv_library
me 
to 
leave ScrEv_leave
. 
<end_of_story>_library 
the 
library 
has UnrelEv_library
so 
many 
books 
to 
choose ScrEv_take_book
from 
, 
it 
's UnrelEv_library
hard 
to 
decide UnrelEv_library
which 
one 
to 
borrow Evoking_library
. 
looking+around RelNScrEv_library
at 
all 
the 
shelves 
of 
books 
, 
i 
decided UnrelEv_library
i 
wanted UnrelEv_library
an 
adventure 
book 
. 
the 
librarian 
was UnrelEv_library
nice 
enough 
to 
help UnrelEv_library
me 
look ScrEv_look_for_book
for 
a 
good 
book 
to 
borrow Evoking_library
. 
i 
decided UnrelEv_library
on 
a 
pirate 
adventure 
book 
. 
but 
before 
i 
could 
borrow Evoking_library
it 
, 
i 
had 
to 
get RelNScrEv_library
a 
library 
card 
. 
again 
, 
the 
librarian 
was UnrelEv_library
very 
helpful 
. 
we 
walked ScrEv_go_check_out
over 
to 
the 
counter 
, 
and 
she 
helped UnrelEv_library
me 
sign+up RelNScrEv_library
for 
a 
library 
card 
. 
all 
i 
had 
to 
do UnrelEv_library
was 
tell RelNScrEv_library
her 
a 
few 
things 
like 
my 
name 
and 
my 
address 
, 
and 
i 
had UnrelEv_library
my 
very 
own 
library 
card 
. 
once 
i 
had UnrelEv_library
that 
, 
it 
was UnrelEv_library
easy 
to 
check+out ScrEv_register
the 
book 
. 
she 
scanned RelNScrEv_library
my 
library 
card 
, 
punched RelNScrEv_library
some 
buttons 
on 
her 
computer 
, 
and 
the 
book 
was UnrelEv_library
mine 
to 
borrow Evoking_library
. 
i 
'll 
be UnrelEv_library
sure 
to 
bring RelNScrEv_library
it 
back 
in 
a 
few 
days 
so 
i 
do 
n't 
have 
to 
pay RelNScrEv_library
any 
late 
fees 
. 
<end_of_story>_library 
sometimes 
i 
buy UnrelEv_library
books 
but 
more 
often 
i 
just 
decide UnrelEv_library
to 
borrow+one+from+the+public+library Evoking_library
because 
you 
can 
read RelNScrEv_library
them 
and 
take RelNScrEv_library
them 
back 
and 
it 
does 
n't 
cost UnrelEv_library
you 
anything 
. 
most 
libraries 
have UnrelEv_library
a 
vast 
selection 
of 
books 
so 
you 
would 
never 
be UnrelEv_library
unable 
to 
find RelNScrEv_library
something 
you 
wanted 
to 
read RelNScrEv_library
. 
a 
lot 
of 
libraries 
have UnrelEv_library
their 
catalog 
online 
so 
you 
can 
check ScrEv_check_catalog
to 
see 
if 
they 
have UnrelEv_library
a 
particular 
book 
before 
you 
go ScrEv_get_library
to 
the 
library 
. 
i 
recently 
had 
to 
join RelNScrEv_library
a 
new 
library 
so 
i 
went ScrEv_get_library
there 
and 
spoke ScrEv_ask_librarian
to 
the 
lady 
behind 
the 
desk 
who 
asked UnrelEv_library
me 
to 
fill+in RelNScrEv_library
a 
form 
with 
my 
address 
and 
contact 
details 
, 
and 
provide RelNScrEv_library
proof 
of 
my 
identity 
. 
when 
i 
had 
finished UnrelEv_library
filling+in RelNScrEv_library
the 
form 
, 
i 
took UnrelEv_library
it 
back 
to 
her 
and 
she 
made RelNScrEv_library
me 
a 
little 
plastic 
library 
card 
with 
my 
account 
number 
and 
my 
name 
on 
it 
, 
along 
with 
a 
unique 
barcode 
. 
she 
told UnrelEv_library
me 
i 
had 
to 
use UnrelEv_library
this 
card 
to 
check+out ScrEv_register
books 
whenever 
i 
went ScrEv_get_library
to 
the 
library 
. 
there 
were UnrelEv_library
thousands 
of 
books 
on 
hundreds 
of 
shelves 
, 
all 
of 
them 
are 
filed UnrelEv_library
in 
some 
sort 
of 
order 
. 
fiction 
books 
were 
filed UnrelEv_library
by 
author 
surname 
, 
and 
non-fiction 
books 
were 
filed UnrelEv_library
by 
a 
system 
called 
the 
dewey 
decimal 
system 
which 
numbers UnrelEv_library
books 
according 
to 
their 
subject 
classification 
and 
are 
then 
filed UnrelEv_library
in 
that 
number 
order 
. 
the 
books 
were UnrelEv_library
easy 
to 
find RelNScrEv_library
, 
there 
were UnrelEv_library
computers 
around 
the 
library 
where 
you 
could 
check ScrEv_use_computer
to 
see ScrEv_look_for_book
what 
books 
were UnrelEv_library
available 
. 
when 
i 
had 
selected ScrEv_take_book
the 
books 
i 
wanted 
to 
borrow Evoking_library
i 
went ScrEv_go_check_out
to 
one 
of 
the 
self 
service 
stations 
and 
scanned ScrEv_register
the 
barcode 
on 
the 
books 
and 
the 
barcode 
on 
my 
new 
library 
card 
, 
and 
the 
books 
were 
issued ScrEv_register
to 
me 
. 
i 
also 
got ScrEv_get_receipt
a 
printed UnrelEv_library
receipt 
to 
show 
me 
when 
the 
books 
were UnrelEv_library
due 
to 
be 
returned RelNScrEv_library
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_library
very 
easy 
to 
do UnrelEv_library
. 
<end_of_story>_library 
i 
was 
sitting UnrelEv_library
at 
home 
thinking UnrelEv_library
about 
a 
particular 
book 
that 
i 
had 
been 
wanting 
to 
read RelNScrEv_library
so 
i 
decided UnrelEv_library
to 
get UnrelEv_library
in 
my 
car 
and 
drive ScrEv_get_library
to 
the 
library 
. 
after 
i 
parked UnrelEv_library
my 
car 
in 
the 
parking 
lot 
i 
got UnrelEv_library
out 
of 
my 
car 
and 
entered RelNScrEv_library
the 
library 
. 
once 
inside 
the 
library 
i 
went RelNScrEv_library
up 
the 
stairs 
of 
the 
library 
to 
the 
second 
floor 
. 
once 
i 
got UnrelEv_library
to 
the 
second 
floor 
i 
browsed RelNScrEv_library
around 
the 
aisles 
until 
i 
found RelNScrEv_library
the 
book 
that 
i 
was 
looking ScrEv_look_for_book
for 
. 
once 
i 
got ScrEv_take_book
the 
book 
i 
went RelNScrEv_library
back 
down 
the 
stairs 
i 
went ScrEv_go_check_out
to 
the 
check-out 
counter 
and 
gave ScrEv_show_card
the 
librarian 
my 
library 
card 
. 
i 
told RelNScrEv_library
the 
librarian 
thank 
you 
after 
she 
checked+out ScrEv_register
my 
book 
. 
she 
handed ScrEv_get_receipt
me 
the 
book 
and 
a 
receipt 
and 
told RelNScrEv_library
me 
you 
're 
welcome 
. 
i 
left ScrEv_leave
the 
library 
and 
got UnrelEv_library
into 
my 
car 
and 
drove ScrEv_leave
home 
were 
i 
began UnrelEv_library
reading RelNScrEv_library
the 
book 
i 
'd 
been 
wanting UnrelEv_library
to 
read RelNScrEv_library
. 
<end_of_story>_library 
the 
last 
time 
i 
wanted 
to 
borrow+a+book+from+the+library Evoking_library
i 
was UnrelEv_library
in 
a 
different 
town 
than 
my 
home 
town 
. 
i 
talked ScrEv_ask_librarian
to 
the 
librarian 
about 
this 
and 
he 
told RelNScrEv_library
me 
that 
it 
was UnrelEv_library
possible 
for 
me 
to 
obtain RelNScrEv_library
a 
guest 
pass 
, 
though 
this 
would 
only 
allow UnrelEv_library
me 
to 
take+out ScrEv_take_book
two 
books 
at 
a 
time 
. 
since 
this 
was UnrelEv_library
my 
only 
option 
i 
decided UnrelEv_library
i 
would 
take UnrelEv_library
it 
. 
i 
filled+out RelNScrEv_library
the 
form 
, 
providing RelNScrEv_library
my 
name 
and 
address 
, 
and 
showed RelNScrEv_library
him 
my 
identification 
card 
, 
and 
i 
was 
given RelNScrEv_library
a 
library 
card 
. 
i 
used UnrelEv_library
the 
card 
to 
pick+up ScrEv_take_book
two 
books 
: 
a 
collection 
of 
poetry 
and 
the 
book 
hylozoic 
by 
rudy 
rucker 
. 
the 
librarian 
told RelNScrEv_library
me 
that 
i 
had 
to 
return RelNScrEv_library
the 
books 
within 
the 
space 
of 
three 
weeks 
, 
so 
as 
soon 
as 
i 
returned ScrEv_leave
to 
my 
house 
i 
began UnrelEv_library
to 
read RelNScrEv_library
them 
immediately 
. 
after 
i 
was UnrelEv_library
done 
with 
the 
books 
i 
returned RelNScrEv_library
them 
to 
the 
library 
. 
<end_of_story>_library 
i 
went+to+the+library Evoking_library
and 
walked+in ScrEv_get_library
the 
door 
. 
i 
was 
interested UnrelEv_library
in 
borrowing+a+book Evoking_library
about 
the 
american 
revolutionary 
war 
. 
the 
book 
was 
written RelNScrEv_library
by 
a 
man 
named UnrelEv_library
john 
canton 
. 
inside 
the 
library 
there 
is UnrelEv_library
a 
bank 
of 
computers 
. 
i 
went RelNScrEv_library
to 
one 
of 
the

and 
typed+in ScrEv_use_computer
the 
author 
's 
last

there 
were UnrelEv_library
a 
number 
of 
books 
by 
people 
with 
the

canton 
, 
but 
i 
quickly 
found ScrEv_use_computer
the 
one 
i 
was 
looking+for ScrEv_look_for_book
. 
the 
computer 
told ScrEv_use_computer
me 
the 
book 
's 
call 
number 
. 
i 
wrote ScrEv_note_shelf
it 
down 
on 
an 
index 
card 
i 
had UnrelEv_library
with 
me 
. 
the 
library 
has UnrelEv_library
three

i 
looked RelNScrEv_library
at 
a

me 
that

to 
the 
book 
stacks 
, 
the 
lines 
of 
shelving 
where 
they 
keep RelNScrEv_library
the 
books 
. 
i 
walked ScrEv_get_shelf
along 
the 
shelving 
, 
looking RelNScrEv_library
at 
the 
labels 
on 
the 
side 
of 
the 
shelves 
that 
said UnrelEv_library
what 
call 
numbers 
were UnrelEv_library
in 
the 
aisles 
i 
was 
passing RelNScrEv_library
. 
finally 
i 
found ScrEv_get_shelf
the 
right 
shelf 
, 
and 
soon 
, 
again 
by 
looking ScrEv_look_for_book
at 
the 
call 
numbers 
on 
the 
books 
on 
those 
shelves 
, 
i 
found ScrEv_take_book
the 
book 
i 
was 
interested RelNScrEv_library
in 
. 
i 
brought ScrEv_go_check_out
the 
book 
to 
the 
circulation 
desk 
and 
gave ScrEv_show_card
the 
woman 
working RelNScrEv_library
there 
my 
library 
card 
. 
she 
scanned ScrEv_register
the 
book 
and 
my 
card 
and 
handed RelNScrEv_library
both 
back 
to 
me 
. 
she 
told RelNScrEv_library
me 
my 
book 
is+due ScrEv_return_book
in 
two 
weeks 
. 
<end_of_story>_library 
for 
a 
school 
assignment 
i 
needed 
to 
find+a+book+from+the+library Evoking_library
. 
i 
went ScrEv_get_library
to 
the 
library 
after 
class 
and 
looked ScrEv_use_computer
the 
book 
up 
on 
the 
computer 
which 
had UnrelEv_library
the 
library 
's 
catalogue 
. 
the 
book 
was UnrelEv_library
upstairs 
, 
so 
i 
went ScrEv_get_shelf
there 
and 
followed ScrEv_get_shelf
the 
call 
numbers 
until 
i 
found ScrEv_take_book
what 
i 
was 
looking+for ScrEv_look_for_book
. 
i 
then 
went ScrEv_go_check_out
back 
downstairs 
to 
the 
circulation 
desk 
. 
i 
placed ScrEv_register
the 
book 
on 
the 
counter 
and 
the 
friendly 
librarian 
swiped ScrEv_show_card
my 
library 
card 
and 
then 
scanned ScrEv_register
the 
book 
. 
turns+out UnrelEv_library
i 
owed RelNScrEv_library
a 
fine 
which 
i 
had 
to 
pay RelNScrEv_library
before 
i 
could 
have RelNScrEv_library
the 
book 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_library
only 
a 
dime 
which 
thankfully 
i 
had UnrelEv_library
on 
my 
person 
. 
after 
paying RelNScrEv_library
the 
fine 
the 
book 
was 
stamped ScrEv_get_receipt
with 
a 
due 
date 
and 
the 
librarian 
gave RelNScrEv_library
it 
to 
me 
. 
it 
was 
raining UnrelEv_library
out 
so 
she 
gave RelNScrEv_library
me 
a 
rain 
bag 
to 
protect ScrEv_other_library
the 
book 
. 
i 
was ScrEv_leave
on 
my 
way 
. 
<end_of_story>_library 
in 
need 
of 
a 
new 
series 
to 
sink UnrelEv_library
my 
teeth 
into 
, 
i 
decided UnrelEv_library
to 
head+to+the+public+library Evoking_library
. 
i 
ca 
n't 
seem UnrelEv_library
to 
go UnrelEv_library
long 
without 
reading RelNScrEv_library
some 
mythical 
, 
crazy 
fantasy 
! 
anyway 
, 
when 
i 
got ScrEv_get_library
to 
the 
library 
, 
i 
sat+down RelNScrEv_library
at 
their 
computer 
where 
you 
can 
look+up ScrEv_use_computer
where 
certain 
books 
are UnrelEv_library
in 
the 
library 
. 
i 
found ScrEv_use_computer
where 
the 
fantasy 
section 
was UnrelEv_library
and 
headed+over ScrEv_get_shelf
to 
that 
shelf 
. 
oh 
my 
goodness 
, 
there 
were UnrelEv_library
more 
books 
than 
i 
could 
ever 
imagine UnrelEv_library
! 
i 
was 
practically 
drooling UnrelEv_library
! 
i 
saw ScrEv_look_for_book
the 
series 
i 
was 
looking+for ScrEv_look_for_book
and 
decided UnrelEv_library
to 
get ScrEv_take_book
just 
the 
first 
book 
in 
the 
series 
-lrb- 
so 
i 
do 
n't 
binge+read RelNScrEv_library
-rrb- 
. 
i 
took ScrEv_take_book
the 
book 
up 
to 
the 
front 
counter 
and 
handed ScrEv_show_card
the 
librarian 
my 
member 
card 
so 
that 
i 
could 
check ScrEv_register
the 
book 
out 
. 
she 
looked RelNScrEv_library
the 
book 
over 
and 
commented RelNScrEv_library
that 
it 
was UnrelEv_library
one 
of 
her 
favorites 
which 
made UnrelEv_library
me 
smile RelNScrEv_library
. 
with 
the 
book 
now 
checked+out ScrEv_register
, 
i 
slipped ScrEv_other_library
it 
into 
my 
page 
and 
made ScrEv_leave
my 
way 
home 
. 
i 
was UnrelEv_library
ready 
to 
dive UnrelEv_library
into 
a 
new 
adventure 
! 
<end_of_story>_library 
my 
five 
year 
old 
son 
loves UnrelEv_library
to 
read RelNScrEv_library
books 
, 
so 
today 
we 
both 
decided UnrelEv_library
to 
head ScrEv_get_library
towards 
the 
library 
to 
pick+one+out Evoking_library
. 
before 
leaving UnrelEv_library
the 
house 
i 
made+sure UnrelEv_library
he 
had UnrelEv_library
his 
library 
card 
with 
him 
because 
without 
it 
he 
would 
n't 
be UnrelEv_library
able 
to 
borrow+a+book Evoking_library
. 
when 
we 
entered ScrEv_get_library
the 
library 
we 
went ScrEv_get_shelf
straight 
towards 
the 
kid 
section 
. 
there 
were UnrelEv_library
thousands 
of 
books 
to 
choose ScrEv_look_for_book
from 
and 
he 
had UnrelEv_library
a 
little 
trouble 
making+up RelNScrEv_library
his 
mind 
. 
finally 
we 
found ScrEv_take_book
a 
book 
about 
the 
different 
type 
of 
sea 
animals 
in 
the 
ocean 
. 
he 
was UnrelEv_library
very 
excited 
as 
he 
flipped RelNScrEv_library
through 
the 
pages 
of 
the 
book 
. 
when 
he 
decided UnrelEv_library
this 
was UnrelEv_library
the 
book 
he 
wanted UnrelEv_library
to 
take ScrEv_take_book
home 
, 
we 
make ScrEv_go_check_out
our 
way 
towards 
the 
librarian 
. 
she 
greeted RelNScrEv_library
us 
with 
a 
friendly 
hello 
and 
asked ScrEv_show_card
my 
son 
for 
his 
library 
card 
. 
she 
scanned ScrEv_register
the 
card 
and 
book 
then 
handed RelNScrEv_library
them 
both 
back 
to 
my 
son 
. 
she 
informed RelNScrEv_library
us 
when 
the 
book 
was+due ScrEv_return_book
back 
and 
we 
both 
thanked RelNScrEv_library
her 
and 
wished RelNScrEv_library
her 
a 
pleasant 
day 
. 
<end_of_story>_library 
borrowing+a+book+from+the+library Evoking_library
is UnrelEv_library
quite 
a 
fun 
task 
. 
make+sure UnrelEv_library
you 
have ScrEv_obtain_card
a 
library 
card 
first 
. 
if 
not 
, 
you 
can

how 
to 
sign+up ScrEv_obtain_card
for 
one 
. 
library 
cards 
are UnrelEv_library
usually

search 
will 
tell ScrEv_use_computer
you 
where 
exactly 
in 
the 
library 
the 
book 
is 
located RelNScrEv_library

or 
it 
might

you 
the 
book 
is UnrelEv_library
not 
at

and 
that 
you 
'll

<end_of_story>_library 
i 
went+to+the+local+library Evoking_library
in 
my 
town 
yesterday 
. 
i 
was 
dying UnrelEv_library
to 
read RelNScrEv_library
the 
new 
book 
by 
james 
patterson 
. 
i 
love UnrelEv_library
mysteries 
! 
i 
was UnrelEv_library
n't 
sure 
where 
to 
find ScrEv_get_shelf
the 
mystery 
section 
in 
the 
library 
so 
i 
asked ScrEv_ask_librarian
the 
librarian 
. 
she 
entered ScrEv_use_computer
the 
book 
information 
into 
the 
computer 
and 
then 
told ScrEv_ask_librarian
me 
where 
i 
could 
find ScrEv_look_for_book
the 
book 
. 
as 
it 
turned+out UnrelEv_library
, 
the 
mystery 
section 
was 
clearly 
labeled RelNScrEv_library
, 
as 
were UnrelEv_library
the 
books 
. 
they 
were UnrelEv_library
in 
alphabetical 
order 
by 
author 
. 
i 
found ScrEv_get_shelf
the 
p 
section 
and 
located ScrEv_look_for_book
books 
by 
patterson 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_library
easy 
to 
find ScrEv_take_book
my 
book 
. 
i 
took ScrEv_go_check_out
the 
book 
up 
to 
the 
checkout 
desk 
. 
the 
librarian 
asked ScrEv_show_card
for 
my 
library 
card 
. 
a 
library 
card 
has UnrelEv_library
my 
name 
on 
it 
and 
a 
computer 
code 
on 
it 
. 
the 
librarian 
swiped ScrEv_register
my 
card 
and 
told RelNScrEv_library
me 
that 
my 
book 
was+due ScrEv_return_book
back 
in 
two 
weeks 
. 
i 
thanked RelNScrEv_library
her 
for 
helping RelNScrEv_library
me 
. 
she 
told RelNScrEv_library
me 
that 
she 
hoped UnrelEv_library
i 
enjoyed RelNScrEv_library
the 
book 
. 
<end_of_story>_library 
i 
made+sure UnrelEv_library
i 
had UnrelEv_library
my 
library 
card 
with 
me 
before 
i 
went+to+the+library Evoking_library
. 
then 
, 
i 
looked ScrEv_use_computer
on 
the 
computers 
for 
a 
book 
i 
liked RelNScrEv_library
. 
i 
was UnrelEv_library
n't 
able 
to 
find ScrEv_use_computer
one 
that 
well 
, 
so 
i 
asked ScrEv_ask_librarian
a 
librarian 
for 
advice 
. 
she 
also 
looked ScrEv_check_catalog
in 
the 
catalog 
and 
asked ScrEv_ask_librarian
me 
about 
what 
i 
wanted RelNScrEv_library
so 
she 
could 
suggest ScrEv_ask_librarian
more 
options 
. 
finally 
, 
i 
found ScrEv_check_catalog
a 
book 
i 
liked RelNScrEv_library
. 
i 
told ScrEv_ask_librarian
the 
librarian 
i 
wanted RelNScrEv_library
that 
one 
, 
and 
she 
wrote+down ScrEv_note_shelf
the 
title 
, 
author 
, 
and 
dewey 
decimal 
number 
. 
we 
went+along ScrEv_get_shelf
the 
bookshelves 
until 
we 
found ScrEv_get_shelf
the 
correct 
number 
range 
, 
then 
started UnrelEv_library
searching ScrEv_look_for_book
the 
shelves 
by 
the 
author 
's 
last 
name 
. 
i 
found ScrEv_take_book
the 
book 
and 
took ScrEv_go_check_out
it 
to 
the 
counter 
. 
the 
librarian 
scanned ScrEv_register
the 
book 
and 
my 
card 
and 
said UnrelEv_library
i 
would 
have 
to 
return ScrEv_return_book
it 
in 
523 
weeks 
. 
she 
gave ScrEv_get_receipt
me 
a 
receipt 
. 
i 
thanked RelNScrEv_library
her 
and 
noted RelNScrEv_library
the 
due 
date 
down 
on 
my 
calendar 
. 
<end_of_story>_library 
in 
order 
to 
borrow+a+book+from+the+library Evoking_library
, 
i 
will 
check UnrelEv_library
to 
be+sure UnrelEv_library
i 
have UnrelEv_library
my 
library 
card 
on 
me 
, 
in 
my 
purse 
. 
i 
drive ScrEv_get_library
to 
the 
local 
library 
and 
park RelNScrEv_library
my 
car 
. 
i 
walk ScrEv_get_library
into 
the 
library 
and 
head ScrEv_get_shelf
to 
where 
the 
books 
to 
check+out ScrEv_register
are 
located RelNScrEv_library
. 
i 
head ScrEv_get_shelf
over 
there 
and 
start UnrelEv_library
to 
look+for ScrEv_look_for_book
the 
book 
i 
am 
interested UnrelEv_library
in 
borrowing Evoking_library
. 
if 
i 
am 
having UnrelEv_library
a 
problem 
finding ScrEv_look_for_book
the 
book 
, 
i 
will 
go RelNScrEv_library
to 
the 
information 
desk 
and 
ask ScrEv_ask_librarian
for 
help 
. 
sometimes 
, 
it 
is UnrelEv_library
hard 
to 
find ScrEv_look_for_book
for 
me 
to 
find ScrEv_look_for_book
a 
book 
on 
my 
own 
in 
the 
library 
, 
since 
they 
have UnrelEv_library
a 
coding 
system 
that 
is 
sometimes 
confusing UnrelEv_library
to 
me 
. 
i 
either 
find RelNScrEv_library
my 
book 
available 
, 
or 
find UnrelEv_library
that 
it 
is 
checked+out ScrEv_register
. 
if 
it 
is UnrelEv_library
available 
, 
i 
get RelNScrEv_library
my 
library 
card 
out 
and 
head ScrEv_go_check_out
to 
the 
check 
out 
section 
of 
the 
library 
. 
if 
it 
is UnrelEv_library
n't 
available 
, 
i 
will 
ask ScrEv_ask_librarian
as 
to 
when 
it 
will 
be UnrelEv_library
. 
i 
leave ScrEv_leave
the 
library 
, 
get RelNScrEv_library
in 
my 
car 
and 
drive RelNScrEv_library
home 
to 
enjoy RelNScrEv_library
my 
borrowed Evoking_library
book 
. 
<end_of_story>_library 
i 
waited UnrelEv_library
too 
long 
to 
start+working UnrelEv_library
on 
my 
report 
that 
was UnrelEv_library
due 
for 
my 
class 
. 
i 
was UnrelEv_library
in 
a 
hurry 
, 
and 
had UnrelEv_library
to 
get+some+research+material Evoking_library
for 
the 
assignment 
. 
sadly 
, 
one 
of 
the 
requirements 
for 
this 
report 
was UnrelEv_library
to 
have UnrelEv_library
a 
couple 
citations 
from 
a 
book 
instead 
of 
other 
articles 
that 
can UnrelEv_library
easily 
be 
found UnrelEv_library
on 
the 
internet 
. 
after 
an 
hour 
of 
searching RelNScrEv_library
for 
my 
library 
card 
, 
i 
found RelNScrEv_library
it 
at 
last 
and 
head+out RelNScrEv_library
. 
after 
i 
arrived ScrEv_get_library
i 
had 
to 
ask ScrEv_ask_librarian
the 
librarian 
where 
they 
kept RelNScrEv_library
such 
books 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_library
a 
while 
since 
i 
have 
been Unclear_library
in 
there 
. 
after 
finding ScrEv_get_shelf
the 
section 
. 
i 
carefully 
looked ScrEv_look_for_book
through 
the 
books 
that 
caught UnrelEv_library
my 
eye 
and 
picked ScrEv_take_book
the 
book 
that 
i 
needed RelNScrEv_library
for 
my 
report 
. 
i 
walked+up ScrEv_go_check_out
to 
the 
librarian 
, 
and 
borrowed ScrEv_register
the 
book 
. 
but 
not 
without 
paying RelNScrEv_library
an 
old 
book 
fee 
i 
had UnrelEv_library
from 
a 
year 
ago 
. 
after 
i 
paid RelNScrEv_library
, 
i 
walked+out ScrEv_leave
with 
the 
book 
in 
hand 
ready 
to 
do RelNScrEv_library
some 
research 
. 
<end_of_story>_library 
i 
used UnrelEv_library
to 
go+to+the+library Evoking_library
all 
the 
time 
. 
i 
am UnrelEv_library
a 
complete 
bookworm 
, 
and 
since 
i 
do 
n't 
have UnrelEv_library
the 
time 
to 
read RelNScrEv_library
completely 
through 
a 
523 
page 
novel 
anymore 
, 
i 
do 
n't 
borrow+books Evoking_library
very 
often 
anymore 
. 
i 
loved UnrelEv_library
to 
go UnrelEv_library
look RelNScrEv_library
through 
all 
the 
fiction 
books 
. 
the 
science 
fiction 
and 
fantasy 
novels 
always 
caught RelNScrEv_library
my 
eye 
. 
i 
am UnrelEv_library
just 
in 
love 
with 
the 
creative 
imagination 
involved UnrelEv_library
with 
writing+out UnrelEv_library
such 
beautiful 
worlds 
and 
bringing UnrelEv_library
me 
into 
them 
to 
see UnrelEv_library
what 
they 
see UnrelEv_library
. 
so 
after 
i 
had 
chosen ScrEv_take_book
my 
book 
, 
i 
would 
go ScrEv_go_check_out
up 
to 
the 
desk 
. 
when 
i 
was 
checking ScrEv_register
them 
out 
, 
you 
had 
to 
bring RelNScrEv_library
your 
library 
card 
so 
they 
could 
scan ScrEv_show_card
it 
. 
they 
would 
then 
scan ScrEv_show_card
the 
card 
, 
scan ScrEv_register
each 
book 
, 
and 
give ScrEv_get_receipt
you 
a 
card 
with 
a 
stamped UnrelEv_library
due 
date 
on 
it 
. 
you 
could 
bring ScrEv_return_book
it 
back 
before 
that 
time 
, 
or 
, 
if 
the 
book 
was UnrelEv_library
n't 
insanely 
popular 
and 
had UnrelEv_library
no 
one 
waiting ScrEv_wait
on 
it 
, 
you 
could 
recheck ScrEv_register
it 
out 
if 
you 
needed UnrelEv_library
more 
time 
to 
read RelNScrEv_library
. 
<end_of_story>_library 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_library
something 
interesting 
to 
read RelNScrEv_library
as 
i 
have UnrelEv_library
several 
days 
with 
no 
plans 
starting UnrelEv_library
this 
weekend 
. 
i 
enjoy RelNScrEv_library
various 
types 
of 
books 
but 
wanted UnrelEv_library
something 
really 
different 
so 
i 
decided UnrelEv_library
to 
go Unclear_library
with 
a 
good 
science 
fiction 
and 
something 
that 
was 
rated UnrelEv_library
well 
by 
reviewers 
. 
i 
found ScrEv_check_catalog
what 
i 
wanted RelNScrEv_library
online 
and 
drove ScrEv_get_library
to 
the 
library 
. 
i 
asked ScrEv_ask_librarian
the 
librarian 
where 
the 
sci 
fi 
section 
was UnrelEv_library
and 
showed RelNScrEv_library
me 
. 
before 
looking ScrEv_look_for_book
for 
the 
one 
i 
wanted RelNScrEv_library
i 
browsed ScrEv_browse_releases
the 
books 
and 
saw RelNScrEv_library
several 
that 
looked RelNScrEv_library
interesting 
. 
i 
opened RelNScrEv_library
one 
in 
particular 
and 
starting UnrelEv_library
going+through RelNScrEv_library
it 
. 
i 
decided UnrelEv_library
to 
select ScrEv_take_book
this 
book 
. 
i 
then 
looked+for ScrEv_look_for_book
the 
book 
i 
came UnrelEv_library
to 
borrow Evoking_library
and 
eventually 
found ScrEv_take_book
it 
. 
remarkably 
it 
had UnrelEv_library
the 
same 
author 
as 
the 
previous 
book 
i 
had 
selected ScrEv_take_book
. 
i 
must 
have UnrelEv_library
great 
taste 
in 
books 
. 
i 
brought ScrEv_go_check_out
both 
books 
to 
the 
front 
desk 
and 
checked ScrEv_register
them 
out 
. 
i 
was UnrelEv_library
very 
pleased 
with 
the 
library 
and 
quite 
happy 
to 
have UnrelEv_library
more 
than 
one 
book 
to 
look+forward UnrelEv_library
to 
reading RelNScrEv_library
. 
<end_of_story>_library 
i 
am UnrelEv_library
an 
avid 
reader 
so 
i 
am UnrelEv_library
always 
on 
the 
lookout 
for 
the 
next 
best 
story 
of 
nonfiction 
! 
my 
buddy 
, 
frank 
, 
told UnrelEv_library
me 
about 
the 
new 
library 
that 
was 
opening+up UnrelEv_library
about 
a 
mile 
away 
from 
my 
house 
and 
i 
thought UnrelEv_library
this 
was UnrelEv_library
a 
great 
opportunity 
to 
be UnrelEv_library
able 
to 
borrow+some+free+books Evoking_library
! 
i 
drove+down ScrEv_get_library
and 
was UnrelEv_library
in 
awe 
at 
how 
big 
the 
place 
was UnrelEv_library
. 
as 
i 
stepped ScrEv_get_library
inside 
and 
began UnrelEv_library
to 
browse ScrEv_browse_releases
i 
realized UnrelEv_library
that 
not 
only 
did 
they 
have RelNScrEv_library
books 
but 
they 
had RelNScrEv_library
video 
games 
, 
dvds 
, 
and 
music 
you 
could 
rent Unclear_library
as 
well 
. 
after 
spending UnrelEv_library
about 
half 
an 
hour 
in 
there 
just 
browsing ScrEv_browse_releases
i 
finally 
came+upon ScrEv_look_for_book
a 
book 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_library
to 
read RelNScrEv_library
: 
the 
hitchhikers 
guide 
to 
the 
galaxy 
! 
i 
grabbed ScrEv_take_book
the 
book 
and 
went+up ScrEv_go_check_out
to 
the 
counter 
. 
the 
nice 
librarian 
said UnrelEv_library
that 
i 
would 
first 
have 
to 
get ScrEv_obtain_card
a 
library 
card 
so 
i 
could 
rent+out ScrEv_register
my 
book 
. 
i 
filled+out RelNScrEv_library
the 
paper 
work 
and 
she 
handed RelNScrEv_library
me 
a 
shinny 
new 
library 
card 
! 
i 
rented ScrEv_register
my 
book 
and 
she 
told RelNScrEv_library
me 
that 
i 
was+due ScrEv_return_book
by 
a 
week 
from 
today 
. 
i 
went ScrEv_leave
back 
home 
and 
got+started UnrelEv_library
on 
my 
reading 
adventure 
. 
<end_of_story>_library 
i 
went+to+the+library Evoking_library
in 
town 
the 
other 
day 
because 
i 
really 
want UnrelEv_library
to 
read RelNScrEv_library
this 
book 
that 
my 
friend 
told UnrelEv_library
me 
about 
. 
after 
driving ScrEv_get_library
to 
the 
library 
, 
i 
went RelNScrEv_library
to 
the 
main 
desk 
to 
inquire ScrEv_ask_librarian
about 
the 
book 
. 
the 
librarian 
kindly 
greeted RelNScrEv_library
me 
and 
searched ScrEv_use_computer
for 
the 
book 
on 
her 
card 
catalog 
computer 
system 
. 
she 
saw ScrEv_use_computer
that 
there 
were UnrelEv_library
523 
copies 
available 
in 
the 
new 
books 
section 
. 
she 
and 
i 
walked ScrEv_get_shelf
upstairs 
to 
the 
new 
books 
area 
and 
we 
were UnrelEv_library
able 
to 
find ScrEv_look_for_book
the 
book 
. 
i 
thanked RelNScrEv_library
her 
for 
help 
. 
then 
i 
walked ScrEv_go_check_out
back 
downstairs 
to 
check ScrEv_register
the 
book 
out 
. 
the 
check 
out 
lines 
were RelNScrEv_library
all 
full 
but 
there 
were RelNScrEv_library
a 
couple 
self-checkout 
machines 
available 
. 
after 
checking+out ScrEv_register
the 
book 
, 
i 
went ScrEv_leave
home 
and 
read RelNScrEv_library
it 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_library
very 
good 
and 
i 
finished RelNScrEv_library
it 
in 
523 
days 
. 
the 
next 
day 
, 
i 
returned ScrEv_return_book
the 
book 
to 
the 
library 
for 
the 
next 
eager 
patron 
to 
enjoy RelNScrEv_library
. 
<end_of_story>_library 
using+a+school+or+public+library Evoking_library
is UnrelEv_library
a 
great 
thing 
to 
do UnrelEv_library
. 
while 
i 
'm UnrelEv_library
at 
the 
library 
, 
i 
like UnrelEv_library
to 
peruse RelNScrEv_library
the 
shelves 
and 
see ScrEv_look_for_book
if 
there 
is UnrelEv_library
anything 
that 
catches RelNScrEv_library
my 
attention 
. 
if 
i 
do 
n't 
see UnrelEv_library
anything 
i 
like RelNScrEv_library
, 
i 
can 
use ScrEv_check_catalog
the 
online 
catalog 
to 
find ScrEv_look_for_book
something 
that 
i 
either 
need RelNScrEv_library
or 
want RelNScrEv_library
. 
it 
's UnrelEv_library
simple 
to 
find ScrEv_look_for_book
books 
on

if 
i 
write+down ScrEv_note_shelf
the 
call 
number 
and 
follow ScrEv_get_shelf
the 
signs 
directing RelNScrEv_library
to 
that 
area 
. 
once 
my 
book 
is ScrEv_take_book
in 
hand 
, 
i 
prepare UnrelEv_library
by 
getting+out RelNScrEv_library
my 
library 
card 
and 
heading ScrEv_go_check_out
toward 
the 
circulation 
desk 
. 
some 
libraries 
now 
have RelNScrEv_library
self-service 
checkout 
areas 
, 
while 
others 
still 
require UnrelEv_library
you 
working RelNScrEv_library
with 
a 
clerk 
or 
librarian 
to 
check+out ScrEv_register
. 
at 
the 
self 
service 
kiosk 
, 
i 
scan ScrEv_show_card
my 
library 
card 
and 
then 
scan ScrEv_register
the 
barcode 
on 
my 
book 
. 
it 
's UnrelEv_library
quite 
simple 
and 
helps UnrelEv_library
the 
line 
move RelNScrEv_library
more 
quickly 
than 
waiting ScrEv_wait
at 
the 
circulation 
desk 
. 
once 
it 
is UnrelEv_library
checkout 
out 
, 
i 
will 
get ScrEv_get_receipt
a 
reciept 
telling RelNScrEv_library
me 
when 
the

is+due ScrEv_return_book
and 
i 
am UnrelEv_library
free 
to 
go ScrEv_leave

<end_of_story>_library 
a 
few 
months 
ago 
, 
i 
went ScrEv_get_library
to 
the 
library 
to 
check+out+a+couple+of+books Evoking_library
. 
our 
local 
library 
is UnrelEv_library
very 
large 
and 
full 
of 
very 
interesting 
books 
, 
magazines 
and 
movies 
. 
before 
i 
went ScrEv_get_shelf
to 
find ScrEv_look_for_book
my 
books 
, 
i 
stopped RelNScrEv_library
at 
the 
coffee 
shop 
in 
the 
library 
. 
i 
ordered RelNScrEv_library
a 
coffee 
and 
a 
blueberry 
muffin 
so 
i 
could 
have RelNScrEv_library
a 
snack 
. 
once 
i 
finished RelNScrEv_library
my 
snack 
, 
i 
began UnrelEv_library
to 
look+for ScrEv_look_for_book
my 
books 
. 
i 
used ScrEv_use_computer
the 
library 
's 
computer 
to 
find ScrEv_use_computer
the 
location 
of 
each 
book 
. 
finding ScrEv_look_for_book
the 
books 
only 
took UnrelEv_library
me 
about 
523 
minutes 
. 
after 
i 
found ScrEv_take_book
the 
books 
, 
i 
sat+down RelNScrEv_library
in 
a 
comfortable 
chair 
that 
was UnrelEv_library
next 
to 
a 
lamp 
. 
i 
began UnrelEv_library
reading RelNScrEv_library
one 
of 
my 
books 
while 
i 
was 
drinking RelNScrEv_library
my 
coffee 
. 
i 
stayed RelNScrEv_library
at 
the 
library 
and 
read RelNScrEv_library
for 
about 
thirty 
minutes 
. 
i 
went ScrEv_go_check_out
to 
the 
checkout

check+out ScrEv_register
my 
books 
, 
and 
then 
i 
left ScrEv_leave

books 
are UnrelEv_library
invaluable 
tools

bring UnrelEv_library
you 
on 
wonderful 
adventures 
. 
everyone 
should 
read RelNScrEv_library
as 
many 
as 
they 
possibly 
can UnrelEv_library
! 
the 
best 
way 
to 
do UnrelEv_library
so 
is UnrelEv_library
to 
borrow+a+book+from+the+library Evoking_library
. 
when 
i 
borrow+a+book+from+the+library Evoking_library
, 
i 
first 
obtained ScrEv_obtain_card
a 
library 
card 
. 
i 
did UnrelEv_library
this 
by 
going ScrEv_get_library
to 
my 
local 
library 
, 
and 
speaking ScrEv_ask_librarian
with 
a 
librarian 
, 
there 
i 
created RelNScrEv_library
an 
account 
with 
my

following UnrelEv_library
this 
, 
and 
following UnrelEv_library
the 
successful 
attainment 
of 
my 
physical 
card 
, 
i 
began ScrEv_look_for_book
my 
search 
for 
a 
book 
. 
in 
the 
old 
days 
i 
would 
need 
to 
use ScrEv_check_catalog
a 
card 
catalog 
, 
these 
days 
i 
can 
search ScrEv_use_computer
through 
books 
on 
a 
library 
computer 
. 
i 
search ScrEv_use_computer
through 
many 
genres 
and 
types 
of 
books 
before 
making RelNScrEv_library
my 
decision 
. 
i 
then 
write+down ScrEv_note_shelf
the 
number 
of 
the 
book 
and 
begin ScrEv_look_for_book
my 
search 
. 
i 
find ScrEv_get_shelf
the

bookshelves 
and 
then 
find ScrEv_look_for_book
the 
matching RelNScrEv_library
book 
number 
. 
book 
in 
hand 
, 
i 
gleefully 
skip ScrEv_go_check_out
to 
the 
checkout 
, 
and 
check ScrEv_register
my 
book 
out 
with 
the 
librarian 
, 
making+sure UnrelEv_library
to 
note RelNScrEv_library
the 
time 
which 
i

<end_of_story>_library 
i 
decided UnrelEv_library
to 
borrow+some+books+from+the+library Evoking_library
. 
i 
went ScrEv_get_library
to 
the 
library 
and 
started UnrelEv_library
looking ScrEv_look_for_book
on 
the 
shelves 
. 
there 
were UnrelEv_library
so 
many 
good 
books 
that 
it 
was UnrelEv_library
difficult 
to 
pick+out ScrEv_take_book
just 
a 
few 
, 
so 
i 
used ScrEv_use_computer
the 
library 
's 
computer 
book 
search 
program 
. 
eventually 
i 
chose ScrEv_take_book
several 
modern 
plays 
, 
a 
biography 
, 
and 
a 
book 
on 
ancient 
rome 
. 
i 
took ScrEv_go_check_out
these 
books 
up 
to 
the 
librarian 
's 
desk 
and 
asked ScrEv_ask_librarian
if 
i 
could 
check ScrEv_register
them 
out 
. 
she 
said ScrEv_ask_librarian
yes 
, 
i 
could 
borrow+the+books Evoking_library
, 
but 
i 
needed 
to 
sign+up ScrEv_obtain_card
for 
a 
library 
card 
. 
i 
filled+out RelNScrEv_library
the 
form 
, 
and 
she 
took RelNScrEv_library
it 
. 
then 
she 
made RelNScrEv_library
my 
library 
card 
and 
gave RelNScrEv_library
it 
to 
me 
. 
with 
this 
accomplished UnrelEv_library
, 
i 
was UnrelEv_library
able 
to 
check+out ScrEv_register
my 
books 
. 
she 
put ScrEv_get_receipt
a 
card 
in 
each 
one 
with 
a 
date 
stamped RelNScrEv_library
on 
it 
. 
this 
was UnrelEv_library
the 
date 
the 
books 
were UnrelEv_library
due 
to 
be 
returned ScrEv_return_book
. 
i 
promised UnrelEv_library
to 
return ScrEv_return_book
them 
on 
time 
and 
took ScrEv_leave
the 
books 
home 
to 
read RelNScrEv_library
. 
<end_of_story>_library 
i 
had UnrelEv_library
the 
day 
off 
today 
so 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_library
to 
relax UnrelEv_library
and 
read RelNScrEv_library
a 
new 
book 
. 
i 
decided UnrelEv_library
to 
go ScrEv_get_library
to 
the 
library 
and 
check+one+out Evoking_library
. 
i 
got RelNScrEv_library
my 
library 
card 
from 
my 
wallet 
and 
walked ScrEv_get_library
to 
the 
library 
. 
i 
looked ScrEv_look_for_book
around 
some 
of 
the 
different 
sections 
in 
the 
library 
and 
found ScrEv_take_book
a 
book 
in 
the 
fiction 
section 
that 
looked RelNScrEv_library
interesting 
. 
i 
took ScrEv_go_check_out
it 
up 
to 
the 
front 
counter 
and 
handed ScrEv_register
the 
librarian 
the 
book 
and 
my 
library 
card 
. 
she 
scanned ScrEv_register
the 
book 
and 
my 
card 
, 
told RelNScrEv_library
me 
when 
the 
book 
was+due ScrEv_return_book
back 
and 
then 
handed RelNScrEv_library
the 
card 
and 
the 
book 
back 
to 
me 
. 
on 
the 
way 
out 
, 
i 
grabbed RelNScrEv_library
a 
bookmark 
from 
a 
table 
set 
up 
near 
the 
door 
. 
i 
walked ScrEv_leave
home 
and 
began UnrelEv_library
to 
read RelNScrEv_library
my 
book 
. 
a 
week 
later 
when 
i 
was 
done UnrelEv_library
reading RelNScrEv_library
it 
, 
i 
returned ScrEv_return_book
the 
book 
to 
the 
library 
and 
found ScrEv_take_book
a 
new 
one 
to 
check+out Evoking_library
and 
take ScrEv_leave
home 
to 
read RelNScrEv_library
. 
<end_of_story>_library 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_library
to 
get+a+book Evoking_library
on 
gardening UnrelEv_library
, 
so 
i 
went ScrEv_get_library
to 
the 
library 
. 
i 
was UnrelEv_library
n't 
sure 
where 
the 
gardening UnrelEv_library
books 
were UnrelEv_library
, 
so 
i 
went RelNScrEv_library
to 
the 
electronic 
card 
catalog 
and 
looked ScrEv_check_catalog
gardening UnrelEv_library
up 
. 
i 
found ScrEv_check_catalog
the 
dewey 
decimal 
number 
and 
then 
went ScrEv_get_shelf
down 
the 
rows 
of 
shelves 
until 
i 
got ScrEv_get_shelf
to 
the 
right 
number 
. 
there 
were UnrelEv_library
so 
many 
books 
! 
i 
have UnrelEv_library
a 
small 
yard 
, 
so 
i 
thought UnrelEv_library
a 
book 
on 
container 
gardening UnrelEv_library
would 
be UnrelEv_library
best 
. 
i 
chose ScrEv_take_book
one 
with 
lots 
of 
pictures 
. 
i 
then 
took ScrEv_go_check_out
the 
book 
to 
the 
circulation 
desk 
and 
waited ScrEv_wait
in 
line 
behind 
a 
mother 
with 
a 
child 
. 
the 
child 
had Unclear_library
about 
twenty 
picture 
books 
. 
this 
could 
be UnrelEv_library
a 
while 
. 
finally 
, 
it 
was UnrelEv_library
my 
turn 
. 
i 
gave ScrEv_show_card
the 
librarian 
my 
library 
card 
and 
book 
and 
she 
scanned ScrEv_register
them 
both 
in 
a 
laser 
reader 
. 
then 
she 
handed ScrEv_get_receipt
me 
my 
book 
and 
a 
receipt 
. 
looks UnrelEv_library
like 
i 
have UnrelEv_library
three 
weeks 
to 
learn UnrelEv_library
how 
to 
garden UnrelEv_library
! 
<end_of_story>_library 
i 
was 
babysitting UnrelEv_library
my 
nephew 
and 
thought UnrelEv_library
it 
would 
be UnrelEv_library
fun 
to 
take+him+to+the+library Evoking_library
. 
we 
went ScrEv_get_library
to 
the 
local 
library 
. 
he 
was 
excited UnrelEv_library
because 
he 
never 
visited+the+library Evoking_library
before 
. 
we 
picked+out ScrEv_take_book
some 
books 
that 
were UnrelEv_library
in 
the 
children 
's 
section 
. 
he 
is 
interested UnrelEv_library
in 
dinosaurs 
. 
we 
picked ScrEv_take_book
the 
ones 
with 
big 
pictures 
. 
i 
told UnrelEv_library
him 
he 
could 
borrow ScrEv_register
three 
. 
i 
almost 
got ScrEv_take_book
a 
book 
for 
myself 
but 
i 
need 
to 
finish UnrelEv_library
the 
ones 
i 
already 
started UnrelEv_library
. 
we 
checked+out ScrEv_register
the 
books 
and 
i 
let UnrelEv_library
him 
hand RelNScrEv_library
them 
to 
the 
librarian 
. 
they 
had UnrelEv_library
a 
record 
of 
me 
and 
issued ScrEv_obtain_card
me 
a 
new 
card 
. 
we 
went ScrEv_leave
to 
the 
park 
and 
read RelNScrEv_library
them 
under 
a 
tree 
. 
then 
we 
went ScrEv_get_library
back 
to 
the 
library 
and 
i 
let UnrelEv_library
him 
return ScrEv_return_book
them 
in 
the 
metal 
bin 
out 
front 
. 
over 
all 
i 
think UnrelEv_library
it 
was UnrelEv_library
a 
day 
he 
will 
remember UnrelEv_library
. 
<end_of_story>_library 
i 
love UnrelEv_library
to 
read RelNScrEv_library
, 
and 
today 
i 
remembered UnrelEv_library
that 
i 
had 
already 
finished RelNScrEv_library
my 
last 
mystery 
novel 
. 
so 
now 
it 
was UnrelEv_library
time 
to 
head ScrEv_get_library
back 
to 
the 
library 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_library
a 
short 
walk 
, 
but 
one 
i 
enjoyed UnrelEv_library
as 
i 
considered UnrelEv_library
what 
kind 
of 
stories 
i 
would 
check+out Evoking_library
next 
. 
i 
dropped ScrEv_return_book
my 
return 
books 
into 
the 
slot 
at 
the 
entrance 
, 
and 
entered ScrEv_get_library
the 
library 
. 
oh 
how 
i 
love UnrelEv_library
the 
smell 
of 
books 
! 
i 
made ScrEv_get_shelf
my 
way 
over 
to 
the 
fiction 
area 
, 
and 
randomly 
layed ScrEv_look_for_book
eyes 
on 
the 
book 
bindings 
, 
until 
a 
title 
would 
catch RelNScrEv_library
my 
eye 
. 
after 
523 
to 
523 
more 
, 
i 
would 
take ScrEv_go_check_out
my 
selections 
to 
the 
check 
out 
desk 
. 
the 
librarian 
, 
who 
knows UnrelEv_library
me 
well 
, 
smiled RelNScrEv_library
and 
noted ScrEv_register
the 
books 
i 
had 
chosen ScrEv_take_book
in 
the 
system 
. 
the 
library 
has UnrelEv_library
a 
scanner 
now 
. 
it 
makes Unclear_library
the 
check 
out 
process 
so 
much 
faster 
now 
. 
i 
picked+up RelNScrEv_library
the 
books 
on 
the 
other 
side 
, 
placed ScrEv_other_library
them 
in 
my 
bag 
, 
and 
stepped+out ScrEv_leave
into 
the 
autumn 
air 
. 
<end_of_story>_library 
i 
was 
sitting UnrelEv_library
home 
on 
a 
saturday 
afternoon 
and 
was 
quite 
bored UnrelEv_library
. 
i 
decided UnrelEv_library
that 
i 
would 
enjoy UnrelEv_library
reading RelNScrEv_library
, 
but 
i 
did 
n't 
have UnrelEv_library
any 
books 
that 
i 
had 
n't 
read RelNScrEv_library
at 
home 
. 
so 
, 
off 
i 
went+to+the+library Evoking_library
. 
i 
got RelNScrEv_library
in 
my 
car 
and 
drove ScrEv_get_library
a 
mile 
down 
the 
street 
until 
i 
reached ScrEv_get_library
the 
library 
. 
once 
there 
i 
browsed ScrEv_look_for_book
through 
the 
fiction 
books 
as 
those 
are UnrelEv_library
my 
favorite 
until 
i 
found ScrEv_look_for_book
a 
book 
that 
i 
thought UnrelEv_library
i 
would 
like UnrelEv_library
to 
read RelNScrEv_library
. 
i 
picked+up ScrEv_take_book
the 
book 
and 
took ScrEv_go_check_out
it 
up 
to 
the 
front 
desk 
. 
i 
pulled+out RelNScrEv_library
my 
library 
card 
and 
the 
librarian 
scanned ScrEv_register
the 
book 
and 
then 
scanned ScrEv_show_card
my 
card 
. 
she 
put RelNScrEv_library
a 
bookmark 
in 
the 
book 
and 
told RelNScrEv_library
me 
when 
the 
book 
would 
be+due ScrEv_return_book
back 
. 
i 
thanked RelNScrEv_library
her 
and 
proceeded UnrelEv_library
to 
walk+out ScrEv_leave
to 
my 
car 
. 
i 
drove RelNScrEv_library
home 
and 
began UnrelEv_library
reading RelNScrEv_library
the 
book 
and 
it 
was UnrelEv_library
very 
enjoyable 
to 
read RelNScrEv_library
. 
<end_of_story>_library 
yesterday 
, 
i 
decided UnrelEv_library
that 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_library
to 
read RelNScrEv_library
a 
book 
and 
went+to+the+library Evoking_library
with 
my 
friend 
. 
we 
entered ScrEv_get_library
the 
library 
and 
started UnrelEv_library
browsing ScrEv_look_for_book
through 
all 
the 
books 
. 
i 
remembered UnrelEv_library
a 
mystery 
novel 
that 
i 
had 
read+about UnrelEv_library
and 
wanted UnrelEv_library
to 
read RelNScrEv_library
. 
i 
went RelNScrEv_library
to 
the 
library 
's 
computer 
and 
looked+up ScrEv_use_computer
the 
title 
of 
the 
mystery 
book 
to 
see UnrelEv_library
if 
it 
was UnrelEv_library
available 
. 
luckily 
, 
it 
was UnrelEv_library
available 
for 
me 
to 
check ScrEv_register
. 
i 
wrote+down ScrEv_note_shelf
the 
call 
number 
and 
located ScrEv_look_for_book
the 
book 
in 
the 
stacks 
. 
i 
found RelNScrEv_library
my 
friend 
and 
told UnrelEv_library
her 
that 
i 
found ScrEv_take_book
a 
book 
that 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_library
to 
borrow Evoking_library
and 
was UnrelEv_library
ready 
to 
check+out ScrEv_register
. 
i 
waited ScrEv_wait
in 
line 
at 
the 
checkout 
counter 
and 
when 
i 
reached RelNScrEv_library
the 
front 
of 
the 
line 
, 
i 
greeted RelNScrEv_library
the 
librarian 
. 
i 
handed RelNScrEv_library
him 
the 
book 
and 
my 
library 
card 
and 
he 
scanned ScrEv_register
both 
into 
the 
library 
's 
system 
, 
successfully 
borrowing+the+mystery+book Evoking_library
. 
i 
started UnrelEv_library
reading RelNScrEv_library
it 
today 
and 
it 
is UnrelEv_library
really 
good 
. 
i 
'm UnrelEv_library
so 
happy 
i 
found ScrEv_take_book
it 
at 
the 
library 
yesterday 
. 
<end_of_story>_library 
today 
i 
decided UnrelEv_library
to 
pick+out+a+book Evoking_library
from 
the 
library 
. 
i 
got RelNScrEv_library
in 
my 
car 
and 
drove ScrEv_get_library
a 
couple 
of 
miles 
from 
my 
house 
down 
to 
the 
library 
. 
i 
walked ScrEv_get_library
inside 
. 
i 
began UnrelEv_library
by 
looking ScrEv_look_for_book
through 
the 
fiction 
section 
. 
i 
scanned ScrEv_look_for_book
the 
rows 
of 
books 
for 
familiar 
author 
names 
or 
interesting 
titles 
. 
i 
picked+up ScrEv_take_book
a 
few 
books 
and 
read RelNScrEv_library
the 
first 
page 
or 
so 
of 
each 
one 
. 
once 
i 
found ScrEv_take_book
one 
that 
looked UnrelEv_library
like 
it 
would 
be UnrelEv_library
a 
good 
read 
, 
i 
picked ScrEv_take_book
it 
up 
and 
took ScrEv_go_check_out
it 
over 
to 
the 
front 
counter 
. 
there 
was UnrelEv_library
a 
short 
line 
, 
so 
i 
waited ScrEv_wait
while 
other 
people 
signed+up ScrEv_obtain_card
for 
library 
cards 
and 
checked+out ScrEv_register
books 
. 
once 
i 
arrived UnrelEv_library
at 
the 
counter 
, 
the 
librarian 
took RelNScrEv_library
my 
book 
and 
scanned ScrEv_register
it 
. 
she 
told UnrelEv_library
me 
it 
would 
be+due ScrEv_return_book
two 
weeks 
from 
now 
, 
and 
gave ScrEv_get_receipt
me 
a 
receipt 
. 
i 
thanked RelNScrEv_library
her 
and 
exited ScrEv_leave
the 
library 
. 
<end_of_story>_library 
there 
is UnrelEv_library
a 
book 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_library
to 
read RelNScrEv_library
. 
however 
, 
i 
was UnrelEv_library
n't 
sure 
if 
it 
was UnrelEv_library
a 
book 
i 
actually 
wanted UnrelEv_library
to 
buy UnrelEv_library
. 
instead 
, 
i 
decided UnrelEv_library
to 
go ScrEv_get_library
to 
the 
public 
library 
to 
see UnrelEv_library
if 
i 
could 
borrow+it Evoking_library
. 
once 
i 
got ScrEv_get_library
to 
the 
library 
, 
i 
decided UnrelEv_library
to 
use ScrEv_check_catalog
the 
card 
catalog 
to 
see UnrelEv_library
if 
the 
particular 
book 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_library
was 
carried RelNScrEv_library
by 
the 
library 
. 
luckily 
, 
it 
was UnrelEv_library
. 
i 
used UnrelEv_library
the 
paper 
and 
pen 
provided UnrelEv_library
to 
write+down ScrEv_note_shelf
the 
aisle 
and 
shelf 
number 
where 
the 
book 
would 
be 
located UnrelEv_library
. 
walking ScrEv_get_shelf
down 
the 
aisles 
of 
shelves 
, 
i 
found ScrEv_get_shelf
the 
one 
where 
my 
book 
should 
have 
been UnrelEv_library
. 
however 
, 
it 
was UnrelEv_library
n't 
there 
. 
i 
then 
went ScrEv_go_check_out
to 
the 
front 
desk 
and 
asked ScrEv_ask_librarian
the 
librarian 
if 
the 
book 
was RelNScrEv_library
out 
. 
she 
told UnrelEv_library
me 
it 
had 
just 
come+back ScrEv_return_book
in 
, 
and 
if 
i 
could 
wait ScrEv_wait
a 
bit 
for 
it 
to 
be 
processed RelNScrEv_library
, 
i 
could 
then 
borrow ScrEv_register
it 
. 
once 
she 
checked ScrEv_return_book
it 
in 
, 
she 
let UnrelEv_library
me 
have ScrEv_take_book
it 
and 
i 
then 
checked ScrEv_register
it 
out 
. 
i 
had 
to 
show ScrEv_show_card
her 
my 
library 
card 
, 
and 
she 
told RelNScrEv_library
me 
my 
due 
date 
to 
return ScrEv_return_book
the 
book 
was UnrelEv_library
in 
two 
weeks 
. 
<end_of_story>_library 
i 
needed UnrelEv_library
a 
book 
to 
read RelNScrEv_library
with 
a 
young 
relative 
of 
mine 
and 
decided UnrelEv_library
to 
borrow+it+from+the+library Evoking_library
rather 
than 
buy UnrelEv_library
it 
. 
the 
local 
library 
is UnrelEv_library
only 
a 
few 
blocks 
away 
to 
i 
walked ScrEv_get_library
there 
. 
i 
am UnrelEv_library
familiar 
with 
the 
computers 
and 
the 
process 
for 
looking+up ScrEv_use_computer
to 
see UnrelEv_library
if 
a 
book 
is UnrelEv_library
available 
and 
where 
it 
is 
located RelNScrEv_library
on 
the 
shelf 
. 
the 
computer 
lookup 
station 
was UnrelEv_library
available 
and 
quickly 
i 
was 
given ScrEv_use_computer
the 
location 
of 
the 
book 
. 
the 
book 
was 
located RelNScrEv_library
in 
the 
proper 
location 
on 
the 
shelf 
. 
i 
selected ScrEv_take_book
the 
book 
and 
went ScrEv_go_check_out
to 
the 
counter 
to 
check ScrEv_register
it 
out 
. 
there 
were UnrelEv_library
a 
few 
people 
in 
line 
ahead 
of 
me 
, 
but 
the 
wait 
was ScrEv_wait
short 
. 
after 
scanning ScrEv_register
my 
library 
card 
and 
then 
the 
book 
the 
librarian 
asked RelNScrEv_library
if 
i 
needed RelNScrEv_library
a 
plastic 
bag 
to 
keep RelNScrEv_library
the 
book 
dry 
as 
it 
had 
started+raining UnrelEv_library
. 
i 
declined RelNScrEv_library
the 
offer 
of 
the 
bag 
as 
i 
had RelNScrEv_library
a 
waterproof 
backpack 
. 
i 
left ScrEv_leave
with 
my 
book 
. 
<end_of_story>_library 
a 
week 
ago 
i 
decided UnrelEv_library
i 
wanted UnrelEv_library
to 
go ScrEv_get_library
to 
the 
local 
library 
and 
borrow+a+book Evoking_library
. 
this 
is UnrelEv_library
something 
i 
have 
n't 
done UnrelEv_library
since 
i 
was UnrelEv_library
a 
kid 
, 
so 
i 
was UnrelEv_library
n't 
sure 
if 
the 
process 
had 
changed UnrelEv_library
. 
i 
drove ScrEv_get_library
over 
to 
the 
library 
which 
was UnrelEv_library
about 
523 
miles 
away 
from 
my 
house 
. 
when 
i 
arrived ScrEv_get_library
i 
walked ScrEv_get_library
inside 
and 
was 
surprised UnrelEv_library
to 
discover UnrelEv_library
the 
interior 
had 
dramatically 
changed UnrelEv_library
since 
the 
last 
time 
i 
had 
been Unclear_library
there 
. 
once 
i 
composed UnrelEv_library
myself 
, 
i 
began UnrelEv_library
my 
quest 
to 
search ScrEv_look_for_book
for 
a 
good 
book 
. 
i 
did UnrelEv_library
n't 
have 
anything 
particular 
in 
mind 
, 
but 
then 
i 
thought+back UnrelEv_library
to 
the 
times 
when 
i 
was UnrelEv_library
a 
kid 
and 
liked RelNScrEv_library
books 
about 
medieval 
history 
. 
so 
i 
went ScrEv_get_shelf
over 
to 
the 
history 
section 
to 
see ScrEv_look_for_book
what 
they 
had RelNScrEv_library
. 
i 
found ScrEv_take_book
a 
book 
about 
knights 
and 
medieval 
combat 
that 
looked RelNScrEv_library
interesting 
, 
so 
i 
took ScrEv_go_check_out
it 
to 
the 
front 
desk 
to 
check+out ScrEv_register
. 
i 
first 
had 
to 
sign+up ScrEv_obtain_card
for 
a 
library 
card 
, 
and 
after 
that 
was 
done UnrelEv_library
i 
drove ScrEv_leave
home 
with 
the 
book 
. 
<end_of_story>_library 
i 
needed UnrelEv_library
a 
book 
about 
gardening UnrelEv_library
. 
so 
i 
went+to+the+nearby+public+library Evoking_library
to 
see UnrelEv_library
if 
they 
had UnrelEv_library
a 
book 
that 
would 
be UnrelEv_library
useful 
to 
me 
. 
i 
walked ScrEv_get_library
into 
the 
building 
and 
found RelNScrEv_library
the 
nonfiction 
section 
. 
i 
then 
sat RelNScrEv_library
at 
a 
computer 
and 
did ScrEv_use_computer
a 
search 
for 
gardening 
books 
. 
lots 
of 
books 
showed+up ScrEv_use_computer
on 
my 
search 
. 
i 
took RelNScrEv_library
a 
small 
pencil 
and 
piece 
of 
paper 
that 
were 
sitting UnrelEv_library
next 
to 
the 
computer 
and 
wrote+down ScrEv_note_shelf
several 
book 
titles 
with 
their 
call 
numbers 
next 
to 
them 
. 
i 
then 
looked ScrEv_get_shelf
at 
the 
shelves 
for 
the 
corresponding UnrelEv_library
call 
numbers 
. 
when 
i 
found ScrEv_get_shelf
my 
section 
, 
i 
then 
looked+for ScrEv_look_for_book
the 
exact 
numbers 
to 
find ScrEv_look_for_book
the 
books 
i 
had 
found ScrEv_use_computer
on 
the 
computer 
search 
. 
i 
found ScrEv_look_for_book
the 
books 
and 
took ScrEv_take_book
them 
out 
of 
the 
shelf 
to 
get RelNScrEv_library
a 
better 
look 
. 
after 
browsing RelNScrEv_library
through 
them 
for 
a 
few 
minutes 
, 
i 
decided UnrelEv_library
that 
i 
did 
want ScrEv_take_book
these 
books 
. 
i 
picked ScrEv_take_book
them 
up 
and 
walked+over ScrEv_go_check_out
to 
the 
circulation 
desk 
. 
i 
handed ScrEv_show_card
the 
librarian 
my 
library 
card 
and 
the 
books 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_library
to 
get ScrEv_register
. 
she 
checked ScrEv_register
them 
out 
for 
me 
, 
and 
told RelNScrEv_library
me 
when 
they 
were+due ScrEv_return_book
. 
i 
then 
walked+out ScrEv_leave
of 
the 
library 
with 
my 
books 
. 
<end_of_story>_library 
i 
have UnrelEv_library
many 
local 
libraries 
where 
i 
can 
borrow+books Evoking_library
for 
reading 
pleasure 
and 
reference 
without 
having 
to 
buy UnrelEv_library
the 
books 
. 
i 
first 
find RelNScrEv_library
my 
valid 
library 
card 
and 
visit+my+local+library Evoking_library
. 
the 
library 
is UnrelEv_library
quiet 
with 
many 
different 
types 
of 
people 
there 
. 
it 
is+relaxing UnrelEv_library
place 
to 
just 
sit RelNScrEv_library
and 
browse RelNScrEv_library
through 
some 
books 
. 
i 
ask ScrEv_ask_librarian
the 
librarian 
for 
help 
in 
finding ScrEv_look_for_book
some 
travel 
books 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_library
to 
borrow ScrEv_register
for 
my 
trip 
. 
she 
is UnrelEv_library
very 
helpful 
and 
directs RelNScrEv_library
me 
to 
the 
area 
where 
the 
travel 
books 
are UnrelEv_library
. 
i 
look ScrEv_look_for_book
through 
the 
shelves 
and 
find ScrEv_take_book
the 
books 
i 
need UnrelEv_library
. 
i 
check ScrEv_register
them 
out 
and 
borrow ScrEv_register
them 
with 
my 
library 
card 
. 
i 
have UnrelEv_library
a 
certain 
amount 
of 
time 
to 
return ScrEv_return_book
the 
books 
so 
i 
will 
make+sure UnrelEv_library
to 
return ScrEv_return_book
them 
on 
time 
in 
good 
condition 
so 
that 
i 
do 
not 
get UnrelEv_library
fined RelNScrEv_library
. 
i 
leave ScrEv_leave
the 
library 
satisfied UnrelEv_library
with 
the 
books 
i 
borrowed ScrEv_register
. 
<end_of_story>_library 
i 
'd 
been 
looking+forward UnrelEv_library
to 
reading RelNScrEv_library
tigerman 
, 
the 
new 
novel 
by 
my 
favorite 
writer 
, 
nick 
harkaway 
. 
however 
, 
i 
do 
n't 
like 
paying RelNScrEv_library
for 
the 
hard 
cover 
editions 
of 
books 
, 
and 
the 
paperback 
version 
would 
not 
be 
released UnrelEv_library
for 
another 
year 
. 
i 
therefore 
decided UnrelEv_library
to 
walk+to+my+local+library Evoking_library
and 
borrow+the+book Evoking_library
. 
to 
my 
disappointment 
, 
it 
was 
already 
checked+out RelNScrEv_library
, 
but 
i 
was 
able 
to 
place ScrEv_other_library
a 
hold 
on 
the 
book 
. 
six 
weeks 
later 
, 
the 
library 
sent ScrEv_other_library
me 
an 
e-mail 
to 
let UnrelEv_library
me 
know 
that 
tigerman 
had 
been 
returned RelNScrEv_library
and 
i 
could 
now 
check RelNScrEv_library
it 
out 
. 
i 
stopped+by ScrEv_get_library
on 
my 
way 
home 
from 
work 
that 
evening 
, 
and 
got ScrEv_other_library
the 
book 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_library
a 
fun 
read 
, 
but 
i 
was 
not 
able 
to 
finish UnrelEv_library
it 
by 
the 
due 
date 
, 
so 
i 
went UnrelEv_library
online 
and 
obtained ScrEv_other_library
an 
extension 
of 
the 
due 
date 
. 
a 
few 
days 
later 
, 
i 
finished UnrelEv_library
the 
book 
, 
which 
was 
wonderful 
. 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_library
other 
people 
to 
be 
able 
to 
enjoy UnrelEv_library
it 
too 
, 
so 
i 
promptly 
returned ScrEv_return_book
the 
book 
to 
the 
library 
. 
<end_of_story>_library 
i 
often 
make+several+trips+to+the+library Evoking_library
so 
my 
library 
card 
is UnrelEv_library
always 
left 
in 
my 
wallet 
and 
i 
never 
have 
to 
search UnrelEv_library
for 
it 
. 
today 
, 
i 
had 
to 
return ScrEv_return_book
a 
book 
but 
i 
also 
wanted UnrelEv_library
to 
borrow Evoking_library
a 
new 
one 
. 
i 
had 
recently 
finished UnrelEv_library
an 
introductory 
book 
on 
learning UnrelEv_library
a 
new 
language 
and 
wanted UnrelEv_library
to 
replace RelNScrEv_library
it 
with 
something 
more 
enjoyable 
. 
i 
walked ScrEv_get_library
out 
to 
the 
library 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_library
only 
a 
few 
minutes 
away 
and 
i 
only 
had 
to 
cross UnrelEv_library
a 
few 
streets 
. 
walking+past UnrelEv_library
the 
small 
store 
, 
i 
found ScrEv_go_check_out
the 
reception 
desk 
where 
a 
librarian 
was 
waiting UnrelEv_library
for 
me 
. 
i 
checked ScrEv_register
back 
in 
my 
book 
on 
a 
new 
language 
and 
checked ScrEv_look_for_book
the 
rest 
of 
the 
library 
. 
i 
scanned ScrEv_look_for_book
the 
aisles 
for 
the 
fiction 
and 
fantasy 
sections 
. 
once 
found RelNScrEv_library
, 
i 
just 
picked ScrEv_take_book
some 
random 
books 
until 
i 
was 
able 
to 
choose ScrEv_take_book
one 
that 
seemed UnrelEv_library
interesting 
enough 
to 
read RelNScrEv_library
. 
i 
took ScrEv_go_check_out
my 
book 
back 
to 
the 
reception 
desk 
and 
had 
it 
checked+out ScrEv_register
with 
my 
library 
card 
. 
<end_of_story>_library 
today 
i 
decided UnrelEv_library
to 
borrow+a+book Evoking_library
from 
the 
local 
library 
. 
i 
got+dressed UnrelEv_library
and 
headed+out ScrEv_get_library
to 
the 
library 
. 
i 
was UnrelEv_library
n't 
really 
sure 
what 
kind 
of 
book 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_library
, 
other 
than 
a 
good 
novel 
or 
piece 
of 
fantasy 
fiction 
, 
so 
i 
started ScrEv_look_for_book
my 
search 
in 
the 
fiction 
section 
. 
i 
browsed ScrEv_other_library
the 
first 
few 
pages 
of 
several 
books 
while 
i 
was 
at 
the 
library 
to 
see 
if 
any 
interested UnrelEv_library
me 
. 
eventually 
, 
i 
came+across ScrEv_take_book
a 
fantasy 
novel 
that 
looked UnrelEv_library
really 
interesting UnrelEv_library
to 
me 
. 
i 
took ScrEv_take_book
it 
up 
to 
the 
librarian 
and 
borrowed ScrEv_other_library
the 
book 
out 
for 
a 
week 
. 
the 
librarian 
collected ScrEv_other_library
some 
information 
for 
me 
and 
asked+for ScrEv_show_card
my 
library 
card 
, 
before 
stamping ScrEv_other_library
my 
name 
in 
the 
back 
of 
the 
book 
. 
i 
took ScrEv_leave
the 
book 
home 
and 
read RelNScrEv_library
it 
over 
the 
next 
several 
days 
. 
once 
i 
was 
done UnrelEv_library
, 
i 
made+sure UnrelEv_library
to 
return ScrEv_return_book
the 
book 
to 
the 
library 
before 
the 
due 
date 
, 
dropping ScrEv_return_book
it 
off 
in 
the 
library 
's 
return 
box 
. 
<end_of_story>_library 
i 
was 
talking UnrelEv_library
to 
my 
friend 
the 
other 
day 
and 
she 
told UnrelEv_library
me 
about 
a 
book 
that 
she 
thought+was UnrelEv_library
very 
interesting 
. 
i 
decided UnrelEv_library
i 
could 
borrow+the+book+from+the+library Evoking_library
. 
i 
went ScrEv_get_library
to 
my 
local 
library 
and 
had 
to 
sign+up RelNScrEv_library
as 
a 
member 
because 
i 
previously 
was UnrelEv_library
not 
a 
member 
. 
after 
signing+up ScrEv_obtain_card
for 
a 
membership 
, 
i 
now 
had UnrelEv_library
two 
options 
; 
i 
could 
ask RelNScrEv_library
the 
librarian 
for 
help 
, 
or 
i 
could 
use RelNScrEv_library
the 
self 
service 
computers 
and 
find RelNScrEv_library
the 
location 
of 
my 
book 
on 
my 
own 
. 
i 
chose UnrelEv_library
to 
find UnrelEv_library
the 
book 
on 
my 
own 
, 
because 
if 
i 
can 
avoid+dealing UnrelEv_library
with 
people 
i 
will 
always 
pick UnrelEv_library
that 
option 
. 
so 
i 
go ScrEv_use_computer
on 
the 
computer 
and 
type ScrEv_use_computer
the 
name 
of 
the 
book 
in 
. 
it 
tells UnrelEv_library
me 
the 
location 
the 
book 
should 
be UnrelEv_library
in 
. 
now 
i 
go ScrEv_get_shelf
to 
the 
location 
. 
i 
find ScrEv_other_library
the 
book 
right 
where 
it 
's+supposed UnrelEv_library
to 
be 
. 
last 
, 
i 
check ScrEv_register
the 
book 
out 
at 
the 
front 
desk 
. 
i 
will 
have 
to 
return RelNScrEv_library
it 
in 
523 
week 
or 
i 
will 
be 
charged RelNScrEv_library
a 
fee 
. 
<end_of_story>_library 
for 
a 
long 
time 
, 
i 
was 
planning UnrelEv_library
to 
read RelNScrEv_library
a 
book 
about 
stock 
trading 
. 
when 
i 
went UnrelEv_library
online 
most 
of 
the 
books 
were UnrelEv_library
quite 
expensive 
. 
but 
there 
was UnrelEv_library
a 
library 
very 
close 
to 
my 
house 
. 
that 
lead UnrelEv_library
me 
to 
think+about UnrelEv_library
borrowing+one+book+from+the+library Evoking_library
. 
one 
saturday 
morning 
i 
went ScrEv_get_library
there 
and 
browsed ScrEv_other_library
several 
books 
. 
i 
spent UnrelEv_library
almost 
523 
hours 
to 
finalize RelNScrEv_library
a 
book 
. 
finally 
i 
stood ScrEv_go_check_out
in 
the 
line 
for 
the 
check 
out 
counter 
. 
when 
it 
was UnrelEv_library
my 
turn 
, 
i 
gave ScrEv_other_library
the 
person 
at 
the 
counter 
the 
book 
that 
i 
chose RelNScrEv_library
. 
they 
asked RelNScrEv_library
me 
for 
the 
membership 
card 
but 
that 
is 
when 
i 
realized UnrelEv_library
that 
i 
did 
n't 
have UnrelEv_library
one 
. 
i 
decided UnrelEv_library
to 
apply RelNScrEv_library
for 
a 
new 
membership 
card 
. 
all 
that 
was 
needed UnrelEv_library
for 
the 
membership 
application 
was 
my 
id 
card 
. 
i 
gave RelNScrEv_library
them 
my 
driving 
license 
. 
i 
was 
given ScrEv_obtain_card
a 
new 
membership 
card 
within 
523 
minutes 
. 
i 
used ScrEv_show_card
it 
to 
borrow ScrEv_other_library
the 
book 
that 
i 
selected RelNScrEv_library
. 
i 
was 
told UnrelEv_library
that 
the 
book 
needs UnrelEv_library
to 
be 
returned RelNScrEv_library
within 
523 
days 
. 
overall 
the 
experience 
was UnrelEv_library
a 
nice 
one 
and 
i 
would 
keep+going UnrelEv_library
there 
. 
<end_of_story>_library 
i 
love 
reading UnrelEv_library
, 
and 
the 
library 
provides UnrelEv_library
an 
endless 
array 
of 
books 
to 
choose+from RelNScrEv_library
. 
when 
i 
go+to+the+library Evoking_library
, 
i 
browse ScrEv_look_for_book
the 
various 
sections 
to 
select ScrEv_other_library
the 
books 
i 
' 
m 
going 
to 
check+out RelNScrEv_library
. 
sometimes 
i 
' 
m UnrelEv_library
in 
the 
mood 
for 
mystery 
, 
other 
times 
i 
prefer UnrelEv_library
humor 
. 
after 
flipping+through ScrEv_other_library
some 
books 
in 
the 
different 
sections 
, 
i 
make UnrelEv_library
my 
choices 
. 
i 
usually 
choose RelNScrEv_library
a 
few 
books 
to 
check+out+. RelNScrEv_library
with 
my 
selections 
and 
library 
card 
in 
hand 
, 
i 
make ScrEv_go_check_out
my 
way 
to 
the 
front 
desk 
and 
wait ScrEv_wait
in 
line 
. 
when 
it 
is UnrelEv_library
my 
turn 
, 
i 
present ScrEv_show_card
my 
library 
card 
to 
the 
librarian 
. 
she 
scans ScrEv_register
the 
books 
to 
check ScrEv_register
them 
out 
under 
my 
name 
. 
after 
the 
books 
are 
checked+out ScrEv_register
to 
me 
, 
i 
' 
m 
headed ScrEv_leave
home 
. 
i 
have UnrelEv_library
523 
weeks 
to 
enjoy UnrelEv_library
the 
books 
before 
returning ScrEv_return_book
them 
back 
to 
the 
library 
. 
when 
the 
523 
weeks 
are+up UnrelEv_library
, 
i 
return ScrEv_return_book
the 
books 
in 
the 
library 
' 
s 
drop 
box 
, 
and 
look+forward UnrelEv_library
to 
checking+out RelNScrEv_library
a 
new 
batch 
. 
<end_of_story>_library 
my 
sister 
went ScrEv_get_library
to 
the 
library 
to 
borrow+a+book Evoking_library
. 
she 
had UnrelEv_library
a 
library 
card 
from 
the 
city 
library 
. 
she 
took UnrelEv_library
her 
card 
with 
her 
. 
when 
she 
was UnrelEv_library
inside 
the 
library 
, 
she 
sat ScrEv_use_computer
in 
the 
front 
of 
the 
computer 
to 
check ScrEv_check_catalog
the 
catalog 
. 
she 
typed UnrelEv_library
the 
name 
of 
the 
book 
that 
she 
was 
looking+for UnrelEv_library
. 
she 
got UnrelEv_library
the 
number 
from 
the

search 
results 
. 
she 
wrote+down ScrEv_note_shelf
the 
number 
and 
looked+through ScrEv_look_for_book
the 
books 
in 
the 
shelf 
. 
she 
found ScrEv_other_library
the 
book 
rather 
quickly 
. 
she 
made+sure UnrelEv_library
it 
was UnrelEv_library
the 
one 
she 
was 
looking+for UnrelEv_library
. 
she 
then 
went ScrEv_go_check_out
to 
the 
front 
desk 
to 
check+out RelNScrEv_library
the 
book 
. 
the 
staff 
in 
the 
library 
took UnrelEv_library
her 
book 
and 
her 
library 
card 
. 
he 
scanned ScrEv_other_library
her 
card 
from 
the 
machine 
and 
printed ScrEv_other_library
out 
a 
note 
. 
it 
has UnrelEv_library
the 
information 
of 
the 
book 
, 
when 
it 
was 
checked+out RelNScrEv_library
and 
the 
date 
she 
needed UnrelEv_library
to 
return RelNScrEv_library
to 
the 
library 
. 
the 
staff 
told UnrelEv_library
her 
to 
return RelNScrEv_library
before 
the 
date 
to 
avoid UnrelEv_library
any 
penalty 
. 
<end_of_story>_library 
yesterday 
i 
used UnrelEv_library
my 
new 
library 
card 
to 
borrow+a+book Evoking_library
. 
it 
was 
so 
easy 
! 
i 
drove+down ScrEv_get_library
to 
the 
library 
early 
in 
the 
morning 
, 
just 
as 
soon 
as 
the 
library 
opened RelNScrEv_library
. 
when 
i 
entered ScrEv_get_library
the 
library 
, 
i 
said UnrelEv_library
hi 
to 
the 
lady 
behind 
the 
counter 
, 
and 
went+over ScrEv_other_library
to 
the 
science 
fiction 
section 
to 
look+for ScrEv_look_for_book
a 
book 
that 
might 
catch UnrelEv_library
my 
fancy 
. 
i 
soon 
found ScrEv_other_library
a 
very 
good 
looking UnrelEv_library
book 
about 
a 
boy 
who 
meets 
an 
alien 
in 
his 
backyard 
. 
i 
really 
wanted UnrelEv_library
to 
read RelNScrEv_library
the 
book 
, 
but 
i 
knew UnrelEv_library
it 
would 
take UnrelEv_library
me 
a 
few 
days 
, 
so 
i 
decided UnrelEv_library
to 
borrow RelNScrEv_library
it 
for 
awhile 
. 
i 
brought ScrEv_go_check_out
the 
book 
up 
to 
the 
lady 
at 
the 
counter 
, 
and 
she 
asked UnrelEv_library
me 
for 
my 
library 
card 
. 
i 
showed ScrEv_show_card
it 
to 
her 
, 
and 
she 
entered ScrEv_other_library
some 
information 
in 
the 
computer 
. 
she 
told 
me 
to 
bring RelNScrEv_library
the 
book 
back 
in 
one 
week 
. 
i 
promised UnrelEv_library
i 
would 
, 
then 
i 
thanked RelNScrEv_library
her 
and 
went+home ScrEv_leave
to 
read RelNScrEv_library
the 
book 
! 
<end_of_story>_library 
i 
was+about UnrelEv_library
to 
go UnrelEv_library
on 
a 
trip 
and 
i 
knew UnrelEv_library
i 
'd 
want UnrelEv_library
some 
books 
to 
read RelNScrEv_library
on 
the 
plane 
and 
on 
the 
beach 
. 
i 
'd 
spent UnrelEv_library
enough 
money 
on 
this 
trip 
, 
no 
need 
to 
pay UnrelEv_library
for 
books 
too 
! 
instead 
, 
i 
found UnrelEv_library
my 
library 
card 
and 
headed+down+to+my+local+branch+of+the+county+library Evoking_library
. 
there 
, 
i 
perused ScrEv_look_for_book
the 
shelves 
. 
they 
say 
not 
to 
pick RelNScrEv_library
a 
book 
by 
it 
's 
cover 
but 
i 
always 
do UnrelEv_library
. 
i 
always 
find UnrelEv_library
myself 
grabbing RelNScrEv_library
the 
books 
the 
librarians 
have 
put+up UnrelEv_library
on 
display 
on 
top 
of 
the 
shelves 
. 
soon 
i 
had UnrelEv_library
an 
armful 
of 
books 
and 
i 
headed ScrEv_go_check_out
for 
the 
desk 
. 
the 
librarian 
was UnrelEv_library
very 
friendly 
as 
she 
scanned ScrEv_register
a 
code 
inside 
each 
book 
and 
then 
asked ScrEv_other_library
for 
my 
library 
card 
. 
as 
i 
headed ScrEv_leave
for 
the 
door 
, 
she 
reminded RelNScrEv_library
me 
the 
books 
would 
be UnrelEv_library
due 
back 
in 
two 
weeks 
. 
that 
worked+out UnrelEv_library
perfectly 
, 
because 
that 
happened UnrelEv_library
to 
be UnrelEv_library
right 
when 
i 
would 
be+back UnrelEv_library
from 
my 
trip 
. 
<end_of_story>_library 
my 
daughter 
, 
who 
is UnrelEv_library
523 
, 
has 
been 
asking UnrelEv_library
me 
how 
to 
make UnrelEv_library
origami 
animals 
. 
when 
i 
was 
a 
girl 
i 
liked UnrelEv_library
to 
fold UnrelEv_library
origami 
too 
. 
i 
really 
enjoyed UnrelEv_library
all 
the 
colors 
and 
patterns 
available 
. 
i 
did 
not 
remember UnrelEv_library
how 
to 
fold UnrelEv_library
any 
animals 
so 
i 
suggested UnrelEv_library
to 
her 
that 
we 
might 
find+a+book+on+origami+from+the+library Evoking_library
. 
we 
drove ScrEv_get_library
to 
the 
library 
and 
walked ScrEv_other_library
inside 
. 
i 
told UnrelEv_library
her 
we 
could 
ask ScrEv_ask_librarian
the 
librarian 
where 
we 
might 
find RelNScrEv_library
a 
book 
on 
folding UnrelEv_library
origami 
, 
but 
i 
would 
rather 
teach UnrelEv_library
her 
to 
find RelNScrEv_library
the 
book 
on 
her 
own 
. 
we 
headed+over UnrelEv_library
to 
the 
library 
's 
reference 
computer 
and 
opened ScrEv_check_catalog
the 
library 
catalog 
. 
there 
was UnrelEv_library
an 
area 
to 
search UnrelEv_library
by 
the 
books 
subject 
, 
so 
we 
typed+in UnrelEv_library
origami 
. 
several 
books 
came+up UnrelEv_library
. 
i 
told UnrelEv_library
my 
daughter 
to 
write+down ScrEv_note_shelf
the 
location 
of 
the 
books 
that 
looked+interesting UnrelEv_library
to 
her 
. 
she 
found ScrEv_other_library
about 
523 
that 
she 
liked UnrelEv_library
because 
of 
how 
the 
cover 
looked UnrelEv_library
. 
once 
we 
had UnrelEv_library
the 
locations 
we 
went ScrEv_get_shelf
to 
the 
shelf 
to 
find RelNScrEv_library
the 
books 
, 
based+on UnrelEv_library
the 
book 
number 
, 
we 
knew UnrelEv_library
just 
where 
to 
look UnrelEv_library
. 
we 
found ScrEv_other_library
two 
of 
the 
three 
books 
we 
were 
searching+for ScrEv_look_for_book
. 
then 
we 
were UnrelEv_library
ready 
to 
check+out RelNScrEv_library
the 
books 
and 
head UnrelEv_library
home 
. 
i 
got+out UnrelEv_library
my 
library 
card 
and 
we 
went UnrelEv_library
to 
a 
different 
computer 
that 
allows UnrelEv_library
you 
to 
check ScrEv_register
the 
books 
out 
, 
so 
you 
can 
borrow RelNScrEv_library
them 
and 
take UnrelEv_library
them 
home 
for 
a 
few 
weeks 
. 
we 
scanned RelNScrEv_library
my 
card 
, 
and 
the 
books 
and 
the 
machine 
printed UnrelEv_library
a 
slip 
that 
told UnrelEv_library
us 
when 
to 
return RelNScrEv_library
the 
books 
. 
we 
took UnrelEv_library
our 
slip 
and 
headed ScrEv_leave
out 
the 
door 
to 
drive UnrelEv_library
back 
home 
. 
my 
daughter 
enjoyed+looking+at UnrelEv_library
the 
pictures 
and 
trying UnrelEv_library
a 
few 
of 
the 
animals 
herself 
. 
<end_of_story>_library 
this 
afternoon 
i 
went+to+the+library Evoking_library
. 
i 
needed UnrelEv_library
a 
really 
good 
book 
to 
read RelNScrEv_library
about 
dinosaurs 
. 
i 
walked+up ScrEv_other_library
to 
the 
reception 
desk 
and 
asked ScrEv_ask_librarian
the 
librarian 
where 
the 
dinosaur 
books 
could 
be 
found RelNScrEv_library
. 
she 
took RelNScrEv_library
me 
to 
the 
right 
area 
and 
i 
looked ScrEv_look_for_book
at 
all 
of 
the 
choices 
. 
there 
were UnrelEv_library
so 
many 
! 
i 
chose ScrEv_other_library
a 
few 
that 
i 
thought+looked UnrelEv_library
really 
interesting 
. 
i 
took ScrEv_take_book
the 
books 
i 
had 
chosen RelNScrEv_library
and 
walked+over ScrEv_go_check_out
to 
the 
self 
checkout 
area 
. 
i 
pulled+out ScrEv_show_card
my 
library 
card 
and 
scanned ScrEv_other_library
it 
with 
the 
scanning 
wand 
. 
i 
then 
used 
the 
wand 
to 
scan ScrEv_register
the 
bar 
code 
on 
each 
of 
the 
books 
. 
when 
they 
had 
all 
been 
scanned ScrEv_register
i 
checked ScrEv_other_library
the 
screen 
to 
make+sure UnrelEv_library
everything 
was UnrelEv_library
correct 
. 
i 
clicked UnrelEv_library
on 
the 
button 
to 
print ScrEv_get_receipt
my 
receipt 
. 
i 
put UnrelEv_library
the 
receipt 
inside 
one 
of 
the 
books 
, 
picked+up ScrEv_other_library
the 
books 
and 
went+out ScrEv_leave
the 
door 
. 
i 
could 
hardly 
wait UnrelEv_library
to 
get 
home 
and 
start UnrelEv_library
reading RelNScrEv_library
. 
<end_of_story>_library 
i 
was 
skimming UnrelEv_library
my 
nook 
for 
something 
good 
to 
read RelNScrEv_library
and 
found UnrelEv_library
that 
i 
had 
either 
read RelNScrEv_library
everything 
or 
that 
i 
was UnrelEv_library
not 
interested 
in 
what 
i 
had 
not 
read RelNScrEv_library
. 
so 
i 
decided UnrelEv_library
to 
go+to+the+local+library Evoking_library
and 
get RelNScrEv_library
one 
of 
the 
old 
fashioned 
paper 
books 
that 
i 
had 
not 
read RelNScrEv_library
. 
i 
went ScrEv_get_library
and 
looked ScrEv_look_for_book
around 
the 
shelves 
and 
talked+to ScrEv_ask_librarian
the 
librarian 
and 
other 
customers 
about 
what 
was UnrelEv_library
good 
to 
read RelNScrEv_library
. 
after 
picking+up ScrEv_take_book
a 
few 
and 
reading RelNScrEv_library
the 
summary 
i 
finally 
found ScrEv_other_library
one 
of 
interest 
and 
took ScrEv_take_book
it 
to 
the 
checkout 
line 
. 
while 
checking+out ScrEv_register
the 
book 
the 
librarian 
noticed UnrelEv_library
the 
handgun 
on 
my 
hip 
and 
we 
had UnrelEv_library
a 
great 
conversation 
about 
the 
importance 
of 
being UnrelEv_library
ready 
, 
willing 
, 
and 
able 
to 
protect UnrelEv_library
yourself 
in 
any 
situation 
and 
in 
any 
locality 
. 
she 
said UnrelEv_library
she 
was 
grateful 
to 
live UnrelEv_library
in 
a 
nation 
where 
we 
had UnrelEv_library
that 
right 
and 
i 
heartily 
agreed UnrelEv_library
with 
her 
. 
<end_of_story>_library 
i 
went+to+the+library+to+find+books Evoking_library
about 
making UnrelEv_library
a 
set 
of 
wooden 
shelves 
. 
i 
asked ScrEv_ask_librarian
the 
librarian 
for 
help 
and 
she 
pointed RelNScrEv_library
me 
towards 
the 
right 
section 
. 
i 
looked ScrEv_look_for_book
at 
all 
the 
books 
on 
woodworking 
until 
i 
found ScrEv_other_library
a 
few 
that 
i 
felt+had UnrelEv_library
the 
information 
i 
needed UnrelEv_library
to 
build UnrelEv_library
the 
shelves 
. 
i 
took ScrEv_take_book
the 
books 
that 
i 
needed UnrelEv_library
to 
the 
librarian 
and 
she 
told UnrelEv_library
me 
that 
they 
now 
have UnrelEv_library
a 
self-checkout 
. 
she 
showed ScrEv_other_library
me 
how 
the 
system 
worked UnrelEv_library
and 
assigned RelNScrEv_library
me 
a 
pin 
code 
. 
they 
gave ScrEv_obtain_card
me 
a 
new 
library 
card 
that 
will 
let UnrelEv_library
me 
use UnrelEv_library
the 
self 
check 
out 
. 
so 
i 
scanned ScrEv_other_library
my 
library 
card 
and 
put+in ScrEv_other_library
my 
pass 
code 
. 
i 
scanned ScrEv_register
each 
of 
the 
books 
i 
had 
chosen RelNScrEv_library
and 
then 
clicked UnrelEv_library
on 
the 
button 
to 
print ScrEv_other_library
my 
receipt 
. 
this 
new 
system 
will 
make UnrelEv_library
going+to+the+library Evoking_library
much 
faster 
. 
i 
gathered ScrEv_other_library
my 
books 
and 
left ScrEv_leave
the 
library 
and 
went+home UnrelEv_library
to 
start UnrelEv_library
my 
book 
shelves 
. 
<end_of_story>_library 
eliminating 
boredom 
by 
the 
book 
i 
had UnrelEv_library
the 
day 
off 
work 
. 
i 
was UnrelEv_library
glad 
of 
that 
but 
only 
a 
few 
hours 
into 
my 
day 
, 
i 
realized UnrelEv_library
how 
bored UnrelEv_library
i 
was 
. 
i 
had 
already 
cleaned UnrelEv_library
my 
house 
and 
done UnrelEv_library
everything 
i 
needed 
to 
do UnrelEv_library
. 
i 
turned UnrelEv_library
on 
the 
television 
, 
but 
i 
could 
n't 
find UnrelEv_library
anything 
to 
watch UnrelEv_library
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_library
cloudy 
and 
rainy 
outside 
, 
so 
going UnrelEv_library
outside 
was UnrelEv_library
not 
the 
best 
option 
. 
i 
knew UnrelEv_library
i 
needed 
to 
find UnrelEv_library
something 
to 
do UnrelEv_library
though 
and 
i 
thought UnrelEv_library
that 
maybe 
it 
would 
be UnrelEv_library
a 
great 
idea 
to 
find RelNScrEv_library
a 
new 
book 
to 
read RelNScrEv_library
. 
i 
decided UnrelEv_library
to 
drive+to+the+local+library Evoking_library
. 
i 
looked ScrEv_browse_releases
at 
all 
of 
the 
new 
books 
that 
they 
had UnrelEv_library
on 
display 
. 
i 
found ScrEv_other_library
a 
book 
that 
really 
caught UnrelEv_library
my 
eye 
and 
looked UnrelEv_library
intriguing 
. 
i 
knew UnrelEv_library
that 
i 
really 
wanted UnrelEv_library
to 
read RelNScrEv_library
this 
book 
so 
i 
checked ScrEv_register
it 
out 
. 
i 
went ScrEv_leave
home 
and 
started UnrelEv_library
reading RelNScrEv_library
. 
the 
book 
was UnrelEv_library
so 
interesting 
that 
i 
read RelNScrEv_library
and 
read RelNScrEv_library
and 
forgot UnrelEv_library
what 
time 
it 
was UnrelEv_library
. 
i 
was UnrelEv_library
almost 
to 
the 
end 
of 
the 
book 
when 
i 
noticed UnrelEv_library
it 
was UnrelEv_library
already 
dark 
outside 
. 
i 
was 
amazed UnrelEv_library
at 
how 
fast 
time 
had 
gone UnrelEv_library
due 
to 
being 
caught+up UnrelEv_library
in 
a 
very 
interesting 
book 
. 
going+to+the+library+to+borrow+a+book Evoking_library
had 
been UnrelEv_library
a 
very 
great 
idea 
to 
cure UnrelEv_library
my 
boredom 
. 
<end_of_story>_library 
the 
other 
day 
, 
i 
finished UnrelEv_library
reading RelNScrEv_library
the 
fourth 
book 
of 
the 
game 
of 
thrones 
series 
. 
with 
the 
new 
season 
about 
to 
start UnrelEv_library
on 
hbo 
, 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_library
to 
get+ahead UnrelEv_library
of 
the 
show 
and 
continue UnrelEv_library
reading RelNScrEv_library
the 
books 
in 
the 
series 
-- 
but 
i 
did 
not 
want UnrelEv_library
to 
pay UnrelEv_library
for 
the 
next 
book 
. 
remembering UnrelEv_library
that 
i 
had UnrelEv_library
a 
library 
card 
somewhere 
in 
my 
desk 
at 
home 
, 
i 
went UnrelEv_library
home 
and 
found UnrelEv_library
it 
. 
i 
went+to+the+library Evoking_library
and 
after 
browsing ScrEv_look_for_book
the 
fiction 
section 
, 
i 
finally 
found ScrEv_other_library
the 
fifth 
book 
in 
the 
series 
and 
brought ScrEv_take_book
it 
to 
the 
check 
out 
desk 
of 
the 
library 
. 
i 
handed ScrEv_show_card
over 
my 
information 
and 
library 
card 
and 
checked ScrEv_register
out 
the 
book 
, 
getting UnrelEv_library
two 
weeks 
to 
read RelNScrEv_library
it 
for 
free 
. 
i 
'm UnrelEv_library
now 
a 
quarter 
of 
the 
way 
through 
the 
book 
and 
enjoy UnrelEv_library
every 
page 
of 
it 
while 
loving UnrelEv_library
the 
fact 
that 
my 
taxes 
paid UnrelEv_library
for 
me 
to 
read RelNScrEv_library
this 
and 
i 
had 
to 
pay UnrelEv_library
no 
extra 
money 
. 
<end_of_story>_library 
yesterday 
i 
went+to+the+library Evoking_library
to 
look ScrEv_look_for_book
at 
some 
books 
. 
my 
favorite 
type 
of 
books 
are UnrelEv_library
books 
about 
animals 
. 
i 
love UnrelEv_library
cats 
and 
wolves 
and 
many 
other 
fantastic 
creatures 
. 
my 
dad 
dropped ScrEv_get_library
me 
off 
at 
the 
library 
at 
3:00 
pm 
. 
i 
asked ScrEv_ask_librarian
the 
librarian 
at 
the 
desk 
where 
i 
could 
find RelNScrEv_library
some 
books 
on 
animals 
. 
she 
directed RelNScrEv_library
me 
to 
a 
large 
shelf 
in 
the 
back 
. 
i 
started UnrelEv_library
to 
look UnrelEv_library
at 
the 
books 
and 
found ScrEv_other_library
one 
on 
wolves 
and 
another 
on 
leopards 
. 
i 
took ScrEv_take_book
the 
books 
off 
the 
shelf 
and 
sat+down UnrelEv_library
at 
a 
table 
. 
i 
started UnrelEv_library
reading RelNScrEv_library
them 
and 
was UnrelEv_library
so 
into 
them 
that 
i 
lost UnrelEv_library
track 
of 
time 
. 
soon 
it 
was UnrelEv_library
6:00 
pm 
and 
my 
father 
was 
waiting UnrelEv_library
outside 
to 
pick UnrelEv_library
me 
up 
. 
i 
took ScrEv_take_book
both 
books 
to 
the 
front 
desk 
and 
had UnrelEv_library
the 
librarian 
check ScrEv_register
them 
out 
for 
me 
. 
i 
was UnrelEv_library
so 
excited 
to 
continue UnrelEv_library
reading RelNScrEv_library
them 
and 
i 
went ScrEv_leave
outside 
and 
we 
drove UnrelEv_library
home 
. 
<end_of_story>_library 
i 
needed UnrelEv_library
to 
write UnrelEv_library
a 
school 
report 
on 
tigers 
, 
and 
i 
decided UnrelEv_library
to 
visit+the+library Evoking_library
to 
find RelNScrEv_library
a 
book 
to 
use UnrelEv_library
in 
my 
research 
. 
when 
i 
entered ScrEv_other_library
the 
library 
, 
i 
saw UnrelEv_library
hundreds 
of 
books 
on 
many 
different 
shelves 
and 
was UnrelEv_library
not 
sure 
where 
to 
find RelNScrEv_library
books 
on 
tigers 
. 
i 
asked ScrEv_ask_librarian
a 
librarian 
for 
help 
finding RelNScrEv_library
books 
on 
tigers 
. 
are 
you 
looking+for UnrelEv_library
stories 
about 
tigers 
, 
or 
facts 
and 
photographs 
about 
tigers 
? 
she 
asked UnrelEv_library
me 
. 
i 
told UnrelEv_library
her 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_library
facts 
and 
real 
information 
so 
i 
can 
write UnrelEv_library
a 
report 
. 
she 
walked+over UnrelEv_library
to 
a 
group 
of 
shelves 
labeled RelNScrEv_library
nonfiction 
and 
told UnrelEv_library
me 
that 
these 
books 
all 
had UnrelEv_library
true 
facts 
and 
pictures 
, 
rather 
than 
being UnrelEv_library
imaginary 
stories 
. 
they 
are 
put RelNScrEv_library
in 
a 
special 
order 
using UnrelEv_library
number 
codes 
called 
the 
dewey 
decimal 
system 
. 
using UnrelEv_library
these 
codes 
, 
all 
the 
books 
on 
tigers 
would 
be UnrelEv_library
in 
the 
same 
place 
and 
would 
be UnrelEv_library
very 
close 
to 
books 
about 
other 
animals 
. 
she 
looked+up RelNScrEv_library
the 
dewey 
decimal 
system 
code 
for 
tigers 
and 
wrote ScrEv_note_shelf
it 
down 
for 
me 
. 
walking+through ScrEv_look_for_book
the 
shelves 
with 
my 
code 
, 
i 
saw UnrelEv_library
that 
the 
numbers 
on 
the 
spines 
of 
the 
books 
start UnrelEv_library
at 
zero 
and 
keep+getting UnrelEv_library
bigger 
and 
bigger 
. 
finally 
, 
i 
was 
getting UnrelEv_library
close 
to 
the 
number 
she 
wrote RelNScrEv_library
down 
for 
me 
. 
there 
i 
saw UnrelEv_library
books 
about 
lions 
, 
cheetahs 
, 
and 
finally 
tigers 
. 
i 
found ScrEv_other_library
a 
book 
that 
looked UnrelEv_library
like 
it 
would 
be UnrelEv_library
helpful 
for 
my 
report 
and 
brought ScrEv_other_library
it 
back 
to 
the 
librarian 
. 
she 
asked RelNScrEv_library
me 
for 
my 
library 
card 
, 
and 
after 
i 
handed ScrEv_show_card
it 
to 
her 
, 
she 
scanned ScrEv_other_library
it 
with 
her 
computer 
. 
next 
, 
she 
scanned ScrEv_register
a 
barcode 
on 
the 
back 
of 
the 
book 
. 
now 
the 
book 
was 
checked+out ScrEv_register
in 
my 
name 
so 
that 
the 
library 
would 
know UnrelEv_library
who 
has UnrelEv_library
the 
book 
. 
she 
handed RelNScrEv_library
me 
the 
book 
and 
told UnrelEv_library
me 
that 
i 
needed UnrelEv_library
to 
bring ScrEv_return_book
it 
back 
to 
the 
library 
in 
two 
weeks 
. 
if 
i 
did 
n't 
bring ScrEv_return_book
it 
back 
, 
i 
would 
have 
to 
pay RelNScrEv_library
a 
fine 
for 
every 
day 
i 
kept UnrelEv_library
it 
, 
because 
other 
people 
might 
want 
to 
read RelNScrEv_library
the 
book 
too 
. 
i 
thanked RelNScrEv_library
her 
and 
went ScrEv_leave
home 
to 
work UnrelEv_library
on 
my 
report 
. 
<end_of_story>_library 
i 
visited+the+library Evoking_library
and 
asked ScrEv_ask_librarian
the 
main 
librarian 
where 
i 
could 
find RelNScrEv_library
the 
fiction 
books 
. 
i 
followed RelNScrEv_library
her 
instructions 
and 
then 
looked ScrEv_look_for_book
around 
the 
shelves 
for 
the 
mystery 
genre 
books 
. 
i 
browsed ScrEv_look_for_book
through 
the 
shelves 
of 
mystery 
books 
for 
a 
few 
minutes 
and 
picked ScrEv_take_book
out 
a 
few 
books 
that 
looked UnrelEv_library
interesting 
. 
then 
, 
i 
sat+down UnrelEv_library
in 
a 
comfy 
chair 
near 
the 
shelves 
and 
read RelNScrEv_library
the 
beginnings 
to 
the 
books 
i 
had 
chosen RelNScrEv_library
to 
see 
if 
i 
would 
really 
like UnrelEv_library
them 
. 
i 
narrowed UnrelEv_library
it 
down 
to 
one 
book 
that 
i 
found UnrelEv_library
interesting 
and 
enjoyable 
to 
read RelNScrEv_library
. 
i 
placed RelNScrEv_library
the 
other 
books 
on 
a 
shelf 
to 
be 
returned RelNScrEv_library
to 
their 
proper 
place 
by 
the 
librarian 
. 
i 
took ScrEv_take_book
the 
book 
and 
went UnrelEv_library
to 
the 
front 
of 
the 
library 
and 
pulled+out UnrelEv_library
my 
library 
card 
. 
i 
handed ScrEv_show_card
my 
library 
card 
and 
the 
book 
to 
the 
librarian 
and 
she 
scanned ScrEv_register
them 
both 
using 
her 
card 
scanner 
. 
she 
informed RelNScrEv_library
me 
of 
the 
due 
date 
of 
the 
book 
and 
i 
thanked RelNScrEv_library
her 
for 
her 
help 
. 
i 
left ScrEv_leave
the 
library 
to 
go UnrelEv_library
home 
. 
<end_of_story>_library 
this 
morning 
, 
i 
finished UnrelEv_library
reading RelNScrEv_library
the 
book 
i 
checked+out RelNScrEv_library
the 
week 
before 
. 
after 
breakfast 
, 
i 
went+to+the+library Evoking_library
with 
my 
partner 
. 
i 
dropped ScrEv_return_book
my 
book 
off 
in 
the 
return 
bin 
after 
we 
walked ScrEv_other_library
in 
. 
she 
wanted UnrelEv_library
to 
look+at UnrelEv_library
the 
section 
in 
the 
far 
back 
of 
the 
library 
, 
concerning UnrelEv_library
the 
history 
of 
wood 
furniture 
. 
i 
had UnrelEv_library
something 
special 
in 
mind 
. 
science 
fiction 
is UnrelEv_library
the 
genre 
i 
typically 
read RelNScrEv_library
, 
so 
i 
went UnrelEv_library
in 
that 
direction 
. 
i 
browsed ScrEv_look_for_book
the 
long 
aisles 
for 
my 
favorite 
author 
, 
and 
saw UnrelEv_library
that 
they 
had UnrelEv_library
two 
copies 
of 
the 
book 
i 
was 
wanting UnrelEv_library
to 
check+out RelNScrEv_library
. 
i 
left UnrelEv_library
quickly 
to 
the 
drinking 
fountain 
, 
and 
came+back UnrelEv_library
to 
find UnrelEv_library
that 
there 
was 
only 
one 
copy 
left UnrelEv_library
. 
i 
picked+up ScrEv_take_book
the 
book 
and 
went UnrelEv_library
to 
go+find UnrelEv_library
my 
partner 
, 
who 
had 
also 
found ScrEv_other_library
her 
book 
. 
the 
checkout 
line 
was UnrelEv_library
fast 
, 
we 
had UnrelEv_library
our 
library 
cards 
ready 
for 
the 
attendant 
and 
had UnrelEv_library
no 
issue 
checking+out ScrEv_register
the 
books 
. 
the 
drive 
home 
was 
relaxing UnrelEv_library
, 
and 
we 
began UnrelEv_library
reading RelNScrEv_library
right 
away 
after 
returning UnrelEv_library
to 
the 
living 
room 
. 
<end_of_story>_library 
today 
i 
decided UnrelEv_library
to 
go+to+the+library+and+borrow+a+book+to+read Evoking_library
. 
the 
library 
is UnrelEv_library
my 
local 
public 
library 
, 
and 
it 
is 
very 
big 
so 
there 
are 
many 
options 
to 
choose+from RelNScrEv_library
. 
when 
i 
arrived ScrEv_get_library
, 
i 
began+walking UnrelEv_library
up 
and 
down 
the 
aisles 
, 
reading RelNScrEv_library
the 
titles 
on 
the 
books 
and 
looking UnrelEv_library
at 
ones 
that 
had UnrelEv_library
titles 
that 
caught UnrelEv_library
my 
eye 
. 
i 
made UnrelEv_library
my 
way 
through 
the 
fiction 
section 
, 
as 
this 
is 
what 
i 
prefer UnrelEv_library
to 
read RelNScrEv_library
. 
i 
perused RelNScrEv_library
many 
genres 
, 
including UnrelEv_library
fantasy 
, 
horror 
, 
thriller 
, 
and 
mystery 
. 
i 
finally 
settled+on RelNScrEv_library
a 
book 
by 
stephen 
king 
- 
arguably 
one 
of 
the 
best 
horror 
writers 
of 
all-time 
. 
it 
was UnrelEv_library
a 
book 
i 
had 
read RelNScrEv_library
before 
, 
but 
i 
enjoyed UnrelEv_library
it 
enough 
to 
read RelNScrEv_library
again 
. 
after 
making RelNScrEv_library
my 
selection 
, 
i 
made ScrEv_go_check_out
my 
way 
to 
the 
self-scanner 
to 
check+out ScrEv_register
my 
book 
. 
i 
scanned ScrEv_other_library
my 
library 
card 
so 
that 
the 
book 
would 
be 
logged RelNScrEv_library
under 
my 
account 
, 
then 
i 
scanned ScrEv_register
the 
book 
itself 
. 
finally 
, 
i 
was UnrelEv_library
done 
! 
i 
left ScrEv_leave
the 
library 
and 
went UnrelEv_library
home 
to 
sit+down UnrelEv_library
and 
read RelNScrEv_library
. 
<end_of_story>_library 
borrowing+a+book+from+the+library Evoking_library
is UnrelEv_library
so 
nice 
and 
super 
simple 
to 
do UnrelEv_library
. 
i 
love+doing UnrelEv_library
this 
because 
if 
you 
want 
to 
read RelNScrEv_library
a 
book 
and 
not 
buy UnrelEv_library
it 
, 
then 
just 
go UnrelEv_library
borrow+it+from+the+library Evoking_library
. 
almost 
every 
library 
will 
add RelNScrEv_library
new 
books 
to 
their 
collection 
if 
you 
ask RelNScrEv_library
. 
you 
just 
need UnrelEv_library
a 
library 
card 
and 
you 
can 
get RelNScrEv_library
one 
from 
any 
library 
since 
they 
are UnrelEv_library
free 
if 
you 
have UnrelEv_library
a 
picture 
id 
card 
of 
yourself 
and 
an 
address 
where 
you 
reside UnrelEv_library
. 
if 
you 
know UnrelEv_library
what 
type 
of 
book 
you 
want UnrelEv_library
, 
you 
can 
go UnrelEv_library
to 
the 
section 
of 
the 
library 
that 
has UnrelEv_library
that 
category 
or 
you 
can 
ask ScrEv_ask_librarian
a 
librarian 
to 
help UnrelEv_library
you 
. 
if 
you 
ask ScrEv_ask_librarian
politely 
where 
a 
certain 
book 
is UnrelEv_library
, 
they 
are UnrelEv_library
more 
than 
happy 
to 
help RelNScrEv_library
you 
find RelNScrEv_library
the 
book 
. 
so 
once 
you 
find ScrEv_other_library
the 
book 
you 
are 
looking+for RelNScrEv_library
, 
you 
take ScrEv_take_book
it 
to 
the 
checkout 
desk 
and 
present ScrEv_show_card
them 
with 
your 
library 
card 
, 
then 
they 
punch RelNScrEv_library
the 
card 
into 
their 
computer 
system 
and 
scan ScrEv_register
the 
barcode 
on 
the 
book 
so 
they 
have UnrelEv_library
a 
record 
of 
who 
has UnrelEv_library
what 
book 
. 
they 
then 
tell RelNScrEv_library
you 
when 
the 
book 
is UnrelEv_library
due 
, 
and 
for 
the 
next 
designated UnrelEv_library
time 
frame 
, 
you 
can 
spend UnrelEv_library
your 
time 
enjoying UnrelEv_library
the 
book 
you 
are 
borrowing+from+the+library Evoking_library
. 
i 
go+to+the+library Evoking_library
just 
about 
every 
day 
and 
find RelNScrEv_library
a 
good 
book 
to 
read RelNScrEv_library
and 
i 
sit UnrelEv_library
outside 
and 
read RelNScrEv_library
it 
. 
i 
went ScrEv_get_library
and 
got RelNScrEv_library
the 
divergent 
book 
and 
started UnrelEv_library
reading RelNScrEv_library
it 
today 
in 
the 
library 
. 
i 
had 
to 
ask ScrEv_ask_librarian
the 
librarian 
where 
to 
find RelNScrEv_library
it 
in 
the 
library 
since 
it 
was UnrelEv_library
not 
where 
i 
thought UnrelEv_library
it 
would 
be UnrelEv_library
, 
she 
kindly 
helped RelNScrEv_library
me 
find RelNScrEv_library
it 
and 
asked RelNScrEv_library
what 
types 
of 
books 
that 
i 
enjoy UnrelEv_library
reading RelNScrEv_library
and 
suggested RelNScrEv_library
some 
for 
me 
to 
check+out RelNScrEv_library
after 
i 
finish UnrelEv_library
this 
one 
and 
then 
i 
went ScrEv_leave
on 
my 
way 
to 
dive UnrelEv_library
into 
this 
book 
and 
enjoy UnrelEv_library
the 
story 
since 
i 
saw UnrelEv_library
the 
movie 
last 
week 
. 
<end_of_story>_library 
for 
my 
english 
class 
, 
i 
had 
to 
read RelNScrEv_library
a 
book 
about 
president 
obama 
. 
normally 
, 
i 
am 
able 
to 
find UnrelEv_library
a 
pdf 
copy 
of 
a 
book 
online 
but 
i 
could 
n't 
find UnrelEv_library
this 
book 
. 
i 
had UnrelEv_library
no 
choice 
but 
to 
go+to+the+library Evoking_library
to 
take+out RelNScrEv_library
this 
book 
. 
while 
i 
was UnrelEv_library
at 
the 
library 
, 
i 
had 
to 
wait ScrEv_wait
on 
line 
to 
speak UnrelEv_library
to 
the 
librarian 
. 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_library
the 
librarian 
to 
help RelNScrEv_library
me 
find RelNScrEv_library
the 
book 
since 
the 
library 
was UnrelEv_library
a 
huge 
library 
. 
i 
would 
n't 
be 
able 
to 
find RelNScrEv_library
the 
book 
on 
my 
own 
. 
when 
i 
was 
finally 
able 
to 
speak ScrEv_ask_librarian
to 
the 
librarian 
about 
the 
book 
, 
she 
was UnrelEv_library
very 
warm 
and 
helpful 
. 
not 
only 
did 
she 
tell RelNScrEv_library
me 
where 
the 
book 
was 
at 
but 
she 
personally 
walked RelNScrEv_library
with 
me 
to 
the 
area 
. 
on 
the 
way 
, 
she 
made UnrelEv_library
small 
talk 
and 
asked UnrelEv_library
why 
am 
i 
reading RelNScrEv_library
the 
book 
? 
i 
told UnrelEv_library
her 
it 
was UnrelEv_library
for 
an 
english 
class 
. 
a 
minute 
later 
, 
we 
came UnrelEv_library
to 
the 
area 
where 
the 
book 
was 
located UnrelEv_library
. 
she 
picked+up ScrEv_take_book
the 
book 
and 
handed UnrelEv_library
it 
to 
me 
. 
soon 
, 
she 
helped UnrelEv_library
me 
check+out ScrEv_register
the 
book 
. 
finally 
, 
i 
had UnrelEv_library
the 
book 
and 
i 
left ScrEv_leave
the 
library 
. 
<end_of_story>_library 
the 
library 
is UnrelEv_library
a 
magical 
place 
where 
dreams 
are 
made UnrelEv_library
real 
and 
fantasies 
are 
explored UnrelEv_library
. 
as 
i 
walk+through UnrelEv_library
the 
aisles 
and 
aisles 
of 
books 
i 
ca 
n't 
imagine UnrelEv_library
what 
to 
choose RelNScrEv_library
. 
there 
are UnrelEv_library
so 
many 
that 
my 
mind 
ca 
n't 
keep+up UnrelEv_library
. 
i 
love UnrelEv_library
to 
read RelNScrEv_library
and 
i 
do UnrelEv_library
it 
daily 
. 
it 
is UnrelEv_library
my 
favorite 
hobby 
and 
i 
spend UnrelEv_library
a 
majority 
of 
my 
time 
either 
at 
home 
reading RelNScrEv_library
or 
at 
the 
library 
finding RelNScrEv_library
new 
books 
to 
read RelNScrEv_library
. 
the 
best 
part 
about 
the 
library 
is UnrelEv_library
not 
having 
to 
buy UnrelEv_library
the 
books 
or 
spend UnrelEv_library
money 
. 
you 
simple 
give ScrEv_show_card
them 
your 
card 
and 
they 
let UnrelEv_library
you 
take ScrEv_take_book
the 
book 
home 
for 
a 
long 
enough 
period 
to 
read RelNScrEv_library
and 
bring ScrEv_return_book
back 
. 
if 
the 
book 
is 
too 
long 
to 
read RelNScrEv_library
then 
you 
can 
simply 
check ScrEv_register
it 
out 
again 
and 
bring ScrEv_return_book
it 
back 
when 
you 
are 
finished UnrelEv_library
. 
as 
long 
i 
keep UnrelEv_library
a 
good 
standing 
with 
the 
library 
i 
can 
keep+doing UnrelEv_library
this 
all 
my 
life 
! 
<end_of_story>_library 
my 
history 
teacher 
have UnrelEv_library
us 
an 
assignment 
to 
do UnrelEv_library
a 
research 
paper 
on 
world 
war 
ii 
. 
i 
needed 
to 
gather UnrelEv_library
information 
so 
i 
headed ScrEv_get_library
to 
the 
school 
library 
to 
do UnrelEv_library
research 
. 
i 
found RelNScrEv_library
many 
helpful 
books 
in 
the 
history 
section 
of 
the 
library 
and 
sat+down UnrelEv_library
to 
do UnrelEv_library
my 
research 
. 
a 
few 
hours 
later 
and 
the 
library 
is UnrelEv_library
about 
to 
close 
but 
i 
'm UnrelEv_library
not 
finished 
with 
my 
work 
so 
i 
decided UnrelEv_library
to 
borrow+the+history+books Evoking_library
. 
i 
gathered ScrEv_take_book
the 
books 
and 
headed ScrEv_go_check_out
to 
the 
librarian 
. 
i 
handed ScrEv_other_library
her 
the 
books 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_library
to 
borrow Evoking_library
along 
with 
my 
library 
card 
. 
she 
then 
scans ScrEv_register
my 
library 
card 
and 
each 
book 
. 
the 
machine 
starts UnrelEv_library
printing RelNScrEv_library
out 
the 
date 
of 
when 
the 
books 
are 
due 
. 
the 
librarian 
hands ScrEv_other_library
me 
back 
the 
books 
, 
library 
card 
, 
and 
due 
date 
. 
i 
take RelNScrEv_library
the 
books 
home 
to 
do UnrelEv_library
further 
research 
for 
my 
history 
assignment 
that 
's 
due 
next 
week 
. 
<end_of_story>_library 
today 
, 
we 
went+to+the+library+to+check+out+some+books Evoking_library
. 
a 
lot 
of 
people 
lke UnrelEv_library
to 
borrow+books Evoking_library
from 
the 
library 
for 
all 
kinds 
of 
reasons 
but 
we 
just 
wanted UnrelEv_library
some 
books 
to 
read RelNScrEv_library
for 
fun 
. 
we 
already 
knew UnrelEv_library
which 
books 
we 
wanted UnrelEv_library
before 
we 
got ScrEv_get_library
to 
the 
library 
so 
when 
we 
got ScrEv_get_library
there 
, 
we 
just 
had 
to 
find RelNScrEv_library
them 
. 
it 
is UnrelEv_library
possible 
to 
look UnrelEv_library
them 
up 
and 
find RelNScrEv_library
them 
on 
the 
libary 
's 
computer 
. 
if 
you 
are UnrelEv_library
in 
a 
hurry 
, 
you 
can 
ask ScrEv_ask_librarian
the 
librarian 
to 
help UnrelEv_library
you 
find RelNScrEv_library
them 
a 
little 
easier 
and 
more 
quickly 
. 
when 
we 
found+out UnrelEv_library
where 
to 
find RelNScrEv_library
the 
ones 
we 
wanted UnrelEv_library
, 
we 
found RelNScrEv_library
them 
and 
took ScrEv_take_book
them 
to 
the 
librarian 
to 
check ScrEv_register
them 
out 
to 
us 
. 
she 
put ScrEv_register
the 
book 
information 
in 
the 
computer 
and 
then 
she 
swiped ScrEv_other_library
our 
library 
cards 
. 
it 
did 
n't 
take UnrelEv_library
very 
long 
at 
all 
. 
when 
shed 
put ScrEv_register
them 
into 
the 
system 
and 
swiped ScrEv_other_library
the 
cards 
, 
she 
printed ScrEv_other_library
out 
a 
slip 
of 
paper 
that 
showed UnrelEv_library
exactly 
what 
day 
we 
needed UnrelEv_library
to 
turn RelNScrEv_library
them 
back 
in 
, 
in 
order 
to 
avoid UnrelEv_library
any 
late 
fees 
. 
when 
we 
were UnrelEv_library
ready 
to 
take RelNScrEv_library
them 
back 
, 
we 
turned ScrEv_return_book
them 
in 
to 
the 
librarian 
and 
then 
looked ScrEv_look_for_book
for 
more 
! 
<end_of_story>_library 
i 
go+to+the+library Evoking_library
very 
often 
and 
am 
always 
borrowing+books Evoking_library
. 
when 
i 
decide UnrelEv_library
to 
go RelNScrEv_library
, 
i 
take RelNScrEv_library
any 
books 
with 
me 
that 
i 
have 
read RelNScrEv_library
and 
need 
to 
return RelNScrEv_library
. 
once 
i 
get ScrEv_get_library
to 
the 
library 
, 
i 
will 
walk+in ScrEv_other_library
and 
put ScrEv_return_book
any 
books 
in 
the 
return 
slot 
that 
i 
have 
brought+back RelNScrEv_library
. 
i 
will 
then 
go UnrelEv_library
to 
the 
section 
where 
they 
put UnrelEv_library
all 
the 
new 
releases 
of 
books 
and 
see ScrEv_browse_releases
if 
there 
are UnrelEv_library
any 
that 
i 
am UnrelEv_library
meaning 
to 
read RelNScrEv_library
. 
i 
also 
check+out ScrEv_browse_releases
my 
two 
favorite 
sections 
of 
the 
library 
and 
grab ScrEv_take_book
a 
couple 
of 
the 
books 
that 
i 
have 
been UnrelEv_library
meaning 
to 
read RelNScrEv_library
or 
that 
are UnrelEv_library
the 
next 
in 
a 
series 
. 
when 
i 
'm UnrelEv_library
ready 
to 
borrow+the+books Evoking_library
, 
i 
head+up ScrEv_go_check_out
to 
the 
main 
desk 
and 
wait ScrEv_wait
in 
line 
. 
when 
it 
is UnrelEv_library
my 
turn 
, 
i 
place ScrEv_other_library
the 
books 
on 
the 
counter 
for 
the 
person 
to 
scan ScrEv_register
. 
i 
also 
have 
to 
give ScrEv_show_card
them 
my 
library 
card 
so 
that 
they 
can 
keep UnrelEv_library
track 
of 
who 
is 
borrowing Evoking_library
the 
books 
. 
they 
scan ScrEv_other_library
my 
card 
, 
and 
then 
print+out ScrEv_other_library
a 
receipt 
that 
shows UnrelEv_library
when 
my 
books 
will 
each 
be UnrelEv_library
due 
. 
they 
put UnrelEv_library
the 
receipt 
inside 
one 
of 
the 
books 
so 
that 
i 
wo 
n't 
lose UnrelEv_library
it 
, 
and 
after 
i 
thank RelNScrEv_library
them 
for 
their 
help 
, 
i 
head UnrelEv_library
home 
to 
begin UnrelEv_library
reading RelNScrEv_library
my 
new 
books 
. 
<end_of_story>_library 
i 
love UnrelEv_library
going+to+the+library+to+check+out+books Evoking_library
. 
it 
is UnrelEv_library
probably 
one 
of 
my 
favorite 
places 
to 
go UnrelEv_library
to 
, 
since 
i 
'm UnrelEv_library
a 
fairly 
avid 
reader 
. 
anyway 
, 
i 
'll 
usually 
bike ScrEv_get_library
to 
the 
library 
and 
bring UnrelEv_library
a 
backpack 
with 
me 
so 
that 
i 
can 
easily 
bring RelNScrEv_library
my 
books 
home 
. 
the 
last 
time 
i 
went UnrelEv_library
, 
i 
was 
looking+for UnrelEv_library
some 
books 
on 
local 
folklore 
for 
a 
class 
that 
i 
'm 
taking UnrelEv_library
. 
i 
quickly 
went UnrelEv_library
to 
one 
of 
the 
computer 
search 
stations 
and 
typed+in ScrEv_use_computer
the 
last 
name 
of 
an 
author 
that 
i 
knew UnrelEv_library
had 
written UnrelEv_library
a 
book 
on 
the 
subject 
. 
i 
got+back UnrelEv_library
a 
couple 
more 
results 
than 
i 
had 
expected UnrelEv_library
, 
so 
i 
made ScrEv_note_shelf
note 
of 
them 
. 
then 
, 
i 
searched ScrEv_use_computer
by 
just 
the 
topic 
of 
folklore 
, 
along 
with 
the 
tribe 
that 
i 
was 
covering UnrelEv_library
. 
i 
found RelNScrEv_library
several 
books 
that 
looked UnrelEv_library
like 
they 
might 
be UnrelEv_library
interesting 
. 
so 
, 
i 
took ScrEv_note_shelf
the 
numbers 
for 
where 
they 
would 
be 
and 
headed+off UnrelEv_library
towards 
the 
stacks 
. 
i 
followed UnrelEv_library
the 
numbers 
to 
the 
different 
rows 
and 
picked+up ScrEv_take_book
the 
books 
that 
i 
needed UnrelEv_library
, 
as 
well 
as 
a 
couple 
other 
books 
that 
also 
sounded UnrelEv_library
interesting 
. 
my 
arms 
full 
, 
i 
took ScrEv_go_check_out
them 
all 
to 
the 
checkout 
counter 
, 
where 
a 
nice 
older 
man 
scanned ScrEv_register
them 
and 
gave ScrEv_other_library
me 
a 
printed UnrelEv_library
receipt 
that 
said UnrelEv_library
when 
i 
would 
need 
to 
have UnrelEv_library
them 
back 
by 
. 
all 
in 
all 
, 
it 
was UnrelEv_library
a 
pretty 
productive 
trip 
to 
the 
library 
. 
<end_of_story>_library 
the 
other 
day 
i 
decided UnrelEv_library
that 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_library
to 
read RelNScrEv_library
a 
book 
, 
but 
all 
the 
ones 
i 
had UnrelEv_library
in 
my 
home 
i 
had 
read RelNScrEv_library
already 
. 
when 
i 
was 
thinking UnrelEv_library
about 
what 
to 
do 
, 
i 
spotted UnrelEv_library
my 
library 
card 
and 
decided UnrelEv_library
that 
i 
'd 
go UnrelEv_library
borrow+a+book Evoking_library
. 
i 
drove+over ScrEv_get_library
and 
headed ScrEv_other_library
inside 
. 
i 
've 
always 
liked UnrelEv_library
libraries 
, 
they 
're UnrelEv_library
usually 
nice 
and 
quiet 
and 
you 
never 
know UnrelEv_library
what 
kind 
of 
interesting 
books 
you 
might 
find RelNScrEv_library
when 
you 
're 
looking+around UnrelEv_library
. 
i 
started UnrelEv_library
by 
looking ScrEv_browse_releases
at 
the 
new 
arrival 
shelves 
, 
but 
nothing 
there 
really 
caught UnrelEv_library
my 
eye 
. 
i 
headed+over UnrelEv_library
to 
one 
of 
the 
library 
computers 
and 
brought+up ScrEv_use_computer
the 
book 
search 
. 
it 
took UnrelEv_library
me 
a 
little 
while 
to 
decide UnrelEv_library
what 
kind 
of 
book 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_library
, 
but 
eventually 
decided UnrelEv_library
i 
wanted UnrelEv_library
a 
science 
fiction 
book 
, 
just 
something 
to 
enjoy UnrelEv_library
for 
a 
little 
while 
. 
i 
started UnrelEv_library
browsing ScrEv_use_computer
through 
all 
the 
search 
results 
until 
a 
book 
caught UnrelEv_library
my 
eye 
. 
i 
noted+down ScrEv_note_shelf
the 
shelf 
number 
it 
should 
be UnrelEv_library
in 
and 
went+over ScrEv_other_library
to 
it 
. 
i 
found RelNScrEv_library
my 
book 
and 
took ScrEv_take_book
it 
to 
the 
desk 
, 
where 
i 
gave ScrEv_show_card
the 
librarian 
my 
library 
card 
and 
the 
book 
. 
he 
checked ScrEv_register
it 
out 
for 
me 
and 
handed ScrEv_other_library
them 
back 
. 
after 
that 
, 
i 
headed ScrEv_leave
home 
and 
sat+down UnrelEv_library
to 
read RelNScrEv_library
my 
book 
. 
<end_of_story>_library 
a 
library 
is UnrelEv_library
a 
great 
way 
to 
re-live UnrelEv_library
the 
past 
. 
it 
's UnrelEv_library
a 
magical 
place 
where 
you 
can 
rent+a+book Evoking_library
, 
and 
return RelNScrEv_library
it 
at 
a 
leisurely 
pace 
. 
now-a-days 
there 
are UnrelEv_library
many 
digital 
options 
so 
the 
library 
has 
become UnrelEv_library
all 
but 
extinct 
. 
on 
the 
plus 
side 
they 
may 
have UnrelEv_library
some 
very 
rare 
finds 
that 
you 
can 
review RelNScrEv_library
. 
in 
order 
to 
borrow+a+book+from+the+library Evoking_library
, 
head ScrEv_get_library
to 
your 
local 
one 
and 
start UnrelEv_library
browsing RelNScrEv_library
their 
selection 
. 
you 
can 
read RelNScrEv_library
the 
back 
of 
these 
books 
for 
a 
summary 
on 
the 
topics 
covered UnrelEv_library
in 
the 
book 
. 
once 
you 
have 
selected ScrEv_other_library
a 
book 
or 
two 
, 
locate ScrEv_go_check_out
your 
closest 
librarian 
desk 
and 
bring ScrEv_go_check_out
the 
books 
over 
. 
they 
will 
allow UnrelEv_library
you 
to 
register ScrEv_register
and 
sign+out ScrEv_register
these 
books 
, 
due 
back 
at 
another 
time 
. 
take RelNScrEv_library
them 
home 
and 
make+sure UnrelEv_library
to 
enjoy UnrelEv_library
them 
by 
a 
fireplace 
, 
or 
with 
a 
small 
lit UnrelEv_library
candle 
. 
once 
you 
have 
completed UnrelEv_library
these 
books 
, 
or 
grown UnrelEv_library
tired 
of 
them 
, 
you 
can 
head+back ScrEv_get_library
to 
the 
library 
to 
return ScrEv_return_book
them 
. 
<end_of_story>_library 
last 
week 
i 
went+to+the+library+to+get+a+book Evoking_library
. 
one 
of 
my 
friends 
had 
recommended UnrelEv_library
that 
i 
read RelNScrEv_library
a 
book 
called UnrelEv_library
the 
chocolate 
wars 
. 
i 
went ScrEv_get_library
to 
the 
library 
saturday 
afternoon 
. 
i 
walked+into UnrelEv_library
the 
main 
area 
on 
the 
first 
floor 
and 
went UnrelEv_library
to 
a 
computer 
terminal 
, 
where 
i 
looked+up ScrEv_use_computer
the 
book 
by 
its 
title 
. 
the 
library 
catalog 
gave UnrelEv_library
me 
a 
call 
number 
that 
identified UnrelEv_library
where 
the 
book 
was 
stored RelNScrEv_library
. 
i 
wrote ScrEv_note_shelf
the 
call 
number 
down 
on 
a 
little 
slip 
of 
paper 
, 
then 
i 
took UnrelEv_library
the 
slip 
of 
paper 
and 
went ScrEv_other_library
to 
the 
shelves 
where 
the 
books 
are UnrelEv_library
. 
at 
the 
end 
of 
each 
row 
of 
book 
shelves 
, 
there 
are UnrelEv_library
signs 
that 
told UnrelEv_library
me 
which 
books 
were UnrelEv_library
in 
that 
row 
. 
i 
found ScrEv_other_library
the 
row 
where 
the 
number 
i 
was 
looking+for+was UnrelEv_library
, 
then 
i 
looked+at UnrelEv_library
the 
numbers 
on 
the 
books 
on 
those 
shelves 
until 
i 
found ScrEv_other_library
the 
number 
that 
matched UnrelEv_library
the 
chocolate 
wars 
. 
i 
pulled ScrEv_take_book
the 
book 
off 
the 
shelf 
and 
liked UnrelEv_library
the 
cover 
, 
so 
i 
decided UnrelEv_library
i 
would 
go+ahead UnrelEv_library
and 
read RelNScrEv_library
it 
as 
my 
friend 
suggested UnrelEv_library
. 
i 
took ScrEv_go_check_out
the 
book 
to 
the 
circulation 
desk 
and 
gave ScrEv_other_library
it 
to 
the 
librarian 
with 
my 
library 
card 
. 
the 
librarian 
swiped ScrEv_other_library
my 
library 
card 
through 
an 
electronic 
reader 
and 
told RelNScrEv_library
me 
the 
book 
would 
be UnrelEv_library
due 
in 
two 
weeks 
. 
i 
thanked RelNScrEv_library
her 
and 
left ScrEv_leave
the 
library 
. 
<end_of_story>_library 
reading RelNScrEv_library
is UnrelEv_library
very 
important 
to 
me 
, 
and 
with 
the 
amount 
that 
i 
read RelNScrEv_library
, 
it 
is UnrelEv_library
economical 
to 
use+a+library Evoking_library
to 
borrow Evoking_library
the 
books 
i 
would 
like 
to 
read RelNScrEv_library
. 
when 
borrowing Evoking_library
a 
book 
, 
i 
get UnrelEv_library
my 
son 
into 
the 
car 
and 
we 
drive ScrEv_get_library
to 
the 
library 
. 
usually 
we 
find ScrEv_look_for_book
a 
few 
books 
for 
him 
to 
borrow ScrEv_take_book
as 
well 
, 
so 
we 
go ScrEv_get_shelf
to 
the 
children 
's 
section 
first 
and 
pick+out ScrEv_take_book
two 
or 
three 
books 
for 
him 
. 
that 
way 
, 
when 
we 
go ScrEv_get_shelf
to 
find ScrEv_look_for_book
a 
book 
for 
me 
, 
he 
has UnrelEv_library
something 
to 
entertain UnrelEv_library
him 
. 
then 
we 
go ScrEv_get_shelf
to 
the 
fiction 
section 
for 
adults 
. 
usually 
my 
son 
ryan 
will 
sit UnrelEv_library
on 
the 
floor 
looking RelNScrEv_library
at 
his 
books 
next 
to 
me 
while 
i 
find ScrEv_look_for_book
book 
to 
check+out ScrEv_register
. 
i 
find ScrEv_look_for_book
a 
book 
or 
two 
and 
then 
ryan 
and 
i 
go ScrEv_go_check_out
to 
the 
check 
out 
and 
use ScrEv_show_card
my 
library 
card 
to 
check+out ScrEv_register
the 
books 
. 
the 
librarian 
usually 
puts ScrEv_other_library
them 
in 
a 
bag 
and 
then 
we 
leave ScrEv_leave
the 
library 
to 
go UnrelEv_library
home 
and 
enjoy UnrelEv_library
our 
books 
. 
<end_of_story>_library 
a 
while 
back 
i 
realized UnrelEv_library
i 
needed UnrelEv_library
some 
instructional 
material 
for 
a 
project 
i 
was 
working UnrelEv_library
on 
, 
and 
searching UnrelEv_library
for 
information 
on 
the 
internet 
was 
n't 
yielding UnrelEv_library
the 
results 
i 
desired UnrelEv_library
. 
i 
thought UnrelEv_library
about 
other 
sources 
of 
information 
and 
realized UnrelEv_library
that 
the 
library+would+probably+have+a+book Evoking_library
pertaining UnrelEv_library
to 
what 
i 
needed UnrelEv_library
. 
so 
i 
got UnrelEv_library
in 
my 
car 
and 
set+off ScrEv_get_library
for 
the 
library 
. 
once 
i 
got ScrEv_get_library
there 
, 
i 
signed+up ScrEv_obtain_card
for 
a 
library 
card 
since 
i 
knew UnrelEv_library
i 
'd 
need UnrelEv_library
that 
to 
be 
able UnrelEv_library
to 
borrow ScrEv_take_book
a 
book 
. 
i 
then 
went UnrelEv_library
to 
one 
of 
the 
reference 
computers 
and 
searched ScrEv_use_computer
for 
the 
book 
i 
was 
looking+for ScrEv_look_for_book
. 
i 
found ScrEv_note_shelf
the 
dewey 
decimal 
code 
for 
the 
book 
i 
wanted ScrEv_look_for_book
, 
and 
set+off ScrEv_get_shelf
through 
the 
aisles 
. 
finally 
, 
i 
found ScrEv_get_shelf
the 
aisle 
i 
was 
looking+for UnrelEv_library
. 
it 
only 
took UnrelEv_library
me 
a 
moment 
from 
there 
to 
find ScrEv_take_book
the 
book 
i 
wanted ScrEv_look_for_book
. 
book 
in 
hand 
, 
i 
went ScrEv_go_check_out
back 
to 
the 
library 
counter 
. 
i 
told UnrelEv_library
the 
librarian 
i 
'd 
like 
to 
borrow ScrEv_register
the 
book 
. 
she 
wrote ScrEv_register
my 
information 
down 
and 
on 
the 
insert 
in 
the 
book 
, 
and 
gave ScrEv_get_receipt
me 
a 
due 
date 
. 
then 
i 
was ScrEv_leave
on 
my 
way 
. 
that 
's 
how 
i 
borrowed ScrEv_take_book
a 
book 
from 
the 
library 
. 
<end_of_story>_library 
today 
i 
got+up UnrelEv_library
a 
little 
early 
to 
get+to+the+library Evoking_library
as 
soon 
as 
it 
opened RelNScrEv_library
. 
it 
's UnrelEv_library
about 
a 
523 
minute 
trip 
, 
but 
i 
love UnrelEv_library
the 
drive 
. 
as 
i 
got ScrEv_get_library
to 
the 
library 
, 
the 
librarian 
greeted RelNScrEv_library
me 
with 
a 
big 
smile 
and 
made RelNScrEv_library
small 
talk 
. 
i 
then 
looked+up ScrEv_look_for_book
the 
book 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_library
on 
the 
computer 
. 
it 
was RelNScrEv_library
available 
, 
and 
i 
made ScrEv_get_shelf
my 
way 
down 
the 
long 
rows 
of 
bookshelves 
. 
i 
found ScrEv_look_for_book
my 
book 
easily 
, 
and 
i 
also 
found ScrEv_look_for_book
a 
couple 
others 
i 
'd 
like UnrelEv_library
. 
i 
carried ScrEv_take_book
my 
stack 
of 
books 
to 
the 
counter 
, 
and 
the 
same 
librarian 
was UnrelEv_library
happy 
to 
help ScrEv_register
me 
. 
she 
told UnrelEv_library
me 
my 
book 
choices 
were UnrelEv_library
great 
and 
she 
also 
recommended ScrEv_other_library
some 
further 
reading 
. 
she 
checked+out ScrEv_register
my 
books 
in 
the 
computer 
. 
two 
of 
the 
books 
needed UnrelEv_library
to 
be 
returned ScrEv_return_book
in 
two 
weeks 
and 
the 
other 
needed UnrelEv_library
to 
be 
returned ScrEv_return_book
in 
one 
week 
. 
i 
'll 
likely 
return ScrEv_return_book
them 
all 
in 
one 
week 
. 
i 
left ScrEv_leave
and 
went UnrelEv_library
to 
the 
park 
to 
start UnrelEv_library
reading RelNScrEv_library
. 
<end_of_story>_library 
in 
my 
english 
class 
i 
was 
recently 
assigned UnrelEv_library
to 
read RelNScrEv_library
the 
book 
brave 
new 
world 
. 
my 
first 
idea 
was 
to 
just 
buy UnrelEv_library
it 
but 
when 
i 
went UnrelEv_library
to 
the 
local 
bookstore 
it 
cost UnrelEv_library
$ 
523 
. 
$ 
523 
for 
a 
book 
is UnrelEv_library
more 
than 
i 
am 
willing 
to 
pay UnrelEv_library
so 
i 
decided UnrelEv_library
to 
go ScrEv_get_library
to 
the 
local 
library 
. 
calling+in ScrEv_other_library
ahead 
to 
make UnrelEv_library
sure 
that 
they 
did 
indeed 
have RelNScrEv_library
the 
book 
that 
i 
wanted ScrEv_look_for_book
, 
i 
then 
headed ScrEv_get_library
in 
the 
direction 
of 
the 
library 
. 
when 
i 
arrive ScrEv_get_library
they 
had 
already 
had Unclear_library
the 
book 
up 
front 
as 
i 
requested ScrEv_other_library
so 
that 
all 
i 
had 
to 
do UnrelEv_library
was 
go 
pick ScrEv_take_book
it 
up 
. 
or 
so 
i 
thought UnrelEv_library
. 
in 
actuality 
i 
had 
to 
spend UnrelEv_library
time 
getting ScrEv_obtain_card
a 
new 
library 
card 
. 
the 
librarian 
walked RelNScrEv_library
me 
through 
the 
process 
while 
also 
giving RelNScrEv_library
me 
a 
little 
background 
on 
the 
book 
i 
was 
about 
to 
read RelNScrEv_library
. 
after 
i 
had 
gotten ScrEv_obtain_card
my 
new 
library 
card 
i 
simply 
gave ScrEv_show_card
it 
to 
the 
librarian 
and 
she 
checked+out ScrEv_register
the 
book 
for 
me 
. 
now 
it 
is UnrelEv_library
time 
to 
dig RelNScrEv_library
in 
to 
this 
novel 
<end_of_story>_library 
i 
love UnrelEv_library
to 
borrow+books+from+the+library Evoking_library
because 
it 
is UnrelEv_library
so 
easy 
. 
i 
also 
love UnrelEv_library
it 
because 
if 
i 
return ScrEv_return_book
things 
on 
time 
, 
it 
's UnrelEv_library
totally 
free 
! 
i 
went ScrEv_get_library
to 
the 
library 
today 
to 
look+for ScrEv_look_for_book
some 
gardening 
books 
. 
i 
did 
n't 
feel UnrelEv_library
like 
using ScrEv_use_computer
the 
computer 
to 
find ScrEv_look_for_book
the 
books 
, 
so 
i 
went+through ScrEv_get_shelf
the 
dewey 
decimal 
system 
until 
i 
got ScrEv_get_shelf
to 
the 
gardening 
section 
. 
there 
were UnrelEv_library
so 
many 
shelves 
of 
gardening 
books 
! 
i 
found ScrEv_take_book
a 
few 
that 
i 
liked UnrelEv_library
and 
decided UnrelEv_library
i 
needed UnrelEv_library
a 
basket 
. 
i 
got ScrEv_other_library
one 
from 
the 
circulation 
desk 
. 
after 
that 
, 
i 
decided UnrelEv_library
to 
go 
find RelNScrEv_library
a 
movie 
and 
a 
video 
game 
for 
my 
family 
to 
enjoy UnrelEv_library
. 
i 
browsed RelNScrEv_library
through 
the 
movies 
in 
alphabetical 
order 
and 
found RelNScrEv_library
a 
copy 
of 
night 
at 
the 
museum 
for 
my 
family 
to 
enjoy UnrelEv_library
. 
i 
also 
found RelNScrEv_library
a 
copy 
of 
mario 
kart 
for 
the 
wii 
. 
i 
took ScrEv_go_check_out
my 
items 
up 
to 
the 
front 
desk 
and 
checked ScrEv_register
them 
out 
. 
i 
will 
have 
to 
return ScrEv_return_book
them 
within 
a 
week 
. 
<end_of_story>_library 
yesterday 
after 
lunch 
i 
decided UnrelEv_library
i 
wanted UnrelEv_library
a 
book 
to 
read RelNScrEv_library
. 
i 
went+to+my+local+library Evoking_library
and 
browsed ScrEv_look_for_book
the 
shelves 
for 
something 
i 
would 
enjoy UnrelEv_library
reading RelNScrEv_library
. 
after 
finding ScrEv_get_shelf
my 
favorite 
section 
of 
the 
library 
i 
looked ScrEv_look_for_book
at 
the 
titles 
of 
each 
book 
. 
i 
picked+out ScrEv_take_book
a 
book 
i 
thought+sounded UnrelEv_library
interesting 
and 
read ScrEv_other_library
the 
back 
cover 
to 
make UnrelEv_library
sure 
the 
story 
sounded UnrelEv_library
amusing 
. 
after 
reading ScrEv_other_library
the 
back 
cover 
i 
was 
excited UnrelEv_library
about 
the 
contents 
of 
the 
book 
. 
i 
took ScrEv_take_book
the 
book 
up 
to 
the 
front 
of 
the 
library 
where 
the 
librarian 
sat RelNScrEv_library
at 
her 
desk 
. 
i 
informed ScrEv_ask_librarian
her 
that 
i 
found ScrEv_take_book
the 
book 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_library
and 
was 
ready 
to 
check+out ScrEv_register
. 
she 
scanned ScrEv_register
the 
bar 
code 
on 
the 
book 
and 
let 
me 
know UnrelEv_library
it 
was 
due 
to 
be 
returned ScrEv_return_book
in 
five 
days 
. 
i 
left ScrEv_leave
the 
library 
full 
of 
anxiousness 
to 
go 
read RelNScrEv_library
my 
book 
. 
<end_of_story>_library 
i 
started UnrelEv_library
using RelNScrEv_library
my 
local 
library 
after 
i 
canceled UnrelEv_library
cable 
. 
it 
turns+out UnrelEv_library
that 
they 
have RelNScrEv_library
thousands 
of 
dvd 
's 
and 
blue 
ray 
movies 
available 
for 
free 
. 
i 
live UnrelEv_library
in 
a 
pretty 
decent 
sized UnrelEv_library
town 
, 
so 
the 
library 
is UnrelEv_library
actually 
really 
nice 
. 
one 
day 
my 
daughter 
and 
i 
were 
looking+for ScrEv_other_library
movies 
. 
she 
told UnrelEv_library
me 
about 
needing UnrelEv_library
to 
download UnrelEv_library
a 
book 
because 
she 
had 
seen UnrelEv_library
a 
movie 
recently 
and 
wanted UnrelEv_library
to 
read RelNScrEv_library
the 
book 
now 
. 
she 
was 
kind 
of 
shocked UnrelEv_library
when 
i 
suggested UnrelEv_library
that 
we 
look+for ScrEv_look_for_book
the 
book 
at 
the 
library 
. 
she 
thought UnrelEv_library
that 
people 
just 
used ScrEv_use_computer
the 
computers 
there 
and 
borrowed ScrEv_other_library
movies 
. 
she 
did 
not 
think UnrelEv_library
that 
they 
would 
have RelNScrEv_library
the 
book 
that 
she 
wanted ScrEv_look_for_book
. 
she 
thought UnrelEv_library
that 
the 
only 
books 
there 
were RelNScrEv_library
encyclopedias 
and 
old 
books 
. 
she 
was 
really 
surprised UnrelEv_library
when 
we 
were 
able 
to 
find ScrEv_take_book
the 
book 
that 
she 
had 
been 
wanting UnrelEv_library
to 
download UnrelEv_library
. 
now 
, 
she 
would 
rather 
read RelNScrEv_library
a 
regular 
paper 
book 
than 
read RelNScrEv_library
a 
book 
on 
her 
tablet 
. 
this 
kind 
of 
made UnrelEv_library
me 
happy 
. 
<end_of_story>_library 
i 
decided UnrelEv_library
to 
go ScrEv_get_library
to 
the 
library 
this 
morning 
as 
i 
had 
run+out RelNScrEv_library
of 
books 
to 
read RelNScrEv_library
. 
i 
still 
love UnrelEv_library
using RelNScrEv_library
the 
public 
library 
because 
they 
give UnrelEv_library
me 
the 
option 
to 
borrow ScrEv_take_book
the 
book 
. 
when 
i 
arrived ScrEv_other_library
at 
the 
library 
i 
was 
greeted RelNScrEv_library
at 
the 
door 
kindly 
, 
which 
i 
always 
like UnrelEv_library
about 
the 
public 
library 
. 
they 
feel UnrelEv_library
more 
like 
a 
friend 
of 
yours 
than 
anything 
else 
. 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_library
to 
the 
fiction 
section 
as 
i 
like UnrelEv_library
to 
read RelNScrEv_library
stories 
that 
are 
make 
believe UnrelEv_library
. 
i 
found ScrEv_take_book
a 
few 
books 
that 
i 
was 
interested UnrelEv_library
in 
reading RelNScrEv_library
and 
decided UnrelEv_library
to 
sit+down RelNScrEv_library
and 
read RelNScrEv_library
a 
few 
chapters 
of 
them 
to 
see UnrelEv_library
if 
i 
would 
like UnrelEv_library
to 
check ScrEv_register
them 
out 
. 
i 
grabbed RelNScrEv_library
myself 
a 
cup 
of 
coffee 
from 
the 
desk 
first 
and 
then 
proceeded UnrelEv_library
to 
sit+down RelNScrEv_library
and 
read RelNScrEv_library
the 
book 
. 
after 
reading RelNScrEv_library
the 
books 
for 
about 
an 
hour 
i 
decided UnrelEv_library
to 
borrow ScrEv_register
all 
523 
of 
them 
. 
i 
went ScrEv_go_check_out
to 
the 
librarian 
and 
checked ScrEv_register
them 
out 
. 
i 
then 
left ScrEv_leave
satisfied UnrelEv_library
with 
my 
experience 
. 
<end_of_story>_library 
i 
really 
wanted UnrelEv_library
to 
read RelNScrEv_library
the 
latest 
stephen 
king 
book 
, 
but 
i 
did 
n't 
want UnrelEv_library
to 
have 
to 
buy UnrelEv_library
it 
, 
so 
i 
decided UnrelEv_library
i 
could 
borrow+the+book+from+the+library Evoking_library
. 
i 
went RelNScrEv_library
online 
first 
, 
to 
check ScrEv_other_library
to 
see UnrelEv_library
if 
my 
local 
library 
had RelNScrEv_library
a 
copy 
. 
all 
their 
's 
were 
checked+out ScrEv_other_library
, 
but 
another 
nearby 
library 
had RelNScrEv_library
several 
copies 
in 
stock 
. 
they 
also 
had UnrelEv_library
a 
great 
new 
feature 
where 
i 
could 
reserve ScrEv_other_library
the 
book 
online 
, 
so 
i 
did UnrelEv_library
that 
. 
i 
drove ScrEv_get_library
to 
the 
library 
, 
and 
went ScrEv_go_check_out
straight 
to 
the 
front 
desk 
. 
i 
told ScrEv_ask_librarian
the 
librarian 
that 
i 
had 
reserved ScrEv_other_library
a 
copy 
of 
stephen 
king 
's 
new 
book 
online 
, 
and 
she 
asked ScrEv_show_card
for 
my 
library 
card 
and 
told UnrelEv_library
me 
she 
'd 
be UnrelEv_library
right 
back 
. 
she 
brought ScrEv_take_book
the 
book 
to 
the 
counter 
, 
and 
used ScrEv_register
her 
computer 
to 
confirm RelNScrEv_library
that 
i 
had 
indeed 
reserved ScrEv_other_library
a 
copy 
of 
the 
book 
online 
. 
she 
gave ScrEv_take_book
me 
the 
book 
and 
told UnrelEv_library
me 
i 
had Unclear_library
two 
weeks 
before 
it 
was 
due ScrEv_return_book
back 
. 
i 
thanked UnrelEv_library
her 
for 
it 
and 
went ScrEv_leave
home 
to 
read RelNScrEv_library
my 
new 
book 
. 
<end_of_story>_library 
i 
went+to+the+library Evoking_library
the 
other 
day 
-lrb- 
on 
saturday 
-rrb- 
to 
borrow ScrEv_take_book
a 
book 
. 
in 
the 
process 
, 
i 
stepped ScrEv_other_library
into 
the 
library 
and 
headed ScrEv_get_shelf
straight 
to 
the 
section 
of 
the 
book 
i 
wanted UnrelEv_library
to 
borrow ScrEv_take_book
. 
i 
plan UnrelEv_library
ahead 
of 
time 
where 
the 
book 
may 
be RelNScrEv_library
as 
i 
know UnrelEv_library
borrowing ScrEv_take_book
books 
at 
my 
particular 
library 
is UnrelEv_library
rather 
competitive 
. 
i 
had 
to 
find ScrEv_get_shelf
my 
way 
through 
several 
aisles 
in 
order 
to 
get ScrEv_get_shelf
to 
the 
right 
alphabetical 
order 
. 
i 
found ScrEv_other_library
the 
author 
and 
to 
my 
luck 
, 
the 
book 
i 
wanted ScrEv_look_for_book
was RelNScrEv_library
there 
. 
surprisingly 
, 
there 
were RelNScrEv_library
actually 
three 
copies 
even 
though 
the 
book 
is UnrelEv_library
rather 
popular 
. 
i 
grabbed ScrEv_take_book
the 
book 
and 
headed ScrEv_go_check_out
to 
the 
self-checkout 
register 
near 
the 
back 
of 
the 
library 
. 
i 
scanned ScrEv_show_card
my 
library 
card 
off 
my 
key 
chain 
and 
scanned ScrEv_register
the 
book 
. 
after 
confirming RelNScrEv_library
the 
entire 
transaction 
, 
i 
grabbed ScrEv_get_receipt
my 
receipt 
and 
happily 
headed ScrEv_leave
out 
the 
library 
with 
my 
newly 
borrowed ScrEv_take_book
book 
in 
hand 
.

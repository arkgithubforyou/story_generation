0	last night , i made a grocery list and went shopping . to make a list , i go through my cabinets and refrigerator and write down things that i am out of . these are always the same things like coffee and milk . then i thought of some recipes i wanted to make . i wrote down pasta shells , ricotta cheese , parmesan cheese , spinach , and tomato sauce . i am going to make stuffed shells this week ! when i got to the store , i got my reusable bags out of the car . using no plastic bags is a great way to help the environment . since i went to the store around 523 p.m. , it was n't very crowded . i could relax as i moved my way from produce , dry goods , and then dairy . i saw a huge display of easter candy because it is march and the holiday is coming up . i was so tempted to buy a lot of chocolate but i did n't . i only try to get treats once in awhile . finally , i went to the front check out . the cashier was nice and the bagger was happy to use my own bags . i got home and put everything away . now i ca n't wait to make my stuffed shells for dinner !	grocery	grocery shopping	"['make a shopping list', 'go to grocery store', 'take bags', 'move along the sections', 'get groceries', 'go to checkout', 'pack groceries', 'leave']"	"['A.
